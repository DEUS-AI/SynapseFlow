It's important to listen to your body and consult with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns. Here's a set of exercises and stretches that can help you relieve tension and improve your physical condition while working at a desk:

### Seated Stretches

1. **Neck Stretch:**
   - Sit up straight and gently tilt your head towards your right shoulder, holding for 15-30 seconds. Repeat on the left side.
   - *Benefit:* Relieves tension in the neck and shoulders.

2. **Shoulder Rolls:**
   - Sit with your back straight. Roll your shoulders forward in a circular motion for 10 seconds, then reverse the direction.
   - *Benefit:* Eases shoulder tension and improves mobility.

3. **Wrist Flexor Stretch:**
   - Extend one arm in front of you with the palm facing up. Use your opposite hand to gently pull back on your fingers. Hold for 15-30 seconds and switch sides.
   - *Benefit:* Reduces wrist strain from typing.

4. **Seated Torso Twist:**
   - Sit up straight and place your right hand on the back of your chair. Gently twist your torso to the right, holding for 15-30 seconds. Repeat on the left side.
   - *Benefit:* Relieves tension in the back and improves spinal flexibility.

### Standing Stretches

1. **Forward Bend:**
   - Stand with feet hip-width apart. Bend forward at the hips, letting your arms dangle towards the floor. Hold for 15-30 seconds.
   - *Benefit:* Stretches the back and hamstrings.

2. **Calf Stretch:**
   - Stand facing a wall. Place your hands on the wall at shoulder height and step one foot back, keeping it straight. Lean into the wall until you feel a stretch in your calf. Hold for 15-30 seconds and switch sides.
   - *Benefit:* Relieves tension in the legs, especially if you've been sitting for long periods.

3. **Standing Quadriceps Stretch:**
   - Stand on one leg and bring your other foot up behind you, holding it with your hand. Keep your knees close together and hold for 15-30 seconds. Switch legs.
   - *Benefit:* Stretches the front of the thighs.

### Eye Strain and Posture Exercises

1. **20-20-20 Rule:**
   - Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.
   - *Benefit:* Reduces eye strain from screen time.

2. **Posture Reset:**
   - Sit or stand with your feet flat on the floor. Roll your shoulders back and down, and slightly tuck your chin. Hold for a few breaths.
   - *Benefit:* Improves posture and reduces back and neck strain.

3. **Eye Palming:**
   - Rub your hands together to warm them, then gently cup them over your closed eyes for 30 seconds.
   - *Benefit:* Relaxes eye muscles and reduces fatigue.

### Suggested Schedule

- **Every 1-2 hours:** Take a break to perform a mix of seated and standing stretches.
- **Every 20 minutes:** Practice the 20-20-20 rule for eye strain.
- **At lunchtime:** Dedicate a few minutes for deeper stretches, like the forward bend or calf stretch.

Remember, these exercises are meant to be gentle and should not cause discomfort. If you experience any pain, please stop and consult your healthcare provider. I hope these help you feel more comfortable and energized throughout your day!",
