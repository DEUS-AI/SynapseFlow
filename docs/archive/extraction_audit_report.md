## Executive Summary

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Entities | 15,702 | — |
| Total Orphans | 46 | 🟢 LOW |
| Orphan Rate | 0.3% | — |
| Total Relationships | 31,540 | — |
| Ontology Coverage | 6.2% | 🔴 |
| Entities Without Mapping | 14,725 | — |

## Root Cause Analysis

1. Relationship concentration: Top node has 6257 connections. Relationships may be concentrated in a small subset of nodes.
2. Low ontology coverage (6.2%): 14725 entities lack type mapping. These cannot participate in hierarchical (IS_A) relationships.
3. Unmapped entity types: Chunk, BusinessConcept, Business Concept, Data Product, Person. These types are not in the ontology registry.

---

## Recommendations

1. Phase 1: Extend ontology with missing types. Current coverage: 6.2%. Target: >80%.
2. Phase 4: Implement per-document quality monitoring. Alert when document orphan rate exceeds 30%.
