ABSTRACT
Systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE)
is  a  chronic  multisystem  auto-immune
disease  with  extremely  varied  clinical
manifestations  and  a  complex  patho-
genesis.  New  insights  in  SLE  about
pathogenetic  pathways,  biomarkers,
and data on clinical manifestations are
progressively emerging, and new drugs
and  new  therapeutic  strategies  have
been  proposed  to  improve  the  control
of disease activity. Thus, this review is
aimed  to  summarise  the  most  relevant
data about SLE emerged during 2021,
following the previous annual review of
this series.

Introduction
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is
a chronic autoimmune systemic disease
with a wide range of clinical manifesta-
tions that predominantly affects women.
We  performed  a  Medline  search  of
English  language  articles  published
from 1st January to 1st December 2021
using MESH terms and free text words
for the following search keys: systemic
lupus  erythematosus  AND  pathogene-
sis, biomarkers, clinical manifestations,
comorbidities,  remission,  low  disease
activity,  patients  reported  outcomes,
therapy.  We  reviewed  all  the  papers
and  selected  the  most  relevant  articles
regarding adult SLE excluding reviews
and case reports.
Thus, the aim of this review was to de-
scribe  the  most  relevant  data  on  SLE
that  emerged  during  the  past  year  fol-
lowing  the  previous  “One  year  in  re-
view” of this series (1-3).

Pathogenesis
SLE pathogenesis is the result of com-
plex interactions between genetic, epi-
genetic, immunoregulatory, ethnic, hor-
monal  and  environmental  factors,  and
several key points of these multifactori-
al connections are still unclear. It is well
known that SLE, as other autoimmune

conditions,  is  a  female-predominant
disease. The origins of this sex bias are
poorly understood, suggesting the pres-
ence  of  hormonal  or  X-linked  genetic
factors.
Recently,  Yu  et  al.  explored  the  func-
tion of XIST, a long non-coding RNA,
which  is  essential  for  X  chromosome
inactivation in female cells in the early
stages of development. In adult B cells,
XIST  plays  an  important  role  in  the
regulation  of  X-linked  immune  genes
such as TLR7. Through the analysis of
single-cell transcriptome data from fe-
male patients affected by SLE or COV-
ID-19  infection,  XIST  and  XIST-de-
pendent  genes  (including  TLR7)  were
found to be dysregulated. An important
consequence of TLR7 agonism, due to
XIST inactivation, is the promotion of
isotype-switching CD11c+ cells, atypi-
cal memory B cells (ABCs); this unique
B  cell  population  gained  an  important
role  in  aging,  infectious  diseases  and
female-biased  autoimmunity  (4,  5).
Thanks  to  these  findings  XIST  seems
to  have  a  growing  role  in  sex-related
pathophysiological  differences  in  SLE
and in other diseases (6).
Another  interesting  study  published
during the last year was focused on ge-
netic  and  epigenetic  regulations  of  B
cells activity in SLE; Pyfrom et al. pro-
filed the epigenetic features of inactive
X  chromosome  (Xi)  in  human  B  cell
subsets  from  paediatric  and  adult  SLE
patients  compared  to  healthy  controls
through  RNA  fluorescence  in  situ  hy-
bridation and immunofluorescence. The
results  revealed  an  aberrant  X-linked
gene expression form the Xi in human
SLE  B  cells,  suggesting  an  important
contribute of X-linked gene expression
on female bias in SLE (7).
During  2021,  several  studies  were  fo-
cused  on  different  cytokines  pathways
in SLE, analyzing cytokine expression
levels  in  different  biological  samples
from  SLE  patients,  trying  to  suggest

Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2022possible  new  targets  for  therapies.  In
a  recent  paper,  Peng  et  al.  examined
tear  samples  from  patients  affected  by
Sjögren  syndrome  (SS)  and  SLE  with
established  dry  eye  syndrome  (DE),
analysing  T-helper  17  (Th17)  cell-re-
lated  cytokines,  including  interleukin
(IL)-1b, IL-2, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-y,
IL-6, IL-8, IL-17F, tumour necrosis fac-
tor  (TNF)-α,  IL-21,  IL-22,  and  IL-23.
Cytokines levels in these patients were
assessed  and  compared  with  healthy
controls and patients with non-specific
dry  eye  disease.  The  study  showed
abnormal  regulation  of  Th17  expres-
sion  pathway  in  SLE  and  SS  patients,
suggesting  a  pathogenetic  role  in  DE.
Particularly  Th17  related  cytokines,
such as IL-8 and IL-21 may become a
potential therapeutic target in SLE and
SS DE (8).
The  pathogenesis  of  articular  involve-
ment  in  SLE  is  also  unclear. A  recent
study  explored  cytokines  pathways  in
SLE  arthritis,  assessing  cytokines  ex-
pression level and cellular composition
in  synovial  fluids  of  SLE  patients,  ex-
cluding  the  presence  of  comorbidities
such  as  osteoarthritis  or  overlap  with
rheumatoid  arthritis.  IL-17a  and  IL-6
levels  were  found  to  be  high  in  SLE
synovial  fluid,  as  well  as  a  subset  of
the  synovial  CD4+  T  cells  expressing
CCR6+, a marker associated with Th-17
pathway. These data suggest a potential
implication  of Th17  cytokine  pathway
in pathogenesis of lupus arthritis (9).
Other  cytokine  pathways  potentially
involved  in  SLE  pathogenesis  have
been explored in recent studies. A me-
ta-analysis was focused on the associa-
tion between circulating level of IL-18
and SLE. The results showed a signifi-
cantly higher level of circulating IL-18
in  SLE  patients  in  comparison  with
healthy  controls,  especially  in  patients
with higher Systemic Lupus Erythema-
tosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)
scores, Asian, European, Arab or mixed
ethnicity,  suggesting  an  underlying
pathogenetic role of IL-18 in SLE (10).
Likewise,  Ma  et  al.,  investigated  the
role of IL-18 and IL-18 receptor acces-
sory protein (IL18RAP) as neutrophils-
driving  cytokine.  In  neutrophils  from
SLE  patients,  particularly  those  with
a history of renal involvement or high

disease activity, elevated expression of
IL18RAP  was  found.  Moreover,  neu-
trophils showed higher IL-18-mediated
enhancement  in  activity  by  reactive
oxygen  species  production  and  could
be neutralised by anti-IL18RAP block-
ing  antibodies.  These  data  reveal  that
IL-18  likely  contribute  to  SLE  patho-
genesis  through  mediation  of  neutro-
phil  dysfunction  via  the  upregulation
of IL18RAP expression (11).

Take home messages on
pathogenesis
•  New evidences suggest that sex-bias
in SLE is likely related to epigenet-
ically-induced  modifications  in  X-
linked  immunity  genes  expression,
especially in B cells-driven autoim-
munity (4-7);

•   the T helper 17 (Th17) pathway has
been implicated in several aspects of
SLE disease pathogenesis (8, 9);
•   IL-18 is confirmed to have a recog-
nised  role  in  SLE  disease  progres-
sion and activity (10, 11).

Biomarkers
To date, only few biomarkers for SLE
are validated and used in clinical prac-
tice,  but  many  are  under  investigation
for  early  diagnosis  and  disease  moni-
toring.
Yang and et al. recently analysed trans-
fer  RNA  (tRNA)-derived  small  non-
coding  RNA  (tsRNA)  signatures  in
the serum of 192 SLE patients and 109
controls.  tRF-His-GTG-1  was  signifi-
cantly upregulated in SLE and, in com-
bination  with  anti-dsDNA,  allowed
a  fairly  good  discrimination  between
SLE patients and controls (12).
The Zeus study group (13) determined
the  serum  levels  of  five  antibodies  of
IgG2  isotype,  namely  anti-dsDNA,
anti-H2/H3, anti-C1q, anti-αΕΝΟ and
ANXA1, in 1052 SLE patients with lu-
pus nephritis (LN). The full panel was
highly  discriminatory  between  SLE/
LN  patients  and  healthy  subjects. Ad-
ditionally, anti-H2A, anti-ANXA1 and
anti-dsDNA  were  able  to  discriminate
between  SLE/LN  and  other  rheuma-
tologic  conditions;  anti−ΕΝΟ1  and
anti-H2 IgG2 were specific for the LN
subgroup and their levels had a positive
correlation with SLEDAI.

Khadjinova and colleagues (14) inves-
tigated  the  presence  of  recombinant
envelope (Env) protein and anti-human
endogenous  retrovirus  K  (HERV-K)
Env  autoantibodies  in  the  serum  of
SLE  patients  and  of  control  patients.
The  results  showed  that  patients  with
SLE had a higher titre of anti-HERV-K
Env autoantibodies in comparison with
healthy controls and patients with other
rheumatic conditions.
Dias and colleagues (15) explored pos-
sible correlations between SLE disease
activity and some neurotrophic factors,
responsible not only for neuronal func-
tion but also for immune system modu-
lation. Brain-derived neurotrophic fac-
tor (BDNF), neurotrophic factor-3 (NT-
3), neurotrophic factor-4 (NT-4), nerve
growth factor (NGF) and glial cell line-
derived  neurotrophic  factor  (GDNF)
levels  were  measured  in  plasma  from
34  SLE  patients  and  34  healthy  con-
trols.    GDNF,  NGF,  NT-4  and  BDNF
plasma  levels  were  significantly  lower
in  SLE  patients  than  in  controls,  and
lower levels of GDNF and BDNF cor-
related with more severe disease. To ex-
plain  these  findings,  it  was  speculated
that prolonged inflammatory conditions
like  SLE  may  decrease  the  production
of  neurotrophic  factors.  Nevertheless,
SLE  patients  had  a  higher  rate  of  de-
pression  (29%)  compared  to  matched
controls  (0%),  and  psychiatric  comor-
bidity could be a potential confounding
factor.
Moreau  et  al.  (16)  observed  that  seric
interleukin 33 (IL-33) and soluble ST2
(sST2) levels were significantly higher
in  SLE  patients  compared  with  con-
trols.  Moreover,  sST2  levels  were  sig-
nificantly  higher  in  patients  with  LN
and  significantly  correlated  with  SLE-
DAI.  In  renal  biopsies  no  differences
were found in IL-33 immunoreactivity,
while  sST2L  expression  was  signifi-
cantly higher in patients with LN com-
pared with controls.
In  another  case-control  study  involv-
ing  200  female  SLE  patients  and  age,
sex,  matched  healthy  controls,  CD14
(C-159T)  polymorphism  was  associ-
ated  with  an  increased  predisposition
to  the  development  of  SLE  and  LN,
and soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels had
a  positive  correlation  with  SLEDAI-

representing  a  potential  biomarker  of
disease activity (17).
To date, renal biopsy represents the gold
standard for the diagnosis and classifi-
cation  of  nephritis.  However,  there  is
an increasing interest in serum and uri-
nary biomarkers to find a less invasive
alternative for monitoring and predict-
ing  treatment  response. Among  poten-
tial biomarkers, we find tumor necrosis
factor  (TNF)-like  weak  inducer  of  ap-
optosis (TWEAK), a TNF superfamily
cytokine that is frequently up-regulated
in  the  blood  and  urine  from  patients
with  active  LN.  In  a  recent  metanaly-
sis (18) the overall pooled sensitivity of
TWEAK was 0.69, the specificity was
0.77. The overall pooled positive likeli-
hood ratio (LR) was 3.31 and the nega-
tive LR 0.38.
In a recent study, Yu et al. (19) observed
that seric syndecan-1, hyaluronan (HA)
and  thrombomodulin  levels  were  sig-
nificantly  higher  during  active  LN
compared  with  remission.  Syndecan-1
was  highly  effective  in  discriminating
between  active  LN,  healthy  subjects,
patients with non-lupus chronic kidney
disease  and  inactive  LN,  while  it  was
less specific in distinguishing active re-
nal and non-renal involvement. Throm-
bomodulin enabled a good discrimina-
tion  between  active  LN,  healthy  sub-
jects and active non-renal lupus, but it
was less useful in discriminating active
LN from non-lupus chronic kidney dis-
ease. HA distinguished quite well active
LN from healthy subjects, LN patients
in remission and non-lupus chronic kid-
ney disease, but it did not discriminate
between  renal  and  non-renal  lupus.  In
kidney biopsies, syndecan-1 and throm-
bomodulin  levels  correlated  with  the
severity  of  interstitial  inflammation,
while  HA  levels  correlated  with  chro-
nicity  grading.  Moreover,  longitudinal
studies  showed  that  HA  levels  ran  in
parallel with LN activity, increasing at
the time of nephritic flare, and decreas-
ing with treatment response. Converse-
ly,  syndecan-1  and  thrombomodulin
increased 3.6 months before the clinical
renal flare, and they can therefore be re-
garded as potential early biomarkers of
renal involvement.
Davies et al. (20) collected urine sam-


ples from 197 SLE patients (75 with ac-
tive renal involvement) and 48 healthy
controls  and  measured  the  concentra-
tion of a urinary panel of proteins. The
combination  of  lipocalin-like  prosta-
glandin D synthase (LPGDS), transfer-
rin, ceruloplasmin, monocyte chemoat-
tractant  protein  1  (MCP-1)  and  solu-
ble  vascular  cell  adhesion  molecule-1
(sVCAM-1)  was  a  good  predictor  of
active  LN.  Moreover,  a  combination
of  LPGDS,  transferrin, AGP-1  (alpha-
1-acid  glycoprotein),  ceruloplasmin,
MCP-1  and  sVCAM-1  predicted  good
response to rituximab (RTX) treatment
at 12 months.
Sometimes it is difficult to establish if
a persistent proteinuria is due to kidney
damage or chronically active/refractory
nephritis. As observed by Mejia-Vilet et
al. (21), urinary epidermal growth fac-
tor (EGF) was significantly lower in pa-
tients with active LN compared to that
in  patients  with  active  nonrenal  SLE,
inactive  SLE,  and  healthy  kidney  do-
nors. Moreover, the urinary EGF level
was inversely correlated with the chro-
nicity index in kidney biopsy, and lower
urinary EGF levels at the time of flare
are  associated  with  adverse  long-term
kidney outcomes.
Active SLE is associated with a higher
risk  of  thromboembolism,  especially
(but not exclusively) in the presence of
antiphospholipid  (aPL)  antibodies.  As
proposed by Ramirez et al., anti-protein
C  antibodies  (anti-PC)  might  prove  to
be  a  novel  marker  to  monitor  this  po-
tentially life-threatening risk. They per-
formed  a  cross-sectional  study  of  156
SLE;  anti-PC  positivity  was  detected
in  54.5%  of  patients  and  was  signifi-
cantly  associate  with  acquired  Protein
C Resistance (APCR); moreover, high-
avidity anti-PC positivity (26.3% of pa-
tients) was significantly associated with
thrombosis and active disease (22).
Among  cardiovascular  risk  factors,
diabetes is certainly a daunting comor-
bidity  in  SLE.  To  investigate  insulin
resistance  in  SLE,  Martín-González
and  colleagues  analysed  the  expres-
sion of Apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3) in
a  cohort  of  140  non-diabetic  patients
with SLE. As in the general population,
ApoC3  was  linked  to  pancreatic  beta-
cell impairment (23)

Another recent study on this topic (24)
demonstrated that serum amylin, a pan-
creatic  hormone  involved  in  glucose
homeostasis,  was  significantly  higher
in non-diabetic SLE patients compared
to controls, especially in patients with
higher  disease  severity  and  damage.
Multivariate  analysis  suggested  this
upregulation  to  be  independent  from
prednisone administration.
In  another  recent  paper,  Hernandez-
Molina et al .(25) investigated T folli-
cular helper cell (Tfh) profile in minor
salivary  gland  (MSG)  biopsies  from  a
small  cohort  of  patients  with  primary
SS  (pSS),  SLE/SS,  SLE  and  non-SS
sicca. In pSS there was a higher expres-
sion  of  Tfh1,  Tfh2,  and  Tfh17  cells;
conversely, Tfh17 and Tfh1 cells were
predominant  in  SLE/SS  and  SLE  pa-
tients, respectively.

Take home messages on
biomarkers
•   tRF-His-GTG-1,  IgG2  isotype  anti-
body panel and anti- human endog-
enous retrovirus K envelope autoan-
tibodies  seems  to  be  potential  diag-
nostic biomarkers (12-14);

•   neurotrophic  factors,  IL-33,  soluble
ST2 and soluble CD14 are potential
biomarkers  for  disease  monitoring
(15-17);

•   potential biomarkers for active lupus
nephritis  include:  seric  syndecan-1,
hyaluronan  and
thrombomodulin;
urinary  EGF;  combination  of  uri-
nary  lipocalin-like  prostaglandin  D
synthase, transferrin, ceruloplasmin,
MCP-1 and sVCAM-1 (19-21);
•   apolipoprotein C3 and amylin are bi-
omarkers for insulin resistance, and
anti-protein  C  antibodies  increase
thromboembolic risk (22-24).

Clinical manifestations
and comorbidities
In  the  neuropsychiatric  (NP)  field,
Hanly  et  al.  further  advance  the  un-
derstanding of the outcome of nervous
system manifestations in SLE patients
identifying  the  variables  associated
with  the  development  and  resolution
of  NP  events  over  time  (26).  Over  12
(1999–2011),  1.827  patients
years
were  recruited  into  the  Systemic  Lu-
pus International Collaborating Clinics

Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2022One year in review 2022: SLE / D. Zucchi et al.(SLICC)  prospective  inception  cohort
for a total of 1.910 NP events (52.3%),
of these 593 (31.0%) attributed to SLE.
Factors  associated  with  the  onset  of
NP events attributed to SLE were male
sex,  concurrent  NP  events  not  attrib-
uted  to  SLE  and  excluding  headache,
SLEDAI-2K without NP variables and
glucocorticoid  use  (26).  Conversely,
there  was  a  negative  association  with
Asian  race,  postsecondary  education
and  antimalarial  drug  use.  NP  events
attributed to SLE had a higher resolu-
tion  rate  than  NP  manifestations  not
attributed  to  SLE.  Factors  associated
with the resolution of NP events attrib-
uted to the diseases were the Asian race
and any central/focal NP event (26).
Attributing  NP  manifestations  to  SLE
is  often  challenging.  Brain  white  mat-
ter (WM) lesions are frequent in SLE at
MRI, but their diagnostic role is unclear.
Ramirez  et  al.  assessed  whether  WM
lesions  count,  volume  and  distribution
measurement  can  help  in  the  diagnosis
of  NPSLE  (27).  Patients  with  NPSLE
had  higher  WM  lesions  volume  than
patients  without  NP  involvement  and
healthy controls. Thresholds of WM hy-
perintense  WM  lesion  volume  ≥0.423
cm3  or  ≥12  were  associated  with  defi-
nite NPSLE and improved the classifica-
tion of patients with possible NPSLE ac-
cording to clinical judgment (27). Inter-
estingly, a pilot study investigated WM
microstructural  changes  in  newly  diag-
nosed SLE patients, even in the absence
of  clinically  manifested  NP  events.
Evaluating the longitudinal variations in
diffusion  tensor  imaging  (DTI)  metrics
of  different  WM  tracts  the  authors  ob-
served that mean diffusivity (expression
of the motion of water molecules within
the tissue, sensitive to cellularity, oede-
ma)  and  radial  diffusivity  (a  parameter
sensitive to changes in axonal diameter
and density due to demyelination as well
as other perturbations that may affect the
interstitial space) significantly increased
over  time  (28).  These  findings  suggest
that the deterioration of the integrity of
WM starts in the early phases of the SLE
course and calls for better monitoring of
WM tissue.
LN  is  another  major  organ  involve-
ment  described  approximately  in  50%
of patients with SLE that can progress

to end-stage renal disease in 10% of the
case. Prediction of outcomes at the time
of  LN  diagnosis  can  guide  decisions
regarding  intensity  of  monitoring  and
therapy  for  treatment  response.  In  this
view,  a  combination  of  renal  pathol-
ogy results and routine clinical labora-
tory  data  was  used  to  develop  and  to
cross-validate  a  clinically  meaningful
machine  learning  decision  tool  able  to
predict LN outcomes at approximately
1  year. A  report  provided,  for  the  first
time,  five  different  machine  learning
models based on the inclusion of seven
predictors that were interstitial inflam-
mation,
interstitial  fibrosis,  activity
score  and  chronicity  score  from  renal
pathology  and  urine  protein  to  creati-
nine  ratio,  white  blood  cell  count  and
haemoglobin  from  the  clinical  labora-
tories (29).
Still in the framework of renal function,
Yip et al. characterised the longitudinal
variation of estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate (eGFR) in the Hopkins Lupus
Cohort identifying three different states:
declining (<4 mL/min/1.73m2 per year),
stable (<4 to 4mL/min/1.73 m2 per year)
and increasing (>4mL/min/1.73 m2 per
year)  states.  In  adjusted  analyses,  high
blood  pressure,  C4  and  low  haemato-
crit were associated with a change from
non-declining  to  declining  state.  High
urine  protein-to-creatinine  ratio  also
tended  to  be  associated  with  a  change
from  non-declining  to  declining  state,
while  the  use  of  prednisone  stabilises
the declining eGFR trajectory (30). Re-
garding  end-stage  renal  disease  related
to  LN,  a  retrospective  study  evaluated
the  long-term  post-transplant  graft  and
patient survival in LN compared to pa-
tients  with  polycystic  kidney  disease
(31). In total, 53 kidney transplanted pa-
tients were included, 21 in the LN group
and 32 in the polycystic kidney disease
group.  No  significant  differences  were
found regarding graft or patient survival
at 20 years of follow-up (31). Finally, a
retrospective  study  characterised  pre-
dictors  of  chronic  damage  accrual  and
mortality in LN over 18 years of obser-
vation.  At  multivariate  analysis,  high
blood pressure, presentation with acute
renal  dysfunction  and  average  pred-
nisone  dose  >5mg/day  independently
predicted  damage.  Age,  hypertension,

and maintenance therapy with immuno-
suppressants predicted mortality (32).
SLE
is  associated  with  consider-
able morbidity and mortality. A recent
analysis conducted a population-based
cohort  study  containing  computerised
medical records of 10 million patients,
representing  8%  of  the  British  popu-
lation,  estimated  the  risk  of  mortality
in  4.343  patients  with  SLE  compared
with  21.780  matched  controls  (33).
SLE  conferred  a  1.8-fold  increased
mortality  rate  for  all-cause  compared
with matched subjects. The age-specif-
ic mortality risk was highest in patients
aged 18–39 years. After adjustment for
potential  confounders  (history  of  sei-
zures, renal disease, and recent use of
glucocorticoids (GCs), antimalarials or
antidiabetics),  mortality  rates  for  car-
diovascular disease, infectious disease,
non-infectious  respiratory  disease  and
death  attributable  to  accidents  or  sui-
cide were all significantly increased in
SLE  patients  compared  with  matched
controls, whereas the mortality rate for
cancer was reduced (33).
Malignancy  is  potential  comorbidity
in patients with SLE. Clarke et al. elu-
cidated  the  risk  of  malignancy  type  in
SLE  patients  performing  a  systematic
review  and  meta-analysis.  Forty-one
studies  reporting  on  40  malignancies
(one  overall,  39  site-specific)  were  in-
cluded (34). The pooled risk ratio (RR)
for all malignancies from 3.694 events
across  80.833  patients  was  1.18.  The
authors  identified  24  site-specific  ma-
lignancies  with  increased  risk,  includ-
ing  reproductive  cancers  (cervical,  va-
gina/vulva),  all  haematologic  cancers,
all  liver  and  hepatobiliary  cancers,  all
respiratory cancers, stomach, oesopha-
gus,  colon  and  anal  cancers  and  other
cancers  (bladder,  thyroid,  brain  and
nervous  system)  (34).  For  11  site-spe-
cific malignancies including all gynae-
cologic  and  ovarian,  gastrointestinal
cancers  (pancreas,  colorectal,  all  gas-
trointestinal,  rectal,  oral,  small  intes-
tine),  skin  cancer  (non-melanoma,  all
skin),  and  kidney  cancer  there  was  no
evidence of increased risk. A decreased
risk  was  reported  for  breast,  uterine,
melanoma,  and  prostate  cancers  (34).
Novel  data  from  a  large,  multicentre
inception  SLE  cohort  explored  how

be associated with specific risk factors
(35).  In  this  study,  multivariate  analy-
ses  indicated  that  overall  cancer  risk
was  related  primarily  to  male  sex  and
older age at SLE diagnosis. In addition,
smoking was associated with lung can-
cer.  Immunosuppressive  medications
were not associated with higher risk ex-
cept for cyclophosphamide (CYC) and
non-melanoma  skin  cancer.  Antima-
larials were negatively associated with
breast  cancer  and  nonmelanoma  skin
cancer  risk.  SLE  activity  was  associ-
ated positively with hematologic cancer
and negatively with nonmelanoma skin
cancer (35).
With  regards  to  infection,  a  nation-
wide  study  examined  the  time  trends
and  outcomes  of  5  common  hospital-
ised  infections  in  patients  with  SLE,
namely,  pneumonia,  sepsis/bacterae-
mia,  urinary  tract  infection,  skin  and
soft tissue infections, and opportunistic
infections  (36).  The  rates  of  hospital-
ised  infections  increased  over  time
from 1998 to 2016 patients with SLE,
and sepsis surpassed pneumonia as the
most  common  hospitalised  infection.
SLE patients hospitalised for one of the
five  included  infections  were  younger
in age (median age lower by 13 years),
were more likely to be female and to be
in the lowest income quartile compared
with non-SLE patients (36).

Take home messages on clinical
manifestations and comorbidities:
•   Neuropsychiatric (NP) events attrib-
uted to SLE have a higher resolution
rate  than  NP  manifestations  not  at-
tributed  to  SLE.  The  resolution  is
more  common  in  patients  of Asian
race and for central/focal NP mani-
festations (26);

•   in lupus nephritis, presentation with
acute renal dysfunction, presence of
arterial  hypertension  and  corticos-
teroids  dose  independently  predict
damage increase over time (32);
•   SLE is associated with a 1.8-fold in-
creased  mortality  rate  for  all-cause
mortality (33);

•   the  rates  of  hospitalised  infections
are increasing over time in patients
with  SLE,  and  sepsis  is  the  most
common hospitalised infection (36).


Therapy
New potential therapeutic targets:
phase I and II studies
New insights in the pathogenesis of SLE
and advances in biotechnology provided
new potential therapeutic targets.
In  2021,  tyrosin  kinase  inhibitors  have
been investigated as potential treatment
targets  for  SLE  patients.  Hasni  et  al.
(37)  reported  the  results  of  the  phase
1  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  trial  with  tofacitinib.  In  this
study 30 SLE patients were randomised
to tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) or pla-
cebo in 2:1 block. Tofacitinib was found
to  have  a  good  safety  profile  in  SLE
and  the  study  showed  that  tofacitinib
improves  cardiometabolic  profile  with
possible role in preventing atherosclero-
sis in SLE patients.
A  phase  II,  randomised,  double-blind,
placebo-controlled  trial  was  recently
conducted to assess safety and efficacy
of fenebrutinib (GDC-0853), a non-co-
valent, oral, and highly selective inhibi-
tor  of  Bruton’s  tyrosine  kinase  (BTK).
Two  hundred  and  sixty  patients  with
SLE  were  randomised  to  receive  pla-
cebo,  fenebrutinib  150  mg  once  daily,
or fenebrutinib 200 mg twice daily. The
results showed that fenebrutinib is safe
but  its  efficacy,  evaluated  with  SRI-4,
was not demonstrated (38).
Furie  et  al.  (39)  assessed  efficacy  and
safety  of  dapirolizumab  pegol  (DZP),
a  polyethylene  glycol-conjugated  Fab’
fragment,  which  targets  CD40  ligand
performing  a  phase  2,  24-week,  ran-
domised,  placebo-controlled  trial  in-
cluding  182  patients.  Randomised  pa-
tients  received  placebo  or  intravenous
DZP  (6/24/45 mg/kg)  and  standard-of-
care  (SOC)  treatment  every  4 weeks  to
week 24. After 24 weeks, DZP appeared
to be well tolerated and an improvement
of  clinical  and  immunological  param-
eters of disease activity was observed.
For the first time a phase IIa, open-la-
bel,  dose-escalating  study  investigated
safety and efficacy of a short course of
intravenous  arsenic  trioxide  (ATO)  in
10 patients with active SLE. ATO was
administered  with  10  intravenous  in-
fusions  within  24 days;  the  first  group
received 0.10 mg/kg per injection, with
dose-escalating to 0.15 mg/kg in a sec-
ond group, and to 0.20 mg/kg in a third

group. An acceptable safety and effica-
cy of ATO were observed (40).
The  type  I  IFN  system  is  known  to
play  a  central  role  in  the  pathogenesis
of SLE. Anifrolumab is a fully human
monoclonal  antibody  that  inhibits  ac-
tivity  of  all  type  I  IFNs.  Recently,  a
3-year,  phase  II  open-label  extension
study  confirmed  that  anifrolumab  had
an acceptable safety profile in the long-
term.  Specifically,  in  the  study  218
(88.6%) of the 246 patients who com-
pleted treatment in the MUSE phase IIb
randomised controlled trial (41) are en-
rolled; 139 (63.8%) completed 3 years
of treatment. About 70% of patients re-
ported at least one adverse event (AE)
during  the  first  year  of  the  extension
study and about 7% stopped treatment
due to AEs. During 3 years of follow-up
improvement  of  SLE  disease  activity,
quality  of  life  and  serologic  measures
were sustained (42).
Combination  therapies  are  also  one  of
the  new  frontiers  in  the  management
of  SLE  and  they  have  been  explored
in recent studies. In particular, over the
last year encouraging results have been
obtained  by  combination  therapy  with
RTX  and  belimumab.  In  this  regard,
in  an  American  multicenter,  phase  II
randomised,  open-label  clinical  trial
43 patients with recurrent or refractory
LN were treated with RTX, CYC, and
GCs,  followed  by  weekly  belimumab
infusions until week 48 or treated with
RTX, CYC and GCs alone. The results
showed that the addition of belimumab
to  RTX  and  CYC  did  not  increase  in-
cidence  of AEs;  moreover,  in  patients
treated  with  belimumab  lower  matu-
ration  of  transitional  to  naive  B  cells
was  observed  as  well  as  higher  nega-
tive  selection  of  autoreactive  B  cells
(43).  In  another  phase  2,  randomised,
double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  par-
allel-group, superiority trial, 52 patients
were treated with RTX and 4 to 8 weeks
later  were  randomly  assigned  (1:1)  to
receive intravenous belimumab or pla-
cebo  for  52  weeks.  At  52  week  com-
bination  therapy  significantly  reduced
serum anti-dsDNA antibody levels and
reduced risk for severe flare in patients
with SLE that was refractory to conven-
tional therapy (44).
Another B-cell targeted therapy is ataci-

Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2022One year in review 2022: SLE / D. Zucchi et al.cept, a human recombinant fusion pro-
tein directed both to BLyS and APRIL.
In 2021, the long-term extension (LTE)
study of ADDRESS II was published, in
this  study  Wallace  et  al.  (45)  included
253 patients whose 88 received atacic-
ept  150 mg,  82  atacicept  75 mg  and  83
placebo/atacicept 150 mg; median treat-
ment duration was 83.8 weeks; the study
confirmed efficacy and safety of atacic-
ept 150 mg also in the long-term.
Piranavan et al. described the outcome
of  73  SLE  patients  treated  with  siroli-
mus  for  more  than  3  months.  Twelve
patients were treated for renal manifes-
tations, while 61 for non-renal manifes-
tations. In both groups sirolimus led to
good  results  in  disease  activity  control
and in steroid reducing, with good tol-
erability  profile  also  in  long-term  use.
In  the  renal  group,  sirolimus  was  ad-
ministered  in  cases  of  intolerance  or
inadequate  response  to  MMF,  while  in
non-renal  patients  sirolimus  was  used
to  treat  uncontrolled  musculoskeletal,
mucocutaneous,  NP,  serositic  and  hae-
matological  manifestations  despite  the
use  of  at  least  two  “disease  modifying
antirheumatic drugs” (DMARDs) (46).
Data  of  safety  and  efficacy  of  borte-
zomib  (BTZ)  in  SLE  patients  who  did
not  respond  to  conventional  immuno-
suppressive  agents  was  reported  by
Walhelm  et  al.  This  drug  is  a  specific,
reversible,  inhibitor  of  the  20S  subunit
of  the  proteasome  and  it  was  adminis-
trated  in  combination  with  GCs.  De-
spite  the  low  number  of  cases  (12  pa-
tients),  BTZ  caused  reduction  in  SLE-
DAI, which was maintained at 6 and 12
months, increase in complement levels,
reduction of proteinuria and seroconver-
sion of anti-dsDNA. AEs were recorded
in 6 patients and the most common were
infections,  underling  the  need  to  take
care of hypogammaglobinaemia (47).

Take home messages on new
potential therapeutic targets
•   Combination therapy with rituximab
and belimumab seems to be promis-
ing treatment for refractory patients
with good safety profile (44);

•   in extension of phase II studies both
anifrolumab  and  atacicept  demon-
strated acceptable safety for also for
long period of treatment (42, 45).

New perspectives on traditional drugs
Despite  new  treatment  strategies,  GCs
remain  of  pivotal  importance  in  the
treatment of SLE and are used to treat
severe disease manifestations as well as
in the long-term as maintenance thera-
py. Data from patients with 2 consecu-
tive  years  of  clinically  quiescent  dis-
ease were analysed to assess if gradual
tapering  of  GCs  was  associated  with
different rates of clinical flare and dam-
age accrual in comparison to low dose
(5  mg/day)  prednisone  maintenance
therapy.  All  patients  (n=102  in  each
group) were followed for 2 years. Flare
rate was lower in the withdrawal group
both  at  12  (17.6%  vs.  29.4)  and  24
months  (33.3%  vs.  50%),  and  damage
accrual  was  less  frequent  in  the  with-
drawal group. So, the study suggest that
GCs  withdrawal  is  feasible  in  patients
with clinically quiescent SLE and it is
not related to a significant incidence of
flare (48).
Argolini  et  al.  have  recently  analyzed
data from 106 patients to investigate the
outcome  of  LN  patients  on  long-term
maintenance therapy with cyclosporine
(CsA),  mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)
or  azathioprine  (AZA).  All  treatments
had  similar  efficacy  in  achieving  and
maintaining  complete
remis-
sion  at  1  and  8  years,  with  similar  24
h  proteinuria,  serum  creatinine,  and
eGFR.  Flares-free  survival  curves  and
incidence  of  side-effects  were  not  sig-
nificantly different in the three groups.
Interestingly, at the beginning of main-
tenance  therapy,  CsA  patients  had  sig-
nificantly higher proteinuria or nephrot-
ic  syndrome  and  significantly  lower
complete  renal  remission  with  respect
to the other groups (49).
With  regards  to  MMF,  a  longitudinal
observational  study  was  recently  car-
ried out in 162 SLE patients to evaluate
the  5-years  drug  retention  rate  (DRR)
and  its  effectiveness  to  control  chron-
ic  damage  progression.  Most  patients
(62.3%) were assuming MMF for LN,
while  24.1%  were  treated  for  muscu-
loskeletal  manifestations.  The  median
treatment duration was 30 months, and
at  60  months  follow  up  the  DRR  was
similar  between  LN  patients  and  pa-
tients treated for other indications, with
higher  DRR  when  MMF  was  used  to

renal

treat  joint  manifestations.  During  the
follow up period about 20% of patients
discontinued MMF for AEs and 21.7%
for achieving remission. Also, the me-
dian  SLICC  Damage  Index  (SDI)  val-
ues didn’t significantly increase. These
results suggest that MMF is able to con-
trol chronic damage progression and is
effective also in non-renal involvement,
particularly in musculoskeletal involve-
ment (50).

New data on calcineurin inhibitors
Recently,  growing  interest  has  been
raised  for  calcineurin  inhibitors,  espe-
cially  in  patients  who  do  not  achieve
complete  renal  response  to  standard
treatments.
Tacrolimus,  a  calcineurin  inhibitor,  is
considered as a promising treatment op-
tion for LN. A study on long term-safe-
ty and effectiveness of this drug in 1355
Japanese patients has recently provided
interesting results. In this large popula-
tion of patients with LN, long-term tac-
rolimus  maintenance  treatment  over  5
years was well tolerated and effective.
The  most  frequent  adverse  drug  reac-
tions  were  infections,  which  generally
developed early in the treatment period
(51).
Voclosporin  is  a  novel  calcineurin  in-
hibitors developed for the treatment of
LN, and a phase 3, multicentre, double-
blind,  randomised  trial  was  recently
carried  out  to  determine  the  complete
renal  response  at  week  52  in  voclo-
sporin-treated  patients  (n=179)  versus
a  placebo  group  (n=178).  All  patients
were  also  receiving  MMF  and  low-
dose  GCs.  In  the  voclosporin  group,
patients achieved a significantly higher
complete  renal  response  rate  at  1  year
compared  to  patients  receiving  MMF
and low-dose GCs alone. Safety profile
was comparable in the two groups, sug-
gesting  voclosporin  as  an  opportunity
in patients with LN (52).

New data on biotechnological drugs
– Belimumab
Since belimumab approval, many data
have been collected about the efficacy
and safety of this drug from long-term
extension studies and real-life.
The  results  of  a  post-hoc  analysis  of
448  patients  enrolled  in  Belimumab


Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2022One year in review 2022: SLE / D. Zucchi et al.International Study in LN (BLISS-LN)
was recently published by Rovin et al.
Patients  were  randomised  to  receive
intravenous  belimumab10  mg/kg  or
placebo,  and  the  results  showed  that
add-on belimumab on standard therapy
could facilitate control of disease activ-
ity, prevent LN flares, and help to pre-
serve long-term kidney function (53).
The  results  of  the  EMBRACE  study,
a  52-week  double  blind  placebo-con-
trolled trial in 448 adult patients of self-
identified  black  race  with  active  SLE,
were  described  by  Ginzler  et  al.  The
primary endopoint, SLE Responder In-
dex–SLEDAI-2K  (SRI-S2K)  response
rate  at  week  52,  was  not  achieved  in
these  patients  who  were  receiving
monthly  intravenous  belimumab  10
mg/kg or placebo in addition to stand-
ard  therapy.  However,  SRI-S2K  re-
sponse rates were higher in belimumab
group, especially in patients with high
baseline disease activity or renal mani-
festations (54).
Gatto et al. reported results of an anal-
ysis  of  91  SLE  patients  with  renal  in-
volvement enrolled in
the BeRLiSS (Belimumab in Real Life
Setting  Study)  and  evaluated  at  6,  12
and  24  months.  The  data  confirmed
that  add-on  therapy  with  belimumab
led to durable renal response in 70.3%
of  these  patients,  who  achieved  pro-
teinuria ≤0.7 g/24 h and eGFR≥60 ml/
min/1.73 m2 without rescue therapy in
a real-life setting. Also, 38.4% of them
had complete renal response with pro-
teinuria <0.5 g/24 h and eGFR≥90 ml/
min/1.73 m2 (55).

important
Anifrolumab  resulted  an
treatment option in moderate to severe
SLE  patients  and  could  help  to  taper
GCs.  TULIP-1  and  TULIP-2  were
phase  3,  52-week  trails  in  which  pa-
tients  were  randomised  to  receive  in-
travenous  anifrolumab  (300  mg  every
4  weeks  for  48  weeks)  or  placebo.  In
patients  who  were  receiving  baseline
GCs (10 mg/day prednisone or equiva-
lent) tapering to 7.5 mg/day from weeks
8–40 was required. A post-hoc analysis
of data from these trials has shown that
patients  under  anifrolumab  treatment
(n=360) developed fewer flares and had


a  prolonged  time  to  first  flare  versus
patients in the placebo group (n=366),
and  this  result  was  confirmed  also  in
patients who tapered GCs (56).

Take home messages on new
therapies and therapeutic strategies
•   Glucocorticoids  tapering  and  with-
drawal  can  be  safe  in  patients  with
clinically quiescent SLE (48);

•   belimumab can be considered as an
add-on  therapy  for  adult  patients
with  active  lupus  nephritis  (53-55),
and  also  data  on  calcineurin  inhibi-
tors  (voclosporin  and  tacrolimus)
show  promising  results  in  renal  in-
volvement (51, 52);
•   in  patients  with

lupus  nephritis
maintenance  therapy  with  cyclo-
sporine,  mycophenolate  mofetil  or
azathioprine  had  similar  efficacy  in
achieving and maintaining complete
renal remission at 1 and 8 years (49).

Treat-to-target, remission,
LLDAS, patient-reported outcomes
Although  several  years  have  passed
since  when  the  strategy  of  “treat  to
target”  has  been  applied  in  SLE  (57),
the  optimal  approach  for  the  treat-
ment of the disease remains uncertain.
The  Definitions  Of  Remission  In  SLE
(DORIS)  initiative  was  started  in  or-
der  to  provide  a  framework  for  defin-
ing remission as the ideal target of SLE
management.  The  first  results  of  this
initiative were published in 2016 (58).
In 2020, the task force was reconvened
and,  on  the  basis  of  systematic  litera-
ture  reviews  and  data  from  individual
cohorts  and  registries,  achieved  con-
sensus on the 2021 DORIS definition of
remission in SLE which includes: clini-
cal  SLEDAI=0  and  Physician  Global
Assessment  (PhGA)  <0.5,  irrespective
of serology; the patient may be on anti-
malarials, low-dose GCs (prednisolone
<5 mg/day), and/or stable immunosup-
pressives including biologics. In detail,
the task force defined some general rec-
ommendations:  inclusion  of  serology
and  duration  in  the  DORIS  definition
of  remission  is  not  recommended;  the
SLEDAI-based definitions of remission
have been investigated more extensive-
ly than BILAG- or ECLAM-based defi-
nitions,  therefore  the  SLEDAI-based

definitions can more confidently be rec-
ommended; the definition of remission
off-treatment  is  not  recommended  for
clinical research or clinical trials as it is
achieved very rarely (59).
It  is  thought  that  this  single  definition
of remission in SLE should represent an
aspirational goal in clinical care and an
outcome in research, however it seems
that the ideal target of the management
of SLE has not yet been found. Mucke
and  co-workers  evaluated  the  agree-
ment of the DORIS definition of remis-
sion with the treating physician’s (DO-
RIS-) independent remission judgement
in a monocentric SLE cohort and they
found a discordance regarding DORIS
remission  and  the  physician’s  judge-
ment in 22.7% of cases, with a greater
number of patients considered in remis-
sion by their physicians (60).
Indeed,  the  literature  in  the  last  year
has  been  characterised  by  studies  fo-
cused  on  the  proposal  of  new  targets
for the treatment in SLE.
SLE  Disease  Activity  Score  (SLE-
DAS)  is  a  novel,  rapid  and  continu-
ous score with improved sensitivity to
change as compared with the SLEDAI-
2K  by  weighing  some  domains  like
joint  count,  proteinuria  and  the  hema-
tological  manifestations.  In  the  last
year, the Padua and the Cochin Lupus
clinics  have  derived  and  validated  the
SLE-DAS definitions for disease activ-
ity  categories  and  clinical  remission
state. The SLE-DAS cut-offs were de-
rived in Padua cohort: remission, SLE-
DAS  ≤2.08;  mild  activity,  2.08<SLE-
DAS  ≤7.64;  moderate/severe  activity,
SLE-DAS >7.64. Its performance was
assessed  against  expert  classification
in Cochin cohort and BILAG index in
BLISS-76:  sensitivity  and  specificity
resulted above 90%, 82% and 95% for
remission,  mild  and  moderate/severe
activity, respectively (61).
Abdelhady  et  al.  has  also  explored  the
validity  of  the  SLE-DAS  index  for  the
definition of Lupus Low Disease Activ-
ity  State  (LLDAS).  In  a  group  of  117
SLE  patients  they  found  a  good  agree-
ment between SLEDAI-2K-derived def-
inition of LLDAS and SLE-DAS defini-
tion,  identifying  a  SLE-DAS  cut-off  of
6.62 for the definition of LLDAS (62).
Touma  et  al.  has  recently  evaluated

Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2022One year in review 2022: SLE / D. Zucchi et al.the  performance  of  the  SLEDAI-2KG
(SLEDAI-2K  Glucocorticoids)  index
which  adds  one  additional  variable
(GCs dosage) to the SLEDAI-2K. In a
cohort of 188 SLE patients from the To-
ronto  Lupus  Clinic,  response  to  stand-
ard  of  care  therapy  at  first  follow-up
visit  was  assessed  using  the  SLEDAI-
2K  and  SLEDAI-2KG  and  the  perfor-
mances  of  the  two  indices  were  com-
pared.  The  SLEDAI-2KG  identified
97.9% responders among the SLEDAI-
2K  responders.  More  importantly,  the
SLEDAI-2KG  identified  11  (25.6%)
additional responders among SLEDAI-
2K non-responders thanks to its ability
to account for the decrease in GCs dose
(63).
Ceccarelli et al. have recently proposed
the Lupus comprehensive disease con-
trol (LupusCDC) as a unique outcome
for  the  evaluation  of  SLE  patients.  It
was  defined  as  remission  achievement
for  at  least  one  year  plus  absence  of
chronic damage progression in the pre-
vious  one  year.  In  their  longitudinal
analysis,  including  172  patients  with
5-years follow-up and at least one visit
per year, they found that the failure to
reach  this  condition  was  significantly
associated  with  renal  involvement  and
with  the  intake  of  immunosuppressant
drugs and GCs (64).
Effective treatment strategies to control
disease  activity  and  prevent  flares  are
important  to  improve  patients’  percep-
tion  of  their  health  status.  It  has  been
demonstrated that flaring SLE patients
have worse Patient Reported Outcomes
(PROs)  (65),  however,  there  is  no  lin-
ear correlation between a good control
of disease activity and the improvement
of  patients’  Health  Related  Quality  of
Life (HRQoL).
Actually,  all  “treat  to  target”  defini-
tions  are  based  on  validated  clinician-
assessed  instruments,  while  PROs  are
not  included.  Therefore,  patients  and
physicians  may  have  different  expec-
tations  of  remission  and  low  disease
activity  states,  which  may  ultimately
lead to the failure to improve patients’
HRQoL and to patients’ dissatisfaction
with treatment (66).
In  a  recent  study  by  Sloan  et  al.,  con-
ducted  with  a  mixed  methodology  in-
volving  thematic  analysis  of  in-depth

interviews  to  further  explore  quantita-
tive  survey  findings,  satisfaction  with
medical  care  was  significantly  lower
for non-adherent patients and for those
not  reporting  non-adherence  to  their
physicians,  particularly  in  relation  to
support,  information  and  physician’s
listening skills. Moreover, the immedi-
ate effect on symptom control and im-
proving  QoL  was  the  most  frequently
cited reason for medication adherence,
whereas preventing organ damage and/
or  death  -which  represent  physicians’
main goals- was only cited by <10% of
participants (67).
In  this  regard,  Gomez  et  al.  have  re-
cently  determined  the  prevalence  of
adverse HRQoL outcomes (SF-36 scale
scores ≤ the 5th percentile derived from
age- and sex-matched population-based
norms, and FACIT-Fatigue scores <30)
in patients with SLE who met the pri-
mary  endpoint  of  the  BLISS-52  and
BLISS-76 trials and identified contrib-
uting  factors.  They  found  a  high  fre-
quency  of  adverse  HRQoL  outcomes,
despite  adequate  clinical  response  to
standard  therapy  plus  belimumab  or
placebo,  the  highest  in  SF-36  general
health  (29.1%),  followed  by  FACIT-
Fatigue  (25.8%)  and  SF-36  physical
functioning  (25.4%).  While  no  impact
was  documented  for  disease  activity,
established  organ  damage  contributed
to  adverse  outcome  within  physical
HRQoL aspects and add-on belimumab
was shown to be protective against ad-
verse  physical  functioning  and  severe
fatigue (68).
Actually, fatigue confirms to be one of
the most burdensome symptoms for pa-
tients  with  SLE.  Lupus  Europe,  a  ma-
jor European lupus patient association,
has  performed  a  survey  about  the  im-
pact of SLE in Europe from the patient
perspective,  involving  a  large  sample
of  4375  respondents  from  35  Euro-
pean  countries  who  reported  having
physician-confirmed SLE. Fatigue was
the  most  common  reported  symptom
(85.3%)  and  the  main  three  symptoms
that respondents would like the most to
go  away  were  “fatigue  and  weakness”
(55.1%),  joint  (49.5%)  and  muscle
(33.4%)  pain.  Moreover,  16.7%  iden-
tified  anxiety  or  depression  as  one  of
their  most  bothersome  symptoms.  Al-

most  half  of  respondents  declared  that
the disease had a medium, high or very
high impact on their ability to perform
normal daily activities (69).
Similar findings also emerged from the
analysis of factors detrimental to work
productivity in the German LuLa study,
a  longitudinal  patient-reported  study.
The  authors  found  that  impaired  work
productivity and impaired daily activi-
ties  were  frequently  reported  among
employed  SLE  patients  (almost  20–
30%)  and  that  fatigue,  disease  activity
and  pain  had  a  synergistic  detrimental
effect (70).
In the last year, the results of an online
survey of adult patients with SLE con-
ducted  in  the  US  have  also  been  pub-
lished. The authors particularly focused
on patients’ satisfaction with treatment.
As  expected,  fatigue,  musculoskeletal
pain  and  sleep  disturbances  were  the
most frequently reported symptoms (by
more than half of respondents); reduc-
ing fatigue, pain and the frequency/se-
verity of flares were the most common
treatment  goals  reported  as  ‘‘very  im-
portant”  by  participants.  It  is  also  im-
portant to note that 63% of respondents
indicated that their healthcare provider
had  not  asked  them  which  were  their
most  important  treatment  goals.  Inter-
estingly,  survey  participants  did  not
consider the reduction of corticosteroid
use  a  high  priority  of  their  treatment
strategy (66).
Thus,  it  emerges  the  controversial  re-
lationship that patients with lupus have
with  chronic  corticosteroid  treatment:
on one hand it seems that they are not
fully  aware  of  the  potential  risks  as-
sociated  with  GCs  long-term  use  and
the importance of trying to reduce the
doses; on the other hand, data from re-
cent  literature  underline  that  chronic
glucocorticoid therapy have a negative
impact  on  patients’  HRQoL.  A  study
recently  conducted  in  10  Japanese  in-
stitutions, in line with data of the previ-
ous  year  (71),  have  demonstrated  that
daily glucocorticoid doses are inverse-
ly  associated  with  emotional  health
among SLE patients in LLDAS (72).
As  already  emerged  in  the  survey  con-
ducted by Lupus Europe, mood disorders
are  frequent  among  patients  with  SLE
and  may  negatively  influence  patients’


Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2022One year in review 2022: SLE / D. Zucchi et al.HRQoL.  Cross-sectional  data  recently
obtained  from  a  cohort  of  326  adults
with SLE in the San Francisco Bay Area
have  confirmed  that  major  depression
is  quite  frequent  in  patients  with  lupus
(almost  25%  of  participants)  and  is  as-
sociated with markedly reduced HRQoL
as measured by PROMIS. In particular,
in this study depressed individuals pre-
sented worse scores on fatigue, sleep im-
pairment, negative psychosocial impact
of  illness,  satisfaction  in  discretionary
social  activities,  and  satisfaction  in  so-
cial roles (73).
Currently, most  studies only use PROs
as  secondary  endpoints  and  clinicians
still prefer to focus on clinical or labora-
tory evidence, however evidence gained
from  actively  listening  to  patients’  pri-
orities  and  individual  treatment  goals
could  build  a  more  positive  medical
relationship  and  could  also  improve
disease outcomes and reduce the signifi-
cant psychosocial impact of SLE (67).

Take home messages on
treat-to-target remission,
LLDAS, patient reported outcomes
•   The  2021  DORIS  definition  of  re-
mission in SLE has been published,
however it seems that, from the cli-
nician’s perspective, the ideal treat-
ment target for SLE has not yet been
found (59, 60);

•   patients  and  physicians  may  have
different  expectations  of  remission
and  low  disease  activity  states:  the
improvement  of  fatigue,  joint  pain
and  quality  of  life  appear  to  be  the
ideal  treatment  goals  from  the  pa-
tient’s perspective (66-71, 73).

SLE and COVID-19
During  the  last  year,  several  studies
have analysed the impact of coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19) and vaccine
against severe acute respiratory corona-
virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in SLE patients.
A  recent  systematic  review  (74)  has
identified  only  LN  as  predictor  of  se-
vere  to  critical  COVID19  in  48  COV-
ID-19 SLE patients. None of the medi-
cations  used  to  treat  SLE  was  signifi-
cantly  associated  with  the  severity  of
the  COVID-19  infection,  but  patients
with severe to critical COVID-19 were
more  likely  to  be  treated  with  predni-


solone  (50%  vs.  24%),  although  the
difference  was  not  statistically  signifi-
cant; no differences were found in age
or disease duration between those with
mild to moderate and severe to critical
COVID-19.
Saxena  et  al.  (75)  analysed  SARS-
CoV-2  IgG  antibodies  in  329  SLE  pa-
tients to provide data about efficacy and
durability  of  humoral  immunity  and
possible  protection  against  re-infection
with  SARS-CoV-2.  Patients  were  en-
rolled from the Web-based Assessment
of Autoimmune, Immune-Mediated and
Rheumatic  Patients  during  the  COV-
ID-19 pandemic (WARCOV) study and
the New York University (NYU) Lupus
Cohort, and 29 patients had a history of
COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR. The
results  showed  that  most  patients  with
SLE  and  confirmed  COVID-19  were
able to produce and maintain a serologi-
cal response despite the use of immuno-
suppressants, and the majority of them
(70%)  had  antibody  positivity  beyond
30 weeks from COVID-19 onset.
Sjöwall  et  al.  (76)  have  recently  pub-
lished  data  from  100  SLE  patients  ob-
tained  prior  to  the  introduction  of  vac-
cines. Four patients (4%) had confirmed
COVID19 during the study period, but
36%  of  the  cohort  had  SARS-CoV-2
antibodies  of  ≥1  isotype.  Interestingly,
serological signs of exposure to SARS-
CoV-2 seems to be poorly correlated to
COVID19-related symptoms and seems
to have a minor impact on SLE course.
Additionally,  GCs  and  DMARDs  did
not  show  any  effects  on  the  ability  to
mount  an  antibody  response  to  SARS-
CoV-2.
Another  important  finding  emerged
during  the  pandemic  period  was  that
treatment  discontinuation  seems  to  be
an important cause of disease flare, sug-
gesting  that  immunosuppressive  treat-
ment should not be preventatively dis-
continued in SLE patients. In an Italian
cohort of 332 SLE patients 1.8% tested
positive  for  SARS-CoV-2
infection
with  a  mild  course  of  the  disease,  and
a  significant  correlation  between  flare
and  discontinuation  of  therapy  (oc-
curred  in  11.1%  and  8,1%  of  patients,
respectively) was observed (77).
As  concern  vaccination,  data  from
the  international  vaccination  against

COVID in systemic lupus (VACOLUP)
study were recently published (78). All
patients (n=696 from 30 countries) re-
ceived at least one dose of vaccine, and
almost  half  of  patients  also  received  a
second  dose;  the  most  common  vac-
cines  were  Pfizer-BioNTech,  followed
by Sinovac, AstraZeneca and Moderna.
Flares occurred in 3% of patients with
predominant  musculoskeletal  symp-
toms  and  fatigue,  and  no  correlation
with  medications  or  previous  SLE
disease  manifestations  were  observed.
Side-effects  after  vaccination  were  re-
corded in around 50% of the cohort, but
in  most  of  cases  did  not  impair  daily
functioning  and  did  not  depend  from
different type of vaccine. So, these re-
sults suggested that COVID19 vaccina-
tion was well tolerated in SLE patients.

Take home messages on
SLE and COVID-19
•   In  SLE  patients  with  COVID-19
only  lupus  nephritis  resulted  as  a
predictor of severe to critical COV-
ID19, while none of the medications
used  to  treat  SLE  was  significantly
associated  with  the  severity  of  the
COVID-19 infection (74);

•   most  patients  with  SLE  and  con-
firmed  COVID-19  were  able  to
produce  and  maintain  a  serological
response despite the use of immuno-
suppressants (75);

•   COVID-19 vaccination seems to be
well tolerated in SLE patients (78).

Conclusion
During  the  last  year  many  interesting
data  were  published  about  SLE,  and
news  regarding  pathogenesis,  clinical
therapeutic  strategies
manifestations,
and  patients  reported  outcomes  have
been  published.  These  data,  which  un-
derline the growing interest in this com-
plex  disease,  are  summarised  in  this
review.
