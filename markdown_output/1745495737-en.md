Abstract

Inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD)  is  a  multifactorial  condition  characterized  by  chronic  inflammation  of  the  gastrointestinal  mucosa.  Despite  extensive
research, its precise etiology remains unknown. However, significant progress has been made in understanding its complex pathogenesis, which involves a
combination of genetic predisposition, environmental influences, microbial dysbiosis, and immune dysregulation. Numerous genetic loci are associated with
Crohn’s disease. Environmental factors such as smoking, dietary habits, physical activity, antibiotic exposure, and early-life influences play crucial roles in
disease initiation and progression. Dysbiosis disrupts intestinal homeostasis and exacerbates inflammation. Immune dysregulation, particularly involving the
Th1, Th2, and Th17 pathways, results in an imbalance between proinflammatory and regulatory responses, perpetuating chronic inflammation.
Keywords: Crohn’s disease, microbiota, ulcerative colitis

INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that primarily includes Crohn’s dis-
ease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The pathogenesis of IBD is multifactorial, involving a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, immune
dysregulation, environmental factors, and gut microbiota. Although the precise etiology remains unclear, it is well established that multiple con-
tributing factors collectively influence disease onset, progression, and severity (Figure 1).

Genetic susceptibility plays a crucial role in IBD pathogenesis, as evidenced by the identification of multiple risk loci associated with immune
response  regulation,  epithelial  barrier  function,  and  microbial  interactions.  Genome-wide  association  studies  have  highlighted  key  genetic
variations, such as mutations in NOD2, ATG16L1, and IL23R, which significantly contribute to disease susceptibility, particularly in Crohn’s
disease. However, genetic predisposition alone is insufficient to trigger IBD, indicating the necessity of additional environmental and immu-
nological factors.

Environmental factors, including diet, smoking, antibiotic exposure, and alterations in the gut microbiome, have been implicated in disease patho-
genesis. Smoking has been found to exert differential effects on IBD subtypes, exacerbating Crohn’s disease while providing a protective effect
against ulcerative colitis. Emerging evidence suggests that early-life antibiotic exposure and altered gut microbial composition may disrupt intes-
tinal immune homeostasis, further contributing to IBD development.

Immune dysregulation is a hallmark of IBD, characterized by an imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. In patients
with IBD, an exaggerated immune reaction to commensal gut microbiota leads to persistent intestinal inflammation. Dysregulation of key immune
pathways, including the Th1/Th17 axis in Crohn’s disease and the Th2/Th9 response in ulcerative colitis, plays a central role in disease pathogen-
esis. Additionally, cytokine networks, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and interleukin-23 (IL-23), have been
identified as pivotal mediators of inflammation, paving the way for the development of targeted biological therapies.

Given the complexity of IBD pathogenesis, ongoing research continues to explore novel mechanisms underlying disease development. Under-
standing the intricate interactions among genetic, environmental, and immune-related factors is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets and
improving disease management. This review aims to provide an updated overview of the key pathogenic mechanisms driving IBD, with a focus on
emerging insights that may shape future treatment strategies.

GENETIC FACTORS
Recent advancements in genetic research, driven by initiatives such as the Human Genome Project and the advent of genome-wide association
studies (GWAS), have uncovered various genetic risk factors for IBD. These breakthroughs have significantly enhanced our understanding of the
hereditary aspects of this disease and its molecular foundations.1,2

timately influencing both disease susceptibility and clinical presen-
tation.

Smoking
Smoking  has  a  paradoxical  effect  on  IBD. While  it  worsens  Crohn’s
disease, it appears to protect against ulcerative colitis. The mechanisms
underlying  these  effects  include  alterations  in  immune  responses,  in-
creased mucus production, and inhibition of autophagy, a process criti-
cal for maintaining cellular homeostasis.9,12–14

Physical Activity
Regular  physical  activity  is  associated  with  a  reduced  incidence  of
Crohn’s  disease.  In  patients  with  established  Crohn’s  disease,  physi-
cal activity has been linked to decreased disease activity and improved
overall well-being. However, the relationship between physical activity
and ulcerative colitis remains less clear.15

Dietary Factors
Studies suggest that a diet rich in fiber and fruits is associated with a
lower  risk  of  Crohn’s  disease,  while  high  vegetable consumption  ap-
pears to have a protective effect against ulcerative colitis. In contrast,
diets high in animal fat, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and refined carbo-
hydrates have been linked to an increased risk of IBD. Although elim-
ination  diets  and  specific  dietary  interventions,  such  as  the  Mediter-
ranean and specific carbohydrate diets, may help alleviate symptoms,
their impact on objective inflammatory markers remains uncertain due
to methodological limitations in current research.16,17

Antibiotic Use
Antibiotic  use  has  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  IBD. A
large case-control study involving 24,000 patients demonstrated a cor-
relation between the frequency of antibiotic use and an increased risk
of  developing  ulcerative  colitis  and  Crohn’s  disease.  Antibiotics  are
thought to disrupt gut microbiota composition, contributing to dysbio-
sis and intestinal inflammation.18

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
NSAIDs are known to have adverse effects on the gastrointestinal sys-
tem.  Regular  use  of  high-dose  NSAIDs  has  been  associated  with  an
increased risk of IBD.19

Hormonal Factors
Oral  contraceptives  and  hormone  replacement  therapies  have  been
linked to an increased risk of IBD in women, highlighting the potential
influence  of  hormonal  modulation  on  disease  onset  and  progression.
This  association  suggests  that  exogenous  hormonal  factors  may  con-
tribute to alterations in immune responses, gut microbiota composition,
and intestinal barrier function, all of which play critical roles in IBD
pathogenesis.20,21

Appendectomy
Appendectomy has been recognized as a risk factor for Crohn’s disease,
potentially due to immune system alterations. However, it appears to
have a protective effect against ulcerative colitis, suggesting a complex
relationship between the appendix, gut immunity, and IBD pathogen-
esis.22

Psychological Factors
A study suggested that individuals experiencing lower levels of stress
had  a  decreased  likelihood  of  developing  IBD,  indicating  a  potential
link between psychological well-being and disease risk.23


Figure 1. Factors affecting IBD pathogenesis.

Family  studies  have  reported  a  family  history  in  1.5%–28%  of  CD
cases and 1.5%–24% of UC cases.3–5 In CD, the risk is approximately
eightfold higher, whereas in UC, the risk is fourfold higher.6 However,
the incomplete concordance rates among twins suggest that genetic fac-
tors alone are insufficient to explain disease occurrence, highlighting
the role of environmental influences.7,8

To date, over 240 genetic loci have been implicated in IBD suscepti-
bility, with at least 30 loci shared between CD and UC. NOD2 is a key
player in CD, as variants of NOD2 are frequently observed in affected
patients. Studies have reported a mutation prevalence of up to one-third
in certain populations.9,10 For example, a 2006 study conducted in Tur-
key found a mutation frequency of 10.7% among patients with CD.11

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
Environmental factors play a significant role in the progression of
IBD  by  interacting  with  an  individual’s  genetic  predisposition,  ul-

MAIN POINTS

•  Complex  Pathogenesis:  IBD  arises  from  genetic  predisposition,
environmental factors, microbial dysbiosis, and immune dysregulation.
•  Genetic  and  Environmental  Influences:  Key  mutations  (NOD2,
ATG16L1,  IL23R)  increase  susceptibility,  while  smoking,  diet,  and
antibiotics affect disease risk.

•  Gut  Microbiota  Imbalance:  IBD  is  linked  to  reduced  beneficial
bacteria (Faecalibacterium, Roseburia) and increased proinflammatory
taxa (Enterobacteriaceae, Fusobacterium).
Immune Dysregulation: Crohn’s disease is driven by Th1/Th17 pathways,
ulcerative colitis by a Th2 response, leading to chronic inflammation.
•  Targeted  Therapies:  Anti-TNF  agents  and  IL-23  inhibitors  help


modulate immune pathways and improve patient outcomes.

Exposures During Infancy
Early postnatal factors, such as breastfeeding, mode of delivery (vag-
inal  vs.  cesarean),  and  antibiotic  exposure,  influence  gut  microbiota
development and immune system maturation. These factors have been
associated with an altered risk of developing IBD later in life. Breast-
feeding, in particular, promotes intestinal barrier integrity and immune
tolerance.24–27

Other Factors
The rising prevalence of IBD in developing countries correlates with
increasing  industrialization  and  urbanization.19  Air  pollution,  dietary
changes,  and  environmental  toxins  are  believed  to  contribute  to  this
trend.

MICROBIOME
Over the past two decades, the microbiome has become a central focus
of research on IBD.28 The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in main-
taining the balance between T helper cells (Th cells) and regulatory T
cells (Tregs), ensuring equilibrium between proinflammatory and an-
ti-inflammatory responses. This highlights the essential role of gut mi-
crobiota in preserving host health and metabolic balance. Disruptions in
the composition or function of these microorganisms disturb microbial
homeostasis, leading to intestinal inflammation. This imbalance is fur-
ther exacerbated in IBD, promoting dysbiosis and altering the regula-
tion of key metabolic pathways.29

Dysbiosis is characterized by a reduction in the number, diversity, and
stability of bacterial populations within the microbiome, and these im-
balances are closely linked to the onset and progression of IBD. In indi-
viduals with IBD, a notable depletion of beneficial commensal bacteria
and essential microbial metabolites is frequently observed, further con-
tributing to disease pathogenesis and intestinal inflammation.30

The key immune changes observed in patients with IBD include:
•  Dysregulation of the Epithelial Barrier
•  Dysregulation of Immune Cells
•  Dysregulation of Secreted Mediators

Innate Immune System
The  innate  immune  system  serves  as  the  body’s  first  line  of  defense
against microbial invaders, with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-
like  receptors  (NLRs)  playing  essential  roles  in  detecting  microbial
components  and  initiating  immune  responses.  In  IBD,  dysregulated
expression  and  function  of  these  receptors  contribute  to  an  impaired
innate immune response, leading to excessive inflammation, disrupted
microbial tolerance, and increased intestinal barrier dysfunction.19

Adaptive Immune System
The adaptive immune system, primarily mediated by T and B cells, is
highly  specific  but  requires  more  time  to  become  fully  activated.  In
Crohn’s  disease,  a Th1-dominant  immune  response  drives  inflamma-
tion through excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines such
as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and TNF-α. In contrast, ulcerative colitis
is  characterized  by  a  Th2-skewed  response,  marked  by  elevated  lev-
els of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13, which contribute to mucosal in-
flammation. Additionally, Th17 cells, known to produce IL-17, IL-22,
and other proinflammatory cytokines, are increased in both conditions,
playing a crucial role in maintaining chronic inflammation and mucosal
damage.9,19

Cytokine-targeted therapies, such as anti-TNF agents and IL-23 inhib-
itors, have demonstrated efficacy in modulating immune pathways and
improving clinical outcomes.

Peer-review: Internally peer-reviewed.

Healthy gut microbiota is predominantly composed of Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes, which together constitute approximately 90% of the bac-
terial population. In patients with IBD, there is a marked reduction in
beneficial bacteria such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, alongside
an  increase  in  proinflammatory  taxa  such  as  Enterobacteriaceae  and
Fusobacterium. Dysbiosis is also characterized by a decline in microbi-
al diversity and stability, leading to impaired production of short-chain
fatty  acids  and  other  essential  metabolites  that  play  crucial  roles  in
maintaining intestinal health and immune regulation.28,31–36

Numerous studies have investigated changes in the microbiome and/or
metabolome in IBD. However, environmental factors such as nutrition,
medications,  ethnicity,  and  geographic  location  can  influence  the  gut
microbiome.  It  remains  uncertain  whether  these  microbial  alterations
are  a  driving  factor  in  the  development  of  inflammation  or  a  conse-
quence  of  the  inflammatory  process  itself. Therefore,  the  association
between the microbiome and IBD is not yet fully understood.

IMMUNE SYSTEM
Dysregulation of the immune system plays a pivotal role in the patho-
genesis  of  IBD,  involving  complex  interactions  between  innate  and
adaptive  immune  responses.  The  intestinal  immune  system  is  finely
tuned to maintain a balance between tolerating commensal microbio-
ta and mounting an effective defense against harmful pathogens. Dis-
ruptions in this equilibrium can lead to excessive immune activation,
chronic  inflammation,  and  the  development  of  IBD.  This  persistent
immune  imbalance  contributes  to  ongoing  inflammation  in  affected
individuals.
