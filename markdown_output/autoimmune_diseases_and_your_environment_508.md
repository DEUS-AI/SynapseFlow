Autoimmune Diseases and Your Environment
Autoimmune diseases are conditions in
which the immune system attacks healthy
cells in the body. A healthy immune system
can defend the body against disease and
infection; however, if the immune system
makes a mistake, it can create autoantibodies,
which target and react with a person’s own
healthy cells, tissues, and organs, leading to
autoimmune diseases. This attack can affect
any part of the body, weakening bodily
functions and can even be life-threatening.

Research at the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)
suggests that factors in our environment and
lifestyles may contribute to autoimmune
diseases.1

There are more than 100 autoimmune
diseases. Some are well known, such as Type
1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and
rheumatoid arthritis, while others are rare and
difficult to diagnose. Many patients suffer for
years before getting a proper diagnosis. Most
of these diseases have no cure, and there are
few effective treatments to ease symptoms.

Autoimmune diseases are rising,
especially in women
Data shows that autoimmunity and
autoimmune diseases are increasing in many
parts of the world. They affect at least 1 in
20 individuals in the adult U.S. population,
with substantial personal and societal costs.2
In the United Kingdom, research suggests
1 in 10 people are affected by autoimmune
diseases.3

Differences in sex are especially linked to the
chance of developing an autoimmune disease.
These diseases are twice as likely to afflict
women than men.4 The reasons underlying the
higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases in
women are not yet understood, but there is
new information about differences in immune
responses in females.5,6 Autoimmune diseases
can also affect males and females differently.

Research increasingly suggests that
autoimmune diseases likely result from the
interactions of environmental and genetic
risk factors. Autoimmune diseases seem more
common when people are in contact with
certain environmental exposures, including
smoking, crystalline silica exposure from
working with quartz or granite, and solvent
exposures, such as paint thinners and cleaners.7

The National Institutes of Health (NIH)
established an Office of Autoimmune Disease
Research8 within the Office of Research on
Women’s Health to better coordinate and
accelerate research on autoimmune diseases
across NIH. One of their initiatives, called
the Exposome in Autoimmune Diseases
Collaborating Teams Planning Awards
(EXACT-PLAN), has awarded grants to develop
several autoimmune disease research
networks to advance the study of the
exposome (the totality of all environmental
exposures and our body’s response to them
across the lifespan) in autoimmune diseases.

What is NIEHS doing?
For decades, NIEHS has researched how the
environment may affect the development of
autoimmune diseases. Research progress had
led to discoveries, such as:

•  Determining impact – NIEHS in-house

researchers found that one type of
autoantibody, called antinuclear antibodies
(ANAs), has increased nearly 50% in the U.S.
in less than 30 years. Teenagers in the study
experienced a nearly 300% increase in ANAs
between 1988 and 2012.2

•  Finding therapeutic targets – Researchers
analyzed gene regulation in children and
adults with an autoimmune disorder called
dermatomyositis and found key signaling
pathways that could be potential therapeutic
targets. The unique analysis of transcript and
protein expression together enabled the
identification of key pathways involved.9

•  Identifying risk factors for rheumatoid

arthritis – Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic
(long-lasting) autoimmune disease that
primarily affects joints.

 – Stressful life events – Varied, stressful life
events may increase the risk of developing
rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, another
systemic autoimmune disease.10 Children
who experience adverse life events, such as
abuse, poverty, or discrimination, may be
at greater risk of developing rheumatoid
arthritis in adulthood.11

 – Agricultural chemicals – Exposure to
some pesticides may play a role in the
development of rheumatoid arthritis in
male farmers.12 The same study shows that
in women who live on farms, an increased
chance of developing rheumatoid arthritis
was associated with other types of
farm-related exposures, such as painting
and using solvents.13

 – Proximity to hog farms – Researchers found

that people who lived within 8 miles of a
large swine feeding facility in North Carolina
were more likely to have an increased risk of
autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid
arthritis, than those who lived farther away.14

 – Genetics – NIEHS-funded researchers are close
to discovering why a genetic risk that increases
the chance of developing rheumatoid arthritis
is amplified by environmental pollutants, like
cigarette smoke.15

NIEHS is recruiting for clinical studies
on autoimmune disease:
•  Adult and Juvenile Myositis investigates

the causes, immune system changes,
and medical problems associated with
myositis, an inflammatory muscle
disease that can cause chronic muscle
weakness. Adults and children diagnosed
with myositis may enroll by completing
questionnaires, undergoing a detailed
medical evaluation and other testing, and
donating blood and urine samples.

•  The MYORISK Study seeks to understand
the environmental factors that may result
in dermatomyositis or polymyositis,
a form of myositis that causes muscle
weakness on both sides of the body.

•  To volunteer for a study on the causes of,
and possible treatments for, autoimmune
diseases, visit https://joinastudy.niehs.
nih.gov.

•  Identifying risk factors for myositis –

Myositis is a chronic (long-lasting)
autoimmune disease that affects muscles
and results in weakness. Dermatomyositis is a
form of myositis that includes photosensitive
skin rashes.

 – Risk from ultraviolet (UV) radiation –

Short-term UV radiation exposure, as from
outdoor sunlight, may affect the onset of
adult and juvenile dermatomyositis, an illness
with muscle weakness and skin rashes.16
The chance of illness increased as the UV
index increased to high levels in the month
before symptoms began.17

 – Genetic factors in autoimmune muscle

disease – Using DNA samples from myositis
patients of European ancestry, NIEHS
researchers identified primary genetic risk
factors associated with this autoimmune
muscle disease.18

 – Effective treatments for some patients with

myositis include targeted biologic drug
therapies.19

•  Using mice to identify new genetic causes of
autoimmune disease – In-house scientists at
NIEHS have discovered that IRGM1, a protein
in mice that helps cells clear their damaged
parts, is important in preventing autoimmune
disease.20 Mice that had the IRGM1 gene
removed develop findings very similar
to patients with Sjogren’s syndrome, an
autoimmune disease that damages the salivary
and tear glands, among other organs. Some
variants of IRGM, a similar gene in humans,
have been associated with increased risk for
autoimmune disease in people.21

•  Role of nutrition – Vitamin D may help prevent

immune dysfunction in older populations.22
For lupus patients, NIEHS-funded researchers
found that dietary micronutrients — choline,
folate, and vitamin B12 — may improve
symptoms.23
