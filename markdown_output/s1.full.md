ABSTRACT
In response to recent advancements in inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) management, the British Society
of Gastroenterology (BSG) Clinical Services and
Standards Committee (CSSC) has commissioned
the BSG IBD section to update its guidelines, last
revised in 2019. These updated guidelines aim to
complement the IBD standards and promote the use
of the national primary care diagnostic pathway for
lower gastrointestinal symptoms to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and timeliness. Formulated through a
systematic and transparent process, this document
reflects a consensus of best practices based on current
evidence. The guideline, while developed primarily
for the UK, is structured to support IBD management
internationally. It is endorsed by the BSG executive board
and CSSC without external commercial funding, with
involvement primarily supported through professional
roles in public institutions and the National Health
Service (NHS). Methodological revisions since the prior
guidelines have enhanced rigor in technical review
and development, with methodology details published
independently following peer review. In developing the
recommendations, 89 clinical experts and stakeholders
participated in an online survey, identifying primary
outcomes, such as clinical and endoscopic remission, as
well as adverse event metrics, all stratified by clinically
relevant effect sizes. These guidelines are intended to
support clinical decision- making but are not prescriptive,
recognizing that individual clinical scenarios may warrant
tailored approaches. Further research may inform future
revisions as new evidence emerges.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
CROSS IBD
General principles
 ► The Montreal phenotypic classification system

should be used in adults.

 ► Ileocolonoscopy  is  necessary  for  reliable  diag-
nosis  and  assessment  of  inflammatory  bowel
disease, particularly at initial presentation. The
endoscopist  should  take  at  least  two  biopsy
samples, each from the terminal ileum, at least
four different colonic segments and the rectum,
and identify the sites of origin clearly. Biopsies
for  the  diagnosis  of  suspected  new  inflamma-
tory  bowel  disease  (IBD)  should  be  accompa-
nied by full clinical details.

 ► All  patients  with  IBD  to  be  started  on  immu-
nomodulators  or  advanced  therapies  should
receive  written  information.  Prior  to  starting
advanced therapies, safety checks are required,
including  screening  for  risk  of  serious  and
opportunistic infections, and provision of vacci-
nations where required. An interferon-γ release
assay (IGRA) and a chest X- ray examination are
the minimum tests for low- risk patients.

 ► Vaccination  history  should  be  obtained,  and
vaccinations updated for all patients. Live vacci-
nations  may  be  given  at  least  4  weeks  before
starting,  and  at  least  3  months  after  stopping,
immunomodulators or advanced therapies. Live
vaccinations should not be given to people with
IBD receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
 ► Patients  with  IBD  receiving  immunomodula-
tors or advanced therapies should receive influ-
enza  vaccination  each  autumn,  pneumococcal
vaccination  with  a  booster  after  5  years  and
6  monthly  severe  acute  respiratory  syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV- 2) vaccination or in
accordance with the most recent best practice.
All female patients with IBD should be encour-
aged to take part in national cervical screening
and HPV vaccination programme. Live vaccines
are contraindicated if a patient is on immuno-
suppression  or  has  significant  protein  calorie
malnutrition.

 ► Recombinant  zoster  vaccination

(Shingrix)
is  recommended  for  all  patients  receiving

Guidelines

immunomodulators  or  advanced  therapies  who  are  aged
≥50 years, and in patients ≥18 years starting Janus kinase
(JAK) inhibitors.

Anaemia in IBD
 ► Iron  deficiency  anaemia  is  very  common  in  patients  with

active IBD.

Drug monitoring
 ► In  people  receiving  purine  analogues,  therapeutic  drug
monitoring (TDM) of purine analogue metabolites is recom-
mended  to  optimise  their  dosing,  alongside  routine  blood
monitoring.

 ► Consider  initiation  of  a  concomitant  immunomodulator,
with  or  before  initiation  of  anti  tumour  necrosis  factor
(anti- TNF) therapy, to reduce the risk of antidrug antibody
development.

 ► There  remains  uncertainty  about  the  benefit  of  TDM
for  anti- TNF  therapies.  When  people  receiving  anti- TNF
therapy  experience  loss  of  response,  TDM  can  be  bene-
ficial  to  guide  optimisation  strategies,  such  as  concomi-
tant  immunomodulator  introduction  and  anti- TNF  dose
adjustment.

 ► There is currently no role for TDM in people receiving non-

anti- TNF advanced therapies.

Surgery in IBD
 ► All  patients  with  IBD  admitted  to  hospital  for  any  reason
should  receive  pharmacological  venous  thromboembolism
(VTE) prophylaxis unless contraindicated.

 ► Patients undergoing IBD surgery need support of the wider
multidisciplinary  team  (MDT),  including  IBD  physicians,
surgeons,  radiologists,  clinical  nurse  specialists,  dietitians,
psychologists, and peer support.

 ► Prior to elective IBD surgery, corticosteroids should ideally
be stopped, or the dose reduced, to reduce risk of postoper-
ative complications.

 ► Postoperatively, the IBD medical team should actively review
the plan for ongoing medical therapy with the patient. Ideally,
this should be undertaken prior to discharge. Patients with
IBD who have been receiving oral corticosteroids for more
than 4 weeks prior to surgery should receive an equivalent
intravenous dose of hydrocortisone, and nil by mouth in the
perioperative period.

 ► Immunomodulators  and  advanced

therapies  can  be
continued in the perioperative period in patients requiring
surgery for IBD.

 ► Malnutrition  screening,  nutritional  assessment  and  correc-
tion  of  nutritional  status  should  be  part  of  preoperative
optimisation of all patients who require abdominal surgery
for  IBD.  Nutritional  support  (oral  nutritional  supplements
or  enteral  or  parenteral  nutrition)  should  be  provided  as
required.

Superinfection in IBD relapse
 ► Patients  with  new  or  worsening  symptoms  of  IBD  should
have  stool  cultures  for  enteroinvasive  bacterial  infections
and  stool  Clostridioides  difficile  assay.  Careful  review  of
travel and contact history should be taken, with appropriate
testing  for  amoebic  or  Shigella  dysentery  in  patients  with
relevant travel history.

 ► Patients with IBD flare requiring hospitalisation, and outpa-
tients with moderate to severe refractory IBD not responding
to immunosuppressive therapies, should have colonic tissue
sent for cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunohistochemistry or
PCR.

 ► As  systemic  inflammation  inhibits  absorption  of  iron,  iron
tablets should not be used in those with active disease.
 ► In  patients  with  inactive  disease,  no  more  than  100  mg

elemental iron should be taken daily.

 ► Ferritin  levels  up  to  100  µg/L  in  the  presence  of  inflam-
mation  may  still  reflect  iron  deficiency.  Measurement  of
iron  indices,  such  as  transferrin  saturation,  is  therefore
recommended.

 ► Other  causes  of  anaemia,  such  as  vitamin  B12  and  folate
deficiency,  marrow  suppression  due  to  anaemia  of  chronic
disease,  and  overt  blood  loss,  should  be  considered  and
managed accordingly.

 ► Treatment  of  iron  deficiency  anaemia  should  be  with  one
tablet  per  day  of  iron.  If  not  tolerated,  a  reduced  dose  of
one tablet every other day, alternative oral preparations or
parenteral iron should be considered.

Pregnancy in IBD
Pre-conception
 ► Patient  education  includes  the  importance  of  keeping  well
and  the  potential  adverse  foetal  outcomes  of  uncontrolled
IBD.

 ► Patient concerns should be explored, including risk of IBD

inheritance.

 ► General health measures include daily vitamin D, daily folic
acid (400 μg/day for everyone and 5 mg/day for those taking
sulfasalazine,  those  with  significant  small  bowel  resections
or  active  small  bowel  disease),  nutritional  optimisation,
engagement with cervical screening, smoking cessation and
up to date vaccinations.

 ► Current IBD activity should be assessed and medical therapy

optimised, to enhance efficacy and safety.

 ► If possible, a 3- month period of remission before conception

is advisable.

 ► Methotrexate, JAK inhibitors and sphyngosine-1- phosphate
(S1P)  modulators  should  be  stopped  for  at  least  3  months
before conception, to reduce the risk of teratogenicity.

 ► Individualised

for  disease
IBD  management  plans
monitoring  and  management  during  pregnancy  are
recommended.

During pregnancy
 ► Approach  to  IBD  maintenance,  IBD  relapses  and  indica-
tions for surgery in pregnant women are the same for non-
pregnant patients. An MDT approach is recommended.
 ► Therapies  with  the  best  evidence  base  for  safety  in  preg-

nancy should be prioritised.

 ► Cross- sectional  imaging  should  be  performed  as  required,
with emphasis on minimising radiation exposure and pref-
erence for ultrasound and MRI. Avoid the use of gadolinium
as part of MR enterography during pregnancy.

 ► Outpatients with active IBD should receive VTE prophylaxis

during the third trimester, unless contraindicated.

 ► All IBD patients should be assessed at least once in a consult-
ant- led obstetric clinic. Joint IBD antenatal clinics may offer
optimal care.

 ► Given the increased burden of mental health disease in people
with IBD, mental health screening should be performed with
onward  referral  to  appropriate  services  before,  during  and
after pregnancy.

Delivery and post partum
 ► Mode of delivery should be determined by obstetric consid-
erations and patient preference, except in people with active
peri- anal  disease,  ileoanal  pouch  or  ileorectal  anastomosis,
where caesarean section is often preferred.

 ► VTE prophylaxis is important after caesarean section.
 ► Medicines that are low risk in pregnancy are also low risk in

breast feeding and should be continued.

 ► Breast feeding is the preferred method of feeding and does

not affect the course of IBD.

 ► For  patients  with  IBD  receiving  appropriate  advanced
therapy,  we  suggest  that  the  drug  is  continued  throughout
pregnancy  to  minimise  the  risk  of  relapse  and  the  adverse
outcomes associated with active disease.

 ► Tofacitinib,

filgotinib,  upadacitinib,  ozanimod

and
etrasimod  are  contraindicated  during  conception,  preg-
nancy and lactation due to serious malformations found in
animal studies.

 ► Overall data from several studies have suggested that contin-
uation of vedolizumab or ustekinumab is not associated with
adverse maternal or foetal outcomes.

 ► Where  advanced  therapy  continues  during  pregnancy,  live
vaccinations  (including  BCG)  should  be  postponed  for  the
infant for the first 12 months.

 ► Non- live  vaccinations  should  be  given  according  to
standard  vaccination  schedule.  Breast  feeding  while  on
biological  therapy  is  not  likely  to  confer  an  additional
risk and vaccination decisions should be based on in utero
exposure only.

Patient education
 ► Patient  education  interventions  may  be  offered  to  patients
with IBD as an adjuvant to routine clinical practice, with the
aim  of  improving  patient  engagement,  medication  adher-
ence and reducing hospital attendances.

 ► All patients with IBD should be advised to stop smoking, and
national guidance on smoking cessation should be followed.
 ► The  use  of  digital  health  technology  should  be  offered  to
patients with IBD as an adjunct to face to face interactions,
particularly  aimed  at  improving  patient  engagement  and
medication adherence. Care must be taken not to disadvan-
tage those affected by digital poverty, and alternative inclu-
sive parallel strategies must be developed.

Ulcerative colitis
General principles
 ► A  multimodal  approach  to  monitoring  of  remission  in
patients with ulcerative colitis is advised, including clinical,
biochemical, imaging and endoscopic modalities, supported
by histology.

 ► Histological remission could be used as an adjunct to endo-
scopic remission to indicate a deeper level of healing but is
not a mandatory treatment target for ulcerative colitis.
 ► Patients with ulcerative colitis who have achieved prolonged
remission and mucosal healing with immunomodulators and/
or advanced therapies can discontinue their 5- aminosalicylic
acid (5- ASA).

 ► In  patients  with  ulcerative  colitis,  withdrawal  of  purine
analogues, or anti- TNF therapy, when used as monotherapy
or combination therapy, is associated with a significant risk
of  relapse.  Shared  decision- making  should  be  undertaken
before withdrawal.

Guidelines

Proctitis
 ► Mild  or  moderately  active  ulcerative  proctitis  should  be

treated with 5- ASA suppositories/enemas.

 ► Oral  5- ASA  or  rectal  corticosteroid  can  be  considered  as
second line in patients with ulcerative proctitis. Refractory
ulcerative proctitis may require treatment with oral corticos-
teroids, topical tacrolimus and/or advanced therapies.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis
 ► Adult  patients  with  acute  severe  ulcerative  colitis  (ASUC)
defined by Truelove and Witts’ criteria should be admitted
to hospital for assessment and intensive management.

 ► Hospitalised  patients  with  ASUC  should  have  urgent
assessment  of  blood  tests  (full  blood  count  (FBC),  C- reac-
tive  protein  (CRP),  urea  and  electrolytes  (U&E)  and  liver
function  tests  (LFTs)  including  albumin),  stool  culture,
Clostridioides  screen,  non- invasive  imaging  and  flexible
sigmoidoscopy.

 ► Hospitalised patients with ASUC should be treated with high-
dose intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone
30 mg every 12 hours or hydrocortisone 100 mg 6- hourly.
 ► Patients responding to IV corticosteroids should be treated
with  a  purine  analogue  or  suitable  maintenance  advanced
medical therapy.

 ► Patients  with  ASUC  not  responding  to  at  least  3  days  of
IV  corticosteroids,  as  judged  by  a  suitable  scoring  system,
should be treated with rescue therapy in the form of intra-
venous infliximab or ciclosporin. Ciclosporin can be bridged
to purine analogues (if naive) or a suitable advanced therapy
according to local practice.

 ► In ASUC, delay in surgery is associated with an increased risk
of surgical complications. Early referral and communication
with  specialist  colorectal  surgical  and  stoma  care  teams  is
advised.

 ► Patients with ASUC who have not responded within 7 days
of  rescue  therapy  with  infliximab  or  ciclosporin,  or  those
with  complications  (including  toxic  megacolon,  severe
haemorrhage  or  perforation),  require  subtotal  colectomy
and ileostomy.

 ► For  patients  who  do  not  respond  to  initial  IV  corticoster-
oids, an intensified dosing regimen of infliximab should be
considered in a select group of patients, especially if serum
albumin levels are low.

 ► Oral JAK inhibitors may be considered in selected patients
with  ASUC  who  are  corticosteroid- refractory  and,  after
careful consideration and counselling of benefits and risks,
via an MDT approach.

 ► Patients  with  ulcerative  colitis  should  not  undergo  pouch

surgery while taking corticosteroids.

 ► A  subtotal  colectomy  and  ileostomy  with  preservation
of  the  rectum  should  be  offered  to  patients  who  have  not
responded to medical therapy, at least by day 7 of treatment
for acute severe ulcerative colitis.

 ► Surgical resection of the colon and rectum should be offered
to patients who have chronic, active ulcerative colitis despite
optimised medical therapy.

 ► Ileoanal  anal  pouch  formation  or  end  ileostomy  provide
equivalent levels  of  quality of  life,  and  selection  should  be
guided by patient preferences and choice (Table 1).

Pouchitis
 ► Patients with ongoing symptoms after pouch surgery should
have  a  pelvic  MRI  scan,  stool  culture  and  Clostridioides

Guidelines

difficile  assay.  Pouchoscopy  should  be  performed  to  assess
the  pouchitis,  the  pre- pouch  ileum  and  the  mucosa  at  the
anal transition zone.

 ► A  2- week  course  of  ciprofloxacin  or  metronidazole  is  the
first- line  treatment  of  acute  pouchitis.  Chronic  pouchitis
may be treated with a combination of antibiotics (ciproflox-
acin, metronidazole, tinidazole, rifaximin), oral budesonide
or oral beclometasone.

 ► In the absence of other causes, patients with chronic refrac-
tory pouchitis not responding to antibiotics or locally acting
corticosteroids  may  be  offered  advanced  therapy.  Vedol-
izumab is suggested as first- line therapy.

CROHN’S DISEASE
General principles
 ► A  multimodal  approach  to  monitoring  of  remission  in
patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  is  advised,  including  clin-
ical,  biochemical,  imaging  and  endoscopic  modalities  with
histology.  The  specific  combination  of  modalities  and
frequency  of  monitoring  appointments  depends  on  disease
phenotype, therapy and duration of remission.

 ► Faecal  calprotectin  should  be  used  to  monitor  disease  in
patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  in  a  known  location,  where
there is a baseline faecal calprotectin.

Figure 1  Medical therapies for the induction and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). Drugs are grouped in
rows by quality of evidence. Magnitude of efficacy is shown per drug in parenthesis.

 ► We suggest performing small bowel capsule endoscopy when
small bowel Crohn’s disease is suspected despite normal or
inconclusive  investigations.  A  patency  capsule  should  be
considered.

 ► Cross- sectional imaging, specifically MRI and CT, and intes-
tinal ultrasound (IUS) may be used to evaluate both luminal
and extraluminal disease. Emphasis should be placed on MR
enterography (MRE) and IUS, depending on local availability
and expertise, as they do not expose patients to ionising radi-
ation. For diagnosis and determining disease extent, MRI is
preferred as first line. The use of cross- sectional abdominal
imaging and IUS should be prioritised in the diagnosis and
assessment of strictures, as well as the use of ileocolonoscopy
in colonic and anastomotic strictures when clinically safe to
perform, with biopsies to exclude dysplasia and aid distinc-
tion of fibrotic from inflammatory strictures.

 ► An  oesophagogastroduodenoscopy  may  be  warranted  in
patients  experiencing  upper  gastrointestinal  symptoms,
but  it  is  otherwise  not  routinely  needed  for  assessment  of
Crohn’s disease.

 ► In  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease,  withdrawal  of  purine
analogues, or anti- TNF therapy, when used as monotherapy
or combination therapy, is associated with a significant risk
of  relapse.  Shared  decision- making  should  be  undertaken
before withdrawal.

 ► There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend routine
use  of  exclusive  enteral  nutrition  (EEN)  in  Crohn’s  disease.
Preoperative  EEN  can  be  considered  in  undernourished
patients with fibrotic or penetrating Crohn’s disease (Table 2).

Perianal Crohn’s disease
 ► Modalities for assessment of perianal Crohn’s disease include
clinical  assessment,  pelvic  MRI  scan  and  examination  under
anaesthesia, by a colorectal surgeon experienced in evaluation
of  fistulising  perianal  Crohn’s  disease.  Depending  on  local
availability and expertise, endoanal ultrasound may have a role.
 ► Endoscopic  assessment  of  the  rectal  mucosa  should  be

undertaken.

 ► Patients  with  perianal  Crohn’s  disease  should  be  managed

via the IBD MDT.

 ► Setons should be placed to prevent sepsis in fistulising peri-
anal Crohn’s disease. The optimal timing of seton removal
is  uncertain,  factoring  patient  preferences,  and  complexity
of the fistulae.

 ► Surgical  repair,  such  as  advancement  flap,  and  ligation  of
intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT), may be considered for
selected patients in a multidisciplinary setting.

 ► Patients  with  severe  perianal  Crohn’s  disease  refractory
to  medical  therapy  and  affecting  quality  of  life  should  be
offered  faecal  stream  diversion  surgery.  Patients  should

Moran GW, et al. Gut 2025;74:s1–s101. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2024-334395




























Guidelines

be  counselled  and  informed  that  the  rates  of  subsequent
successful reversal are low, and proctectomy may ultimately
be required.

 ► Medical therapies should be started promptly after adequate

surgical drainage of perianal abscesses.

 ► Infliximab  is  recommended  as  first- line  advanced  therapy

for perianal Crohn’s disease.

 ► Patients  with  inadequate  response  to  infliximab  may  be

offered other advanced therapies.

Surgical considerations for luminal Crohn’s disease
 ► A  laparoscopic  resection  should  be  considered  in  localised
ileocaecal Crohn’s disease in patients not responding to, or

relapsing after, initial medical therapy, or in those preferring
surgery rather than initiation or continuation of drug therapy.
 ► Following  ileocaecal  resection,  early  maintenance  medical
therapy  should  be  considered  in  people  with  high- risk
features, or those with a personal preference for early main-
tenance therapy, as part of shared decision- making.

 ► Assessment  of  Crohn’s  disease  activity  to  guide  medical
therapy should be performed 6 months after surgery, prefer-
ably with ileocolonoscopy.

 ► Patients with stricturing small bowel Crohn’s disease should
have  joint  medical  and  surgical  assessment  to  optimise
medical therapy and plan requirement for surgical resection
or strictureplasty.

 ► A  strictureplasty  is  an  alternative  to  resection  in  patients
with small bowel Crohn’s disease strictures shorter than 10
cm,  and  is  useful  where  there  are  multiple  strictures  or  a
need to preserve gut length. Longer strictures can be treated
using non- standard strictureplasty techniques.

 ► Endoscopic  balloon  dilatation  is  an  appropriate  treatment
for  ileocolonic  anastomotic  strictures  less  than  4  cm  in
length, without sharp angulation, and with non- penetrating
disease.  Repeated  dilatation  is  often  required.  Endoscopi-
cally accessible ileal strictures are also amenable to balloon
dilatation,  but  complication  rates  and  recurrence  rates  are
higher. There is no role for intralesional corticosteroid injec-
tion at the time of stricture dilatation. Long- term data on the
impact of dilatation on surgical resections are lacking.

 ► Intra- abdominal  abscesses  should  be  treated  by  antibiotics
and, if possible, radiologically guided percutaneous drainage
should be performed.

 ► Following treatment of an abdominal abscess in the setting
of non- perianal fistulising Crohn’s disease, joint medical and
surgical discussion is required, but interval surgical resection
is not always necessary.

INTRODUCTION
In the past 5 years, there have been several advancements in the
management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). To this effect,
the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Clinical Services
and Standards Committee (CSSC) have commissioned the BSG
IBD section to develop a new guideline for the management of
IBD. The aim of this document is to update the most recent guide-
line published in 2019. This guideline should be used in conjunc-
tion  with  the  IBD  standards  in  a  complementary  fashion.1  We
would also encourage the use of the national primary care diag-
nostic pathway for lower gastrointestinal symptoms to improve
diagnosis  in  a  timely  manner  (https://www. whatsupwithmygut.
org. uk) for IBD.

This  guideline  contains  the  official  recommendations  of  the
BSG on all aspects of IBD care. This set of procedures has been
approved by the CSSC and the BSG executive board. No funding
has  been  received  from  any  outside  organisation,  commercial
or  otherwise,  for  the  production  of  this  document,  with  some
support provided for members’ time as part of their employment
at public higher educational institutions or within their roles as
National Health Service (NHS) funded health professionals.

While primarily designed for use within the UK, the guideline
will be useful for professionals and patients in many areas world-
wide  and  therefore  is  presented  in  a  full  systematic  and  trans-
parent fashion. The prospective publishing of this document is
part of that process of systematic guideline production.

These  BSG  guidelines  represent  a  consensus  of  best  practice
based on the available evidence at the time of preparation. They
may  not  apply  in  all  situations  and  should  be  interpreted  in
the light of specific clinical situations and resource availability.
Further  controlled  clinical  studies  may  be  needed  to  clarify
aspects  of  these  statements,  and  revision  may  be  necessary  as
new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of
action  at  variance  to  these  recommendations,  but  we  suggest
that reasons for this are documented in the medical record. BSG
guidelines are intended to be an educational device to provide
information that may assist in providing care to patients. They
are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal
standard  of  care  or  as  encouraging,  advocating,  requiring  or
discouraging any particular treatment.

Guidelines

METHODS
The  methods  have  been  changed  substantially  since  the  previ-
ously  published  guideline  to  reflect  current  best  practice  in  all
aspects of technical review and guideline production. The meth-
odology and operating procedures for this guideline were devel-
oped  and  prospectively  agreed,  then  published  independently
in  full  after  peer  review.2  All  the  approaches  followed  are  in
line  with  best  practice  but  may  represent  a  substantial  shift  in
approach and presentation for stakeholders using the guideline.
While it is outside of the scope of this guideline to review the
previously published operating procedures and methods,2 there
are a few key points that will be of use to the user:
 ► This is an update guideline and so the focus on searches for
evidence was for new output in the last 7 years since the last
guideline searches were completed and, where appropriate,
combining  these  with  existing  evidence  from  the  previous
guideline.

 ► Systematic  reviews  of  randomised  trials  (updated  and
meeting high methods standards) and randomised controlled
trials  were  included  for  efficacy  outcomes.  Observational
studies  were  included  for  safety  outcomes,  although  these
were also appraised using appropriate tools.

 ► Network  meta- analyses  were  completed  for  this  guideline
for key induction and remission areas of study. These find-
ings were not used to supersede individual or meta- analysis
findings,  but  to  triangulate  them  with  another  source
of  evidence.  The  most  up  to  date  methods  were  used  for
Grading  of  Recommendations  Assessment,  Development
and  Evaluation  (GRADE)  analysis  of  networks  and,  as
such, these were created exclusively for the guideline as no
published equivalent existed.

 ► GRADE  methods  were  used,  and  this  encompasses  two
separate but symbiotically linked elements: (1) assessing the
certainty  of  evidence  for  each  outcome  in  a  comparison,
(2) defining the strength of recommendations made on the
overall evidence base.

 ► These two elements inform each other but are not directly
correlated. There are numerous examples where the certainty
of  evidence  is  low,  because  of  other  factors  (cost,  accepta-
bility,  strong  clinician  practical  experience,  safety),  but  a
strong  recommendation  can  still  be  made.  The  opposite  is
also true, especially in the context of juxtaposed outcomes,
such as when a therapy may be effective, but safety concerns
prevent a recommendation for its use.

 ► The  magnitude  of  effects  in  absolute  terms  are  used
throughout  the  decision- making  process.  They  supported
judgements  on  precision  of  estimates  and  therefore  their
certainty.  They  were  also  used  to  judge  the  significance
of  the  outcomes  seen  against  pre- agreed  thresholds.  Such
thresholds have been used before in IBD guidelines but often
with a single dichotomous level (eg, less than 10% is trivial,
more is a significant difference).3 In this guideline, an ordinal
scale of magnitudes was used as this supports more nuanced
understanding  of  precision  and  comparison  of  therapies.
Further details surrounding this have been published in full.3
Of particular note from this recent publication3 is the trian-
gulation of the thresholds of the UK based guidelines devel-
opment  group  (GDG)  with  international  colleagues,  and
this found little difference, suggesting face validity of these
judgements.

 ► GRADE  recommendations  should  be  considered  in  the
context of table 3, which clarifies the prespecified and stand-
ardised  GRADE  language.  This  may  be  particularly  novel

to the reader as this has not been applied in such a fashion
within previous IBD guidelines. It is therefore important to
remember that the language used has not been devised ad hoc
and is informed by the key factors—namely, the effectiveness
and  safety  of  interventions,  the  certainty  of  these  findings
and the magnitude of effects seen—in an objective manner.
There are clearly opportunities where borderline or complex
decisions on such recommendations could be challenged, but
the use of language is consistent with these decisions.

 ► It may be initially unusual to see key therapies recommended
‘conditionally’.  This  does  not  mean  they  are  ineffective  or
should not be used. In line with the GRADE approach and
language guidance discussed, this is a reflection of the like-
lihood  that  future  research  may  change  the  current  find-
ings.  A  change  does  not  mean  that  an  effective  treatment
is  ineffective  (or  vice  versa),  instead,  it  may  simply  mean
that  the  certainty  of  evidence  may  change  with  further
research, owing to increased quality, reduced inconsistency
and increased precision. From this perspective, it is clear that
many (if not most) therapies have the potential to be condi-
tional as we constantly evolve the evidence base and increase
the quality and precision of findings.

 ► GRADE recommendations are supplemented by Good Practice
Statements (GPS). In line with best international practice, such
statements are only made when there are strong sources of non-
traditional  evidence  (expert  knowledge  and  eminent  experi-
ence, patient voices, observational bodies of evidence) or when
standard studies would simply not be feasible. GPS must be of
a  substantial  net  benefit  to  the  user.  As  such,  the  GDG  does
not suggest that GRADE recommendations are more truthful
or  important  than  GPS  statements.  The  novel  approach  of
this  guideline  is  to  present  both,  transparently  displaying  the
rationale for the different approaches, but acknowledging the
importance of both groups of guidance to the field.

It is suggested that for more information the detailed supple-
mentary appendices and published methods2 are consulted, but
it is hoped this summary will orientate readers.

RESULTS
A  total  of  89  clinical  experts/stakeholders  participated  in  this
online  survey.  Clinical  remission,  clinical  response,  endoscopic
remission, withdrawal due to adverse events and serious adverse
events  were  considered  critical  (primary)  outcomes.  Trivial  to
small, small to moderate and moderate to large thresholds were
agreed3 and are presented in figure 1.

Presentation of statements
Three categories of statement are presented in this guideline.

GRADE recommendations are presented where evidence was
sufficient  and  the  GDG  were  able  to  make  such  recommenda-
tions  for  practice.  A  standardised  approach  to  presentation
has  been  developed.  This  adopts  clear  and  consistent  GRADE
language, includes core data from the evidence to decision frame-
works that present the balance of risks and benefits, displays all
individual and overall GRADE certainty levels of evidence, and
finally, presents magnitude in relative, absolute and visual terms
(with the use of Cates plots). The approach is described in full in
our published protocol,2 but a summary citing the grade hand-
book4 can be seen in table 3.

Figure  1  presents  an  annotated  model  of  this  approach,  as
well  as  a  summary  of  the  agreed  thresholds  used  and  GRADE
explanation.  This  should  guide  interpretation  and  use  of  the
GRADE recommendations for readers. The details of the agreed

Guidelines

thresholds for magnitude of effects are included for quick refer-
ence.3 For practical and readability reasons, these have been split
in the final manuscript. The main GRADE recommendation and
explanation  are  included  in  the  text.  Tables  summarising  the
findings are included in the supplementary material.

Readers  will  note  the  inclusion  of  Cates  plots  within  the
supplementary appendices to visually show the impact of ther-
apies.  These  were  reported  over  20  years  ago,5  but  have  been
refined, and for this manuscript were produced using an online
resource with specific amendments to aid and support interpre-
tation  of  the  Cates  plots.  A  red  face  indicates  that  there  is  no
change in risk. So, in the context of a treatment, this will mean
no  change  in  clinical  state  (not  necessarily  any  worsening,  but
no response). The pale grey/green faces demonstrate therapeutic
successes that would occur with a placebo intervention (without
active treatment). The bright green faces are additional successes
that would occur if treatment was used.

Good practice statements (GPS) are clear and actionable and

made when they are necessary to include in IBD practice. The
presentation and wider use of the statements must be likely to
lead  to  large  net  consequences.  They  are  informed  by  several
bodies of linked indirect evidence.

The  final  form  of  statement  is  expert  opinion.  These  are
presented within the wider narrative of the review and all guid-
ance, information and discussion within the guideline that does
not  fall  into  the  first  two  categories  should  be  considered  as
expert opinion. These are reflective of the consensus view of the
GDG (online supplemental appendix 1).

Decision-making
The  approach  to  decision- making  is  aligned  with  the  various
methods  cited  and  represents  a  shift  from  previous  and  other
international  guideline  approaches.  A  cyclical  process  was
followed.

Individual  authors  gathered  the  evidence,  including  that
within  evidence  to  decision  frameworks,  where  appropriate.
Initial  draft  recommendations  or  statements  were  made.  GPS
were  reviewed  by  the  GDG  subgroup  of  relevant  stakeholder
and content experts, and then the wider group. Formal voting
was  not  performed  and  instead  changes  made  in  an  iterative
fashion based on feedback.

For GRADE recommendations, the same approach was taken.
The  final  recommendations  were  discussed  at  a  2- day  face  to
face  summit  attended  by  over  75%  of  the  GDG  in  November
2023.  Two  additional  statements  were  discussed  and  voted  on
later  (14  August  2024);  these  are  appropriately  marked  in  the
table.

A strong recommendation is one for which the
guideline panel is confident that the desirable
effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable
effects or that the undesirable effects of an
intervention outweigh its desirable effects

No clinical practice guideline or recommendation
can take into account all of the often- compelling
unique features of individual patients and clinical
circumstances. Thus, strong recommendations may
not be applicable for some patients

A conditional recommendation is one for which the
desirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable
effects, or undesirable effects probably outweigh
the desirable effects, but appreciable uncertainty
exists. The justification and implementation
considerations will give details

Given the element of doubt within such statements,
reflecting the primary evidence and magnitude data,
considerable latitude exists (whether supporting
or refuting use of therapy) and individual patient,
resource and other contextual factors must be
considered Clinicians, patients, third- party payers,
institutional review committees, other stakeholders
or the courts should not interpret these
recommendations as mandatory

The available evidence provides a high level of

Tofacitinib is better than placebo at the maintenance

The available evidence is sufficient to support a
conclusion, but further research may still affect
confidence in the result or the result itself

Tofacitinib is probably better than placebo for the
induction of clinical response in ulcerative colitis
(moderate certainty)

The available evidence is limited, and the true effect
may be substantially different from the estimate so
may change in the future

Infliximab may be more effective than placebo at
week 4 for the induction of clinical remission (NNTB
3, low certainty)

The available evidence is insufficient to support any
firm conclusions and any result seen should not be
employed and the true effect treated as unclear

The evidence is very uncertain for induction of
clinical remission using methotrexate in Crohn’s
disease (very low certainty)

DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING
Investigations to assess ulcerative colitis
Diagnosis and classification
Diagnosis of ulcerative colitis relies on a combination of clinical
history, non- invasive biomarkers of inflammation and colonos-
copy with histology. Clinical history and non- invasive biomarkers
such as CRP and faecal calprotectin are useful adjuncts to colo-
noscopy  in  diagnosing  ulcerative  colitis.  Patients  presenting  to
primary  or  secondary  care  with  a  suggestive  history  should  be
initially assessed with a full panel of blood tests, including a full
blood count, CRP, albumin and stool samples, to exclude infec-
tion and for faecal calprotectin. Faecal biomarkers, in particular
calprotectin and lactoferrin, are released by gut neutrophils and
have excellent sensitivity in diagnosing IBD but have poor spec-
ificity.6 However, infections and drugs are other common causes
of raised faecal biomarkers, which should be considered.7 Ulti-
mately, the diagnosis rests on endoscopic evaluation and histo-
logical assessment.

In  patients  presenting  with  acute  severe  colitis  as  their
first  manifestation  of  ulcerative  colitis,  an  unprepared  flex-
ible  sigmoidoscopy  during  the  acute  phase,  with  a  subsequent

planned colonoscopy for assessment of disease extent, is recom-
mended. Non- invasive imaging, like an abdominal X- ray, CT or
ultrasound examination, could be used to define disease extent
and complications.

The  Montreal  classification8  in  adults,  and  the  Paris  clas-
sification9  in  children,  are  useful  in  ascribing  phenotypes  to
patients both for treatment and to assist with service delivery
and research.10 Children developing IBD generally have more
extensive  disease  than  adults.11  Establishing  the  extent  of  the
inflammation  in  a  patient  with  ulcerative  colitis  is  important
for  prognosis  as  the  likelihood  of  colectomy  is  dependent  on
disease  extent.  A  systematic  review  showed  for  those  with
extensive colitis, a 19% 10- year colectomy rate , 8% for left-
sided colitis and 5% for proctitis; backwash ileitis is also associ-
ated with more aggressive disease, and with primary sclerosing
cholangitis.12

Those  with  extensive  colitis  also  have  the  highest  risk  of
developing  colorectal  cancer.13  14  Disease  extent  can  change
after  diagnosis.15  Up  to  half  with  proctitis  or  proctosigmoid-
itis will develop more extensive disease.16–18 Of patients with
proctitis initially, 10% will ultimately have extensive colitis.19
However,  over  time  the  extent  of  inflammation  can  also
regress, and classification should always remain as the maximal
extent.15

Endoscopic  appearance  may  significantly  underestimate  the
true extent (particularly in quiescent ulcerative colitis), and this
should  be  confirmed  by  segmental  biopsies.  The  Mayo  Score
for ulcerative colitis is widely used in clinical trials and may be
applied to clinical practice as a composite clinical and endoscopic
tool.20 The score of 0–12 includes a measure of stool frequency,

rectal bleeding, a physician’s global assessment and a measure of
mucosal inflammation at endoscopy. The partial Mayo score uses
the non- invasive components of the full score and correlates well
with patient perceptions of response to therapy.21 There is wide
variation  in  interpretation  of  disease  activity  endoscopically.22
The  Ulcerative  Colitis  Endoscopic  Index  of  Severity  (UCEIS)
has  been  developed  to  improve  reliability.23  24  The  Modified
Mayo  Endoscopic  Score  (MES)  is  another  simple  measure  of
 endoscopic activity that correlates well with clinical and biolog-
ical activity (table 4).25 Although both have been extensively vali-
dated, interobserver variation remains a significant limitation of
these visual scores.26 27

Symptomatic  and  endoscopic  scores  may  be  limited  by  their
ability  to  quantify  accurately  the  impact  of  disease  on  quality
of  life,  including  fatigue  and  psychosocial  function;  however,
if made more complex the indices may be difficult to apply to
clinical practice.28 29 An increasing emphasis on patient- reported
outcome  measures  (PROMs:  standardised  questionnaires  filled
out  by  patients  without  clinician  involvement)  in  clinical  trials
may translate to routine clinical practice.30

Monitoring remission in ulcerative colitis

GPS 3

We recommend a multimodal approach to monitoring of
remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. Patients should
be assessed with a clinical index, such as the partial Mayo or
Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index, in addition to haemoglobin,
C- reactive protein, faecal calprotectin or, if available, intestinal
ultrasound and ideally colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy with
histology. The combination of modalities and frequency of
monitoring appointments depends on therapy, duration of
remission and local availability of resources.

Clear  monitoring  strategies  in  ulcerative  colitis  are  essential,
not only to confirm remission, but also to detect complications
of  therapy.  Monitoring  appointments  also  provide  opportu-
nity  to  confirm  adherence  to  cancer  prevention  surveillance
programmes  reference  the  surveillance  guidelines  and  to  eval-
uate extraintestinal manifestations and vaccination uptake.

Treatment targets in ulcerative colitis have evolved from tradi-
tional  clinical  remission  to  include  endoscopic  and  laboratory-
assessed  remission.  While  there  is  evidence  to  support  an
association  between  mucosal  healing  and  long- term  clinical
remission,  confirmation  of  these  parameters  with  colonoscopy
is  typically  expensive  and  less  accepted  by  patients  than  alter-
natives,  such  as  blood  or  stool- based  biomarkers,  or  intestinal
ultrasound.7  Resource  availability  may  also  shape781  preferred
strategy, with the increasing ultrasound availability making this a
possible strategy in the UK. Furthermore, monitoring strategies
in IBD run alongside colorectal cancer surveillance programmes,
such  that,  all  patients  with  IBD  affecting  the  colon  should
have  a  colonoscopy  8  years  after  symptoms,  and  those  with
pancolitis will undergo regular colonoscopy (for specific details
of IBD surveillance please see related BSG guidance). While the
primary aim is dysplasia detection, it also serves as opportunity
to confirm endoscopic remission and disease extent. Colorectal
cancer surveillance should be undertaken when the patient is in
remission.

The risk of relapse or treatment complication varies consider-
ably between patients, requiring different monitoring strategies

Guidelines

depending  on  disease  phenotype,  duration  of  remission,  age,
frailty and current therapy. Although there is evidence to support
multimodal disease assessment in ulcerative colitis, there is a lack
of  direct  comparisons  between  modalities.  Below,  we  outline
clinical  scoring  systems  in  ulcerative  colitis,  then  discuss  the
correlation  of  faecal  calprotectin,  CRP,  anaemia  and  intestinal
ultrasound  with  endoscopic  and  histological  scoring  systems.
Thereafter, we propose a multimodal approach to monitoring of
patients in clinical remission.

Clinical scoring systems to monitor remission in ulcerative colitis
Clinical scoring systems in ulcerative colitis are useful for system-
atically  assessing  disease  activity,  although  they  are  still  open
to a degree of subjectivity. The partial Mayo score and Simple
Clinical Colitis Activity Index are commonly used instruments,31
although there is no validated comparison between these. Within
the  many  PROMs,  PRO- 2  is  widely  used  in  clinical  trials,  and
yet  not  widely  adopted  in  clinical  practice.  Clinical  indices  do
not always correlate with active inflammation.32 However, they
serve to guide clinicians in providing a degree of standardisation
in the assessment and documentation of symptoms.

Faecal calprotectin in monitoring of remission in ulcerative colitis
Faecal calprotectin correlates well with clinical, endoscopic and
histological disease activity in ulcerative colitis,33 and is thereby
of  value  for  monitoring  the  clinically  stable  patient.  However,
determining a specific target to trigger further disease assessment
is more challenging, with variability regarding patient treatment
targets and change from baseline.

Cortesi et al identified that a faecal calprotectin target of <100
μg/g was associated with a lower probability of clinical relapse.33
Indeed, several studies have associated faecal calprotectin with
endoscopic  activity,  although  cut- off  values  and  definitions  of
endoscopic  remission  or  healing  vary.  Dulai  et  al  established
faecal calprotectin of <250 μg/g (compared with >250 μg/g) to
be  associated  with  endoscopic  and  histological  remission,  and
protective against hospital admission or colectomy.34 Likewise,
Walsh  et  al  demonstrated  a  tight  correlation  between  faecal
calprotectin and endoscopic activity as measured by UCEIS, with
a  threshold  of  187  μg/g  predictive  of  active  disease.35  Others
showed faecal calprotectin thresholds predictive of endoscopic
remission  to  be  dependent  on  the  scoring  index  used,  with
cut  off  values  of  112,  148  and  161  μg/g  predictive  of  activity
using  Mayo  endoscopic  score,  UCEIS  and  modified  PICaSSO,
respectively.36  Similarly,  values  correlating  with  histological
remission  also  vary  between  studies  and  scoring  systems,  with
cut- off  values  between  75  μg/g  and  100  μg/g  identified  within
the literature.35–37

Taking  this  information  into  account,  a  pragmatic  approach
may be to consider patients with faecal calprotectin <100 μg/g
likely to be in endoscopic remission, faecal calprotectin 100–200
μg/g to have intermediate probability of endoscopic remission,
and those with faecal calprotectin of >200 μg/g to have a low
likelihood of endoscopic remission. Subsequent action depends
on the patient disease phenotype and treatment history, with a
general  principle  of  advocating  endoscopic  evaluation  before
significant  changes  to  therapy  are  made  wherever  the  clinical
setting and service capacity allow.

We advocate that faecal calprotectin >200 μg/g should trigger
a  discussion  about  lower  gastrointestinal  endoscopy.  Values  of
100–200 μg/g in an otherwise well patient, should prompt a test
within a reasonable time frame (with further increase indicative

of impending clinical relapse, and triggering discussion of endo-
scopic assessment).

Interpretation of blood parameters in monitoring of remission in
ulcerative colitis
Monitoring  blood  tests  assess  the  safety  of  medications,  espe-
cially  in  patients  who  have  achieved  remission  with  advanced
therapies  or  immunomodulators.  However,  acute  phase  reac-
tants may also serve as surrogate markers of subclinical disease
activity,  with  blood  tests  as  a  convenient  option  in  the  outpa-
tient  setting.  CRP  is  a  marker  of  disease  activity  in  ulcerative
colitis, although one which correlates less tightly with activity
than faecal calprotectin.38 Indeed, it is recognised patients may
have completely normal CRP even during a disease flare, thus
rendering  the  negative  predictive  value  low.38  However,  an
elevated  CRP,  above  that  of  laboratory  reference  range,  may
be suggestive of active disease. As faecal calprotectin is a more
sensitive and specific biomarker, we suggest that patients with
an  unexpectedly  raised  CRP  and  no  localising  symptoms  or
signs to suggest an alternative cause, should have faecal calpro-
tectin measured to validate biochemical disease activity before
arranging  endoscopic  evaluation,  in  the  absence  of  clinical
symptoms.

Anaemia and disease activity in UC
Anaemia  in  IBD  is  covered  in  section  8.4.3.  The  two  most
common  causes  of  anaemia  in  IBD  are  iron  deficiency  and
anaemia of chronic disease, both of which may reflect subclin-
ical  disease  activity  in  patients  in  clinical  remission.39  In  the
absence of an alternative cause for anaemia, such as menorrhagia
or coeliac disease, disease activity should be further assessed. As
with  interpretation  of  CRP,  when  managing  anaemic  patients
in  clinical  remission  it  would  be  reasonable  to  consider  faecal
calprotectin  as  a  surrogate  of  endoscopic  activity  in  the  first
instance, deferring endoscopic evaluation for those with refrac-
tory anaemia or those with raised faecal calprotectin.

Colonic ultrasound in monitoring of remission in ulcerative colitis
Intestinal  ultrasound  (IUS)  is  increasingly  recognised  as
a  useful  tool  for  monitoring  disease  activity  in  ulcerative
colitis.40 In the era of ‘treat to target’, endoscopic remission
and response are frequently selected targets due to their asso-
ciation  with  long- term  clinical  response.  However,  colonos-
copy is invasive and not always well tolerated by patients. By
contrast,  intestinal  ultrasound  is  well  tolerated,  requires  no
bowel preparation and has the potential to provide real time
information  about  disease  extent  and  severity  in  the  outpa-
tient setting.7 41

There are currently two scoring systems used to quantify and
standardise  results  of  IUS  of  the  colon;  the  Milan  Ultrasound
Criteria (MUC)7 and the Ulcerative Colitis Intestinal Ultrasound
Index  (UC- IUS).42  Both  show  strong  correlation  with  endo-
scopic  disease  activity.  The  UC- IUS  integrates  the  parameters
of bowel wall thickness, Doppler signal, abnormal haustrations
and fat wrapping, and demonstrates strong correlation with both
the endoscopic Mayo score (ρ = 0.830; p < 0.001),40 and the
UCEIS index (ρ = 0.759; p < 0.001).42 The MUC is calculated
from bowel wall thickness (BWT) and bowel wall flow. MUC also
correlates highly with endoscopic improvement, with MUC<6.2
predictive  of  endoscopic  response  and  MUC<4.3  predictive
of  endoscopic  remission.40  MUC  with  faecal  calprotectin  also

correlates  with  the  Nancy  Histological  Index,  thus  demon-
strating  preliminary  evidence  that  the  two  modalities  may  be
used to infer histological response or remission.43

Point of care ultrasound is not often available in the gastro-
enterology  outpatient  setting  in  the  UK,  and  there  is  currently
patchy provision of IUS by radiology departments.44 However,
it is included in this section on monitoring, as we felt that it was
important to provide guidance based on evidence, as opposed to
current resource availability.

Clinical diagnosis of Crohn’s disease
Classification of Crohn’s disease
The  first  classification  for  Crohn’s  disease  issued  in  1991  by
the  International  Working  Party,  was  based  on  anatomical
distribution, surgical history and clinical behaviour, including
inflammatory, fistulising or stenotic disease.45 This was refined
as the Vienna classification in 1998 to include age of onset (A),
disease location (L) and disease behaviour (B) as the predom-
inant  phenotypic  elements.46  The  Montreal  revision  of  the
Vienna classification further refined each of the three subclas-
sifications  (table  4).15  Specifically,  the  Montreal  classification
added early onset of disease with age of diagnosis at 16 years
or  younger.  The  major  limitation  of  the  Vienna  classification
was  the  mutual  exclusivity  between  upper  gastrointestinal
disease and more distal disease, whereas in the Montreal clas-
sification upper gastrointestinal disease can coexist with more
distal  disease.  The  last  modification  was  to  include  perianal
disease  as  a  separate  entity  from  intestinal  fistulising  disease.
The Montreal Working Party addressed these aspects of clinical
definition  and  classification,  for  the  purposes  of  adoption  in
clinical practice, and to support future genetic and serological
studies.

The Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was developed
and  validated  in  197647  48  as  a  tool  to  assess  the  severity  of
inflammatory disease. A multivariable regression analysis was
used to develop an equation that best predicted the investiga-
tors’ overall rating for each patient, with eight variables that
determine the final score: number of liquid stools, the extent
of  abdominal  pain,  general  well- being,  the  occurrence  of
extraintestinal  symptoms,  the  need  for  antidiarrhoeal  drugs,
the  presence  of  abdominal  masses,  haematocrit  and  body

weight.  Scores  range  from  0  to  600,  with  quiescent  disease
demonstrating a score of <150, mildly active disease between
150 and 219, moderately active disease between 220 and 450
and very severe disease of  >450 points. The CDAI (table 5)
is the most widely used measure of disease activity in clinical
trials, allowing for standardised approaches to data collection,
patient inclusion criteria, trial management decisions, and is a
principal response measure.49 However, the use of the CDAI in
routine clinical practice is limited by interoperator variability,
cumbersome calculation, the subjective perception of ‘general
well- being’  and  ‘abdominal  pain’,  the  heavily  weighted  diar-
rhoeal  symptoms  and  the  difficulty  in  maintaining  a  7- day
symptom  diary.50  Moreover,  this  index  is  not  applicable  for
patients  with  stomas,  is  not  validated  for  postoperative  use
and  may  underestimate  symptoms  and  effects  of  fistulising
disease.51

The Harvey- Bradshaw Index (HBI) was created to simplify the
CDAI by using only a single day’s reading for diary entries and
excluding  three  variables—namely,  the  use  of  anti- diarrhoeal

medications, haematocrit and body weight47 (table 6). It is also
more  operator  friendly  by  summing  values  of  variables  rather
than applying weighted coefficients. Some studies have demon-
strated the precision of HBI to be less than CDAI in correlating
with objective markers of inflammation.52 53 Thus, while the HBI
is considered adequate for the use in routine clinical practice, the
CDAI is still recommended for the continued use in prospective
clinical trials. It should be noted that neither the CDAI nor HBI
use  laboratory  values,  such  as  CRP,  endoscopic  or  histological
parameters  to  indicate  active  inflammation,  and  neither  incor-
porates faecal calprotectin.

In  recent  years,  several  questionnaires  have  been  developed,
recognising  that  patient- reported  outcomes  (PROs)  represent
an  important  endpoint  and  major  therapeutic  goal  of  IBD.  To
improve  objectivity  and  performance,  studies  conducted  in
Crohn’s disease investigated a two- item PRO (PRO- 2), with stool
frequency and abdominal pain as the main objective measures of
disease activity. Further review of all PROs is beyond the scope
of this guideline.

Clinical assessments in Crohn’s disease

GPS 4

We recommend assessment of disease activity when a relapse
of Crohn’s disease is suspected using clinical, biochemical,
cross- sectional abdominal imaging, intestinal ultrasound,
capsule endoscopy and/or ileo- colonoscopy, personalised to the
individual’s disease phenotype and location, taking into account
the urgency, availability and tolerability of tests.

Guidelines

Several  imaging  modalities  can  be  used  in  the  diagnosis  and
monitoring  of  Crohn’s  disease,  each  with  strengths  and  draw-
backs.  Previous  BSG  guidance  addressed  the  decline  in  use  of
luminal barium fluoroscopic techniques for diagnosis and their
replacement  with  cross- sectional  imaging  such  as  CT  enterog-
raphy  (CTE)  and  magnetic  resonance  enterography  (MRE),  as
well as IUS.

Primary  considerations  in  the  choice  of  imaging  modality
are  diagnostic  accuracy,  sensitivity,  and  specificity,  as  well  as
minimising  exposure  to  ionising  radiation  and  acceptability  to
patients. In addition, imaging choice will largely be determined
by the local expertise and availability of tests, the specific clin-
ical  question,  as  well  as  patient  presentation  (stable  outpatient
setting vs emergency admission), which may also be a significant
factor in the initial imaging modality.

Faecal calprotectin

GPS 5

Faecal calprotectin should be used to monitor disease in patients
with known Crohn’s disease in a known location, where there is
a baseline faecal calprotectin value.

Faecal calprotectin is a reliable indicator of remission in Crohn’s
disease, indicated by mucosal healing,54 and is sensitive enough
to  distinguish  between  mild,  moderate  and  severe  disease
activity.55  However,  there  is  considerable  disagreement  in  the
cut- off values in Crohn’s disease,56–58 which may also be depen-
dent  on  disease  location.57  The  sensitivities  and  specificities
of  faecal  calprotectin  to  accurately  measure  disease  activity  in
Crohn’s  disease  at  different  disease  locations  are  diverse,  and
no firm conclusion can be drawn59; however, it may be less reli-
able in small bowel disease than in colonic Crohn’s disease.60 61
Changes in an individual’s faecal calprotectin over time may be
more meaningful than absolute numbers.62 63

Ileo-colonoscopy

GPS 6

We recommend that ileo- colonoscopy, when Crohn’s disease
is suspected and the procedure is clinically safe to perform,
should include ileo- colonic biopsies and standardised endoscopic
scoring systems to assist in defining the severity and aetiology of
macroscopic and microscopic inflammation.

Ileo- colonoscopy  remains  the  first- line  investigation  to  diag-
nose Crohn’s disease since it allows for an assessment of disease
extent, and importantly, the collection of biopsy specimens for
a  histological  diagnosis.64  This  is  particularly  important  at  the
index presentation prior to the initiation of medical therapy and
is supported by the ECCO- ESGAR guidelines of 201965 and by
the  European  Society  of  Gastrointestinal  Endoscopy  (ESGE)
guidelines  for  the  diagnosis  of  small  bowel  disorders.66  The
importance of histology to diagnose Crohn’s disease should not
be underestimated even in the era of advancing imaging modali-
ties, such as cross- sectional imaging, IUS and capsule endoscopy,
especially to differentiate Crohn's disease from infective, drug-
induced, ischaemic aetiologies of enterocolitis and small bowel
lymphoma.

Small bowel capsule endoscopy

GPS 7

We suggest performing small bowel capsule endoscopy when
small bowel Crohn’s disease is suspected despite normal or
inconclusive investigations.

Video capsule endoscopy provides endoluminal images of the GI
tract, most valuable to examine the small bowel, where conven-
tional  endoscopy  access  is  limited.  Presently,  neither  upper  GI
endoscopy nor colon capsule endoscopy are recommended for
the  routine  diagnosis  of  Crohn’s  disease,  although  pan- enteric
capsules have shown equivalent diagnostic yield compared with
ileo- colonoscopy  and  MRE.67  The  ESGE  recommends  ileo-
colonoscopy  as  first- line  investigation  for  suspected  Crohn’s
disease,  and  small  bowel  capsule  endoscopy  (SBCE)  is  recom-
mended  as  the  initial  investigation  of  the  small  bowel  after  a
negative ileo- colonoscopy.66

GPS 8

We suggest the use of a patency capsule prior to capsule
endoscopy in those with suspected Crohn’s disease who have
obstructive symptoms.

In  two  published  meta- analyses,  SBCE  was  diagnostically
superior  to  barium  follow- through,  but  similar  to  CT  and
MRE.68  69  Both  meta- analyses  noted  SBCE  to  be  superior  to
MRE  for  more  proximal  and  superficial  lesions.  The  capsule
retention  rates  have  reduced  with  successive  meta- analysis
over  time,  with  higher  retention  rates  in  patients  with  estab-
lished versus suspected Crohn’s disease,70 an outcome that can
be  further  reduced  by  prior  use  of  patency  capsules.  Balloon-
assisted  enteroscopy  permits  the  entry  of  endoscopes  beyond
the  limits  of  conventional  gastroscopy,  push  enteroscopy  and
ileo- colonoscopy  relying  on  balloons  attached  to  the  enteros-
copy  devices.  Previously  published  systematic  reviews  suggest
similar diagnostic yields to SBCE71 and greater sensitivity than
MRE72  with  a  perforation  risk  of  0.15%  for  diagnostic  proce-
dures.73  ESGE  recommends  consideration  of  balloon- assisted
enteroscopy  to  obtain  biopsy  specimens  where  there  is  diag-
nostic uncertainty of Crohn’s disease, and where it might alter
the therapeutic approach.66

Cross-sectional imaging

GPS 9

Cross- sectional imaging, specifically MRI and CT, and IUS may
be used to evaluate both luminal and extraluminal Crohn’s
disease. Emphasis should be placed on MRE and IUS as they
do not expose patients to ionising radiation. For diagnosis
and determining disease extent, MRI is preferred as first line.
As MRE and IUS appear to be of similar value for monitoring
transmural healing in Crohn’s disease during treatment, the
choice of imaging modality depends on local availability and
expertise.

A  combined  approach  with  a  supportive  clinical  history,  raised
faecal  calprotectin,  together  with  locally  available  small  bowel
imaging  (CT,  MRE,  IUS  or  capsule  endoscopy)  and  ileo-
colonoscopy with histological sampling, will provide the necessary
information  to  diagnose  Crohn’s  disease.  Confirming  a  Crohn’s
disease diagnosis is critically important at the start of treatment.

The advantage of MRE and US over CTE is the lack of expo-
sure  to  radiation.  CT  scanning  exposes  patients  with  Crohn’s
disease to ionising radiation, which may increase their lifetime
risk  of  cancer,74–76  and  this  risk  is  particularly  important  for
children  and  young  adults.  Patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  have
more than twice the radiation exposure of patients with ulcer-
ative  colitis.  A  study  of  409  patients  from  a  tertiary  hospital
showed that 15.5% had a cumulative exposure dose in excess of
75 mSv75 (this dose is considered to increase the risk of cancer
mortality by 7.3%). Factors associated with excessive diagnostic
radiation  exposure  included  age  under  17  at  diagnosis,  upper
gastrointestinal  disease  location,  penetrating  disease,  need  for
intravenous  corticosteroids  and  more  than  one  surgical  opera-
tion for Crohn’s disease . Therefore, MRE and US are generally
preferred  over  CT  for  monitoring  of  Crohn’s  disease  to  limit
repeated  patient  exposure  to  ionising  radiation.  Generally,  the
role of CT is usually limited to acute presentations.

MRI is, however, not without limitations and considerations,
including  time,  availability,  patient  experience,  cost  and  avail-
able  expertise  in  reporting.77  Some  validated  and  reproducible
Crohn’s disease activity scoring systems have been developed to
standardise MRI assessment in Crohn’s disease, and STRIDE II
suggest using the Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity (MaRIA)
score to help define resolution of inflammation on MR imaging.
A simplified MaRIA score has also been developed and validated
in 2019 for easier and more time efficient assessment of Crohn’s
disease  activity  and  severity.78  Radiological  signs  of  disease
activity  include  increases  in  bowel  wall  thickness,  vascularity
and contrast enhancement, T2 and diffusion weighted imaging
signal (for MRE), reduced bowel motility and identification of
ulceration and acute extraluminal complications.

With respect to diagnostic accuracy, multiple meta- analyses79–81
failed to show any significant differences between MRE and IUS.
METRIC,  a  prospective  multicentre  UK- based  trial  in  2018,82
compared  MRE  with  US  in  284  patients  and  found  that  both
modalities  were  highly  accurate  for  detecting  small  bowel
Crohn’s  disease,  achieving  97%  sensitivity  for  MRE  and  92%
sensitivity  for  US.  MRE  had  significantly  higher  sensitivity  for
small bowel disease presence and location than US (80% vs 70%,
respectively), and greater specificity (95% vs 81%, respectively).
It is worth noting that US had superior sensitivity to that of MRE
for colonic disease presence in newly diagnosed patients (67% vs
47%, respectively). Diagnostic accuracy for abscess, fistulae and
stenosis  were  largely  equivalent  between  techniques,  although
MRE numerically found more fistulae and abscesses than US. US
may lack accuracy to diagnose deep pelvic pathology.

GPS 10

Cross- sectional imaging, specifically MRI and CT, and US may
be used to evaluate both luminal and extraluminal Crohn’s
disease. Emphasis should be placed on MRE and US as they
do not expose patients to ionising radiation. For diagnosis and
determining disease extent, MRI is preferred as first line. As MRE
and US appear to be of similar value for monitoring transmural
healing in Crohn’s disease during treatment, the choice of
modality depends on local availability and expertise.

Guidelines

Intestinal  US  is  increasingly  recognised  as  a  useful  tool  for
monitoring disease activity in IBD.83 However, the application
of  US  remains  limited  in  comparison  with  other  modalities
owing to lack of expertise and availability, and absence of vali-
dated indices, which needs to be addressed.84 The TRUST study
confirmed the utility of bowel US for monitoring disease activity
and response to treatment in Crohn’s disease. US, performed at
treatment initiation and at fixed time intervals showed improve-
ment of ultrasonographic parameters, including BWT, presence
of  mesenteric  lymph  nodes,  mesenteric  hypertrophy  and  stric-
tures.78 There may be a role for fluoroscopy on a case- by- case
basis  for  assessing  complex  anatomy,  enteric  fistulae  and  for
presurgical planning or defining complex postsurgical anatomy
and bowel length due to the dynamic nature of the study.

GPS 11

We suggest prioritising the use of cross- sectional abdominal
imaging and intestinal ultrasound in the diagnosis and
assessment of strictures, and recognising the role of ileo-
colonoscopy in colonic and anastomotic strictures when clinically
safe to perform, with biopsies to exclude dysplasia and aid
distinction of fibrotic from inflammatory strictures.

Monitoring remission in Crohn’s disease

GPS 12

We recommend a multimodal approach to monitoring of
remission in patients with Crohn’s disease. Patients should
be regularly assessed with a clinical index, such as PRO- 2,
in addition to blood monitoring, CRP, faecal calprotectin,
ileocolonoscopy and non- invasive imaging. The combination of
modalities and frequency of monitoring appointments depends
on disease phenotype, therapy and duration of remission.

Regular  disease  monitoring  for  Crohn’s  disease  in  remission
aims to confirm the state of remission, ensure adherence to, and
tolerance  of,  treatments,  review  nutritional  status,  extraintes-
tinal manifestations and vaccination uptake.

In  2015,  the  Selecting  Therapeutic  Targets  in  Inflammatory
Bowel  Disease  (STRIDE)  initiative,  defined  a  treat- to- target
approach for Crohn’s disease, with the aim of extending beyond
clinical  response  to  both  clinical  and  endoscopic  remission.6
The following targets were identified as most important: clinical
response and remission, endoscopic healing (EH), normalisation of
CRP/erythrocyte sedimentation rate and faecal calprotectin. Long-
term targets included clinical remission, EH, absence of disability
and  restoration  of  quality  of  life,  and  short- term  targets  were
symptomatic  relief  and  normalisation  of  biochemical  markers.
Transmural healing in Crohn’s disease did not emerge as a formal
target from STRIDE II, although the panel still recommended its
assessment through imaging as a measure of the remission depth.6
The approach to monitoring Crohn’s disease in remission will
inevitably depend on local resources. Moreover, frequency and
type of monitoring will depend on disease phenotype, manage-
ment and duration of remission.

Clinical scoring systems

mation and clinical symptoms, alongside the possibility of other

Guidelines

differential diagnoses (eg, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), bile salt
malabsorption, small bowel bacterial overgrowth) in IBD,85 makes
clinical indices alone insufficient to confirm disease activity.

Patient- reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly becoming
a standard tool for disease monitoring. The most used PRO in
adult Crohn’s disease is PRO- 2—that is, the average daily stool
frequency and abdominal pain subscores from the CDAI.6 Clin-
ical remission in Crohn’s disease is defined as PRO- 2 (abdominal
pain≤1 and stool frequency≤3) or HBI≤4.

Biochemical markers
Faecal calprotectin correlates with clinical, endoscopic and histo-
logical disease activity in Crohn’s disease,86 and its non- invasive
attribute  positions  it  within  a  key  role  in  monitoring  patients
in remission. However, determining a specific target to trigger
further disease assessment is more challenging due to variability
among patients’ phenotypes; faecal calprotectin in patients with
isolated small bowel Crohn’s disease shows weaker correlation
with  endoscopic  activity  than  in  patients  with  colonic  disease.
Faecal  calprotectin  should  therefore  be  used  as  an  adjunct  to
endoscopic and radiological investigations and be calibrated to
each individual patient and phenotype.6

Figure 3 outlines a suggested approach to interpreting faecal
calprotectin  for  monitoring  of  Crohn’s  disease  clinical  remis-
sion. Subsequent actions will depend on disease phenotype and
treatment history, with a general principle of advocating endo-
scopic and/or radiological evaluation before deciding on signifi-
cant changes to therapy.

Histology
Despite progressive debates in recent years on the topic of histological
healing as a treatment target, histological remission is not currently
recommended  as  a  treatment  target  by  STRIDE  II  for  Crohn’s
disease.6 This might partly be explained by the lack of consensus on
the definition of histological remission, and the limited effectiveness
of available therapies in achieving histological remission.

Non-invasive imaging and assessment of transmural healing
In  recognition  of  the  transmural  nature  of  Crohn’s  disease,
transmural healing (TH), defined as the normalisation of BWT,
has  been  suggested  as  a  treatment  goal.  Patients  with  Crohn’s
disease  with  TH  after  2  years  of  biological  therapy,  showed  a
lower risk of clinical relapse, hospitalisation and surgery in the
following  year,  compared  with  patients  with  mucosal  healing
alone.89 However, because of the limited ability of current avail-
able  treatments  to  achieve  TH,  STRIDE  II  recommends  TH
assessment with imaging as an adjunct to endoscopic remission,
rather than a formal isolated treatment target.6

Intestinal imaging is a valuable, non- invasive, complementary
option to endoscopy, as well as allowing evaluation for disease
complications,  such  as  stricturing  or  penetrating  disease,  and
assessment of perianal disease. MRE and US have the benefits of
limiting patient exposure to radiation, unlike CT imaging. Addi-
tionally, as for IUS, three main scores have now increasingly been
validated.90 Details of the relative accuracy of different modali-
ties areis covered in the diagnostic section above.

Endoscopy
Endoscopic  healing  (EH)  is  a  core  STRIDE- II  treatment  target
in  IBD  and  has  been  shown  to  correlate  with  improved  long-
term outcomes.6 EH is defined by a simple endoscopic score for
Crohn’s  disease  of  <3  points,  or  absence  of  ulcerations.6  The
limitations  of  endoscopies  in  assessing  patients  with  Crohn’s
disease include its invasiveness, costs, partial access to the small
bowel and inability to assess the intestinal tract wall beyond the
mucosa. A Lewis score of <135 in SBCE is consistent with EH.87
The emergent concept of deep remission refers to the presence
of both clinical remission and mucosal healing, with the absence of
corticosteroid therapy for ≥8 weeks. Its clinical impact stems from
the  CALM  study,  which  demonstrated  a  reduced  risk  of  disease
progression in patients meeting the criteria for deep remission.88

Quality of life
Quality  of  life  is  a  more  holistic  measurement  of  overall  well-
being. The LIR!C trial is an excellent example of the increasing
relevance  of  well- being  as  an  outcome.  The  study  compared
surgical  resection  with  anti- TNF  therapy  in  terminal  ileal
Crohn’s disease not responding to at least 3 months of conven-
tional therapy with corticosteroids, purine analogues or metho-
trexate, by assessing patients’ quality of life (QoL) using the IBD
Questionnaire as the primary outcome.91 Similarly, a randomised
controlled trial (RCT) by Sands et al demonstrated the positive
effect of ustekinumab on health- related QoL in an adult Crohn’s
disease  cohort,92  whereas  Herrera- deGuise  et  al  demonstrated
that restoration of QoL at 14 weeks after initiation of anti- TNF
therapy was associated with 1 year sustained remission.93

SBCE  is  useful  as  a  non- invasive  method  of  mucosal  assess-
ment in cases where there is disease involvement in the proximal
small bowel inaccessible by conventional ileocolonoscopy.

The STRIDE II panel voted to include restoration of QoL and
reduction  in  disability  as  formal  long- term  treatment  targets,
irrespective of other objective markers of inflammation.6

Upper GI Crohn’s disease

GPS 13

We recommend routine clinical assessment for upper
gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with Crohn’s disease to
determine if an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy is warranted in
patients experiencing upper gastrointestinal symptoms, but it is
otherwise not routinely needed.

The  prevalence  of  upper  gastrointestinal  Crohn’s  disease  is
reported as between 3% and 16% in some studies,94–96 although
prevalences of up to 75% have been quoted.97 It is hypothesised
that the presence of upper GI Crohn’s disease suggests a more
aggressive  phenotype.  It  is  widely  accepted  that  the  younger
age  of  diagnosis  of  Crohn’s  disease  suggests  a  more  aggressive
phenotype,  and  therefore  gastroscopy  is  recommended  along-
side ileocolonoscopy in the paediatric population, <17 years.98
However,  upper  GI  Crohn’s  disease  may  be  less  common  in
adults,  and  routine  gastroscopy  at  diagnosis  is  not  indicated.
The  present  recommendation  remains  to  request  gastroscopies
only in adult patients with Crohn’s disease who have upper GI
symptoms.

Histopathology of IBD
Recent comprehensive reviews and guidance documents on the
histological  assessment  of  IBD  are  available,  especially  from
ECCO.99–103  The  following  text  presents  good  practice  state-
ments and commentary for the most common and clinically rele-
vant aspects of histopathology, especially those directly relevant
to other sections of this guideline document.

In  the  setting  of  IBD,  histopathology  has  three  main  func-
tions—namely,  to  diagnose  IBD  (and  exclude  differential  or
additional  diagnoses);  to  determine  activity;  and  to  assess  for
neoplasia.  The  histopathology  of  IBD- related  neoplasia  is
covered  in  the  complementary  IBD  colorectal  cancer  surveil-
lance guideline.104

Endoscopy biopsy sampling of a patient with suspected new IBD
Therapy  for  IBD  can  alter  the  anatomical  distribution  and/or
histological features of IBD.105 106 Therefore, histological diag-
nosis  and  subtyping  of  IBD  is  best  performed  on  biopsy  spec-
imens  from  a  patient  with  suspected  new  IBD  who  has  not
received  treatment.  Histological  abnormalities  can  be  present
in  endoscopically  normal  mucosa  in  patients  with  IBD.107  For
example, the terminal ileum and/or right colon may show histo-
logical changes in a patient who only appears to have left- sided
disease  at  colonoscopy.  Therefore,  ileocolonoscopy  permits
optimal  tissue  sampling  for  suspected  new  IBD,  and  such
sampling  should  comprise  at  least  two  biopsy  specimens,  each
from  the  terminal  ileum,  from  at  least  four  different  colonic
segments (these segments being caecum, ascending colon, trans-
verse colon, descending colon and sigmoid colon) and from the
rectum.99  Biopsy  specimens  should  be  taken  from  abnormal,
non- ulcerated areas or from normal areas if there is no mucosal
abnormality  in  that  bowel  segment.99  The  biopsy  specimens
from different segments should be clearly separated and labelled
with their respective anatomical site of origin.

There  is  little  evidence  to  guide  how  many  biopsy  speci-
mens  should  be  taken  and  from  what  anatomical  sites  during
endoscopic  follow- up  of  patients  with  an  established  diagnosis

Guidelines

of  Crohn’s  disease  or  ulcerative  colitis.  However,  as  discussed
further below and elsewhere in this guideline document, histo-
logical remission is not considered a treatment target for Crohn’s
disease, and in ulcerative colitis may have a supplementary role
but is also not a mandatory treatment target.

GPS 14

Ileocolonoscopy is necessary for reliable diagnosis and
assessment of IBD, particularly at initial presentation. The
endoscopist should take at least two biopsy specimens each
from the terminal ileum, at least four different colonic segments,
and the rectum, and identify the sites of origin clearly. The
same thorough sampling protocol should be followed at any
subsequent endoscopy should a diagnosis of IBD, or designation
of subtype, remain uncertain.

Clinical information required for IBD biopsy assessment
Several other causes of ileitis and colitis can mimic the histolog-
ical features of IBD, including certain drugs, a variety of infec-
tions  and  diverticular  colitis.100  Therefore,  any  clinical  history
which  could  point  to  one  of  these  differential  diagnoses100
should  accompany  the  biopsies  to  aid  histological  assessment.
Diagnostic interpretation of biopsies is based not just on histo-
logical features, but also on knowing the nature and duration of
symptoms, the endoscopic appearance of the area sampled, and
the overall distribution of macroscopic disease along the bowel
segments.  Clinical  details  must  indicate  either  new  or  treated
IBD, because therapy can alter the anatomical distribution and
histological features considerably.105 106

GPS 15

Biopsies for the diagnosis of suspected new IBD should be
accompanied by full clinical details, including the nature and
duration of symptoms, current endoscopic findings, any past
history of IBD, past history of any other relevant conditions and
details of any systemic or topical therapies applied.

Histological features requiring assessment in biopsies
Inflammatory bowel disease typically shows chronic histological
changes in addition to acute inflammation. The chronic changes
include  architectural  distortion,  crypt  atrophy,  an  increase  in
lamina propria chronic inflammatory cells, and Paneth cell meta-
plasia.108 109

The microscopic features which help to distinguish IBD from
its histological differential diagnoses are outlined in detail else-
where.100 In general, crypt architectural disturbances and basal
plasmacytosis are the most reliable features favouring IBD over
acute infectious colitis and other non- IBD colitides.108 109

The  features  that  most  reliably  distinguish  ulcerative  colitis
from  Crohn’s  disease  include  granulomas  and  distribution  of
changes.  Non- cryptolytic  granulomas  are  not  necessary  for  a
diagnosis of Crohn’s disease and are present in only a minority
of samples, but strongly favour Crohn’s disease over ulcerative
colitis if present.110 In ulcerative colitis and other colitides, cryp-
tolytic granulomas may form in reaction to ruptured crypts.111
They are less useful than non- cryptolytic granulomas for distin-
guishing  Crohn’s  disease  from  ulcerative  colitis.  Regarding

distribution, ulcerative colitis almost always involves the rectum
at presentation and often extends continuously from the rectum
into the colon for a variable distance. Continuity between sites
and diffuse chronic changes within sites favour ulcerative colitis
over  Crohn’s  disease.  In  contrast,  Crohn’s  disease  is  typically
discontinuous  between  anatomical  sites  and  the  architectural
and inflammatory changes vary in intensity within and between
biopsies. Rectal sparing favours Crohn’s disease over ulcerative
colitis in the untreated patient. However, even at presentation,
there are exceptions to this pattern.

In both forms of IBD there is usually at least some degree of
histological activity—that is, acute inflammatory changes super-
imposed  on  chronic  changes  (see  below),  prior  to  initial  treat-
ment.  Evidence  of  activity  includes  neutrophils  in  the  lamina
propria, cryptitis, crypt abscesses, erosion and ulceration. Histo-
logical activity is not synonymous with endoscopic activity.

Atypical  epithelial  changes  in  IBD  biopsies  may  be  due  to
regenerative change or dysplasia. For the reasons outlined above,
the histological diagnosis of IBD- related dysplasia is not covered
here.

In children, new ulcerative colitis may demonstrate less crypt
distortion and atypical features, such as rectal sparing and skip
lesions.112 113 Granulomas are more common among paediatric
than adult patients with Crohn’s disease. There are further differ-
ences  between  children  and  adults  in  the  histological  features
and  anatomical  distributions  of  ulcerative  colitis  and  Crohn’s
disease, and these are described in more detail elsewhere.99

Certain  clinical  settings  of  IBD  require  assessment  of  endo-
scopic tissue for cytomegalovirus infection. Some suggest this is
best  performed  by  PCR  and/or  immunohistochemistry,  but  the
ideal approach to sampling, testing and interpretation is uncer-
tain.  Further  details  on  cytomegalovirus  assessment  of  tissue
from patients with IBD are available elsewhere.114

GPS 16

To help diagnose and subtype IBD histologically, biopsy
pathology reports should mention basal lamina propria chronic
inflammatory cell distribution, crypt architecture, crypt atrophy,
lamina propria neutrophils, neutrophils in the surface and
crypt epithelium (cryptitis), crypt abscesses, erosions, ulcers,
granulomas and atypical epithelial changes.

Histological features of activity in IBD
It is generally agreed that neither the lamina propria nor epithe-
lium  of  normal  large  bowel  mucosa  should  contain  neutro-
phils.  Some  have  suggested  that  the  presence  of  one,  two,  or
even three neutrophils, particularly in the lamina propria, is not
indicative of acute inflammation, but the topic remains contro-
versial.108 115 Bowel preparation could explain some instances of
small  numbers  of  neutrophils.  Neutrophils  lying  solely  within
a  capillary  lumen  do  not  define  acute  inflammation.  There  is
also no universal agreement on the minimum number of neutro-
phils required to define a crypt abscess.116 Some definitions refer
to  a  ‘cluster’  or  ‘chain’  of  neutrophils,  whereas  general  defini-
tions of ‘abscess’ usually require the presence of more than one
neutrophil.

An  ECCO  consensus  panel  agreed  that  one  intraepithelial
neutrophil  is  sufficient  to  define  cryptitis.101  The  panel  also
agreed that at least two neutrophils should be present within a
crypt lumen to define a crypt abscess.101

The convention is to interpret the terms ‘cryptitis’ and ‘crypt
abscesses’  as  referring  to  neutrophil  cryptitis  and  neutrophil
crypt  abscesses.  Cryptitis  or  a  crypt  abscess  can  include  other
inflammatory  cells  in  addition  to  the  neutrophil.  However,
cryptitis  or  crypt  abscesses  which  contain  eosinophils  without
neutrophils are not regarded as markers of IBD activity.

In the GI tract, an erosion is defined as a mucosal defect which
does not extend deep to muscularis mucosae, whereas an ulcer
extends  at  least  into  submucosa.117  However,  distinguishing
between erosions and ulcers may be difficult or impossible when
assessing  biopsies,  especially  if  they  are  superficial  and  lack
muscularis  mucosae  and  submucosa.  Both  erosions  and  ulcers
can  show  granulation  tissue,  surface  fibrin  and/or  neutrophils
and, for ulcers, proliferating fibroblasts in the submucosa.117 The
mucosa  adjacent  to  erosions  and  ulcers  may  show  evidence  of
re- epithelialisation,  and  this  regenerative  epithelium  can  show
cytological atypia.

GPS 17

Histological activity in IBD is defined by at least one
intraepithelial neutrophil or a crypt abscess with at least two
neutrophils or at least two neutrophils in the lamina propria
or erosion or ulceration or a combination of these features.
Eosinophils are not a marker of activity.

Histological scoring systems for ulcerative colitis
The past seven decades has seen the proposal of more than 30
scoring systems for histological inflammation and/or histological
activity  in  IBD.102  These  systems  variably  include  assessments
of  mucosal  architecture,  mononuclear  cell  infiltrate,  eosino-
phils,  neutrophils  (in  the  lamina  propria  or  epithelium),  crypt
destruction and erosions/ulcers.102 They vary considerably in the
number  and  range  of  histological  features  assessed,  the  termi-
nology and the approach to categorising severity, making direct
comparisons difficult.

Among  the  older  systems,  the  Gupta,  Geboes,  Truelove  and
Riley systems118–121 are well known. The Geboes score is widely
used, although only partially validated.102 Two more recent and
better  validated  systems  are  the  Nancy  Histological  Index  and
the Robarts Histopathology Index (RHI).122–124

Compared  with  the  RHI,  the  Nancy  Index  presents  fewer
grade options for each parameter assessed. Further, a final Nancy
Index is derived through a stepwise process rather than through
the  more  complex  calculation  that  is  required  for  a  final  RHI
score. Therefore, the Nancy Index may be more appropriate for
clinical applications.

GPS 18

The Robarts Histopathology Index and Nancy Index are fully
validated scores for assessing histological inflammation in
ulcerative colitis. The Nancy Index is most appropriate for clinical
applications. The Geboes score is widely used, but less well
validated.

Histological remission in ulcerative colitis
There  are  numerous  definitions  of  histological  remission  or
histological mucosal healing. These vary from completely normal
mucosa  to  an  absence  of  various  histological  abnormalities  to

s18

scores in various systems that lie below certain thresholds. For
example,  histological  remission  could  be  defined  as  a  Geboes
score ≤2.0, 125, a Nancy Index=0123 or RHI≤3 (with subscores
of 0 for lamina propria neutrophils and neutrophils in the epithe-
lium and without ulcers or erosions).124

Despite increasing debate in recent years regarding histolog-
ical  healing  as  a  treatment  target,  histologic  remission  is  not
recommended by STRIDE II as a treatment target in ulcerative
colitis.94 There is no currently accepted consensus on the defi-
nition  of  histologic  remission,  and  current  available  therapies
have  limited  effectiveness  for  achieving  histologic  remission.
However,  histologic  remission  could  be  used  as  an  adjunct  to
endoscopic remission to represent a deeper level of healing.94

‘Histological  response’  has  a  different  definition  from  histo-
logical  remission.  The  need  to  formally  define  and  quantify
histological  response  is  less  relevant  to  the  recommendations
of  this  guideline.  Definitions  of  histological  response  are  not
outlined here, but may be found elsewhere.102

GPS 19

Definitions of histological remission in ulcerative colitis are
numerous and include: histological normalisation; absence
of inflammation: absence of neutrophils/erosion/ulceration;
absence of intraepithelial neutrophils/erosions/ulceration; RHI≤3;
Nancy Index=0; Geboes score ≤2.0.

Biopsy assessment of disease activity in Crohn’s disease
Crohn’s  disease  usually  manifests  as  discontinuous  bowel
disease and also has the potential to involve any part of the GI
tract.125–127  This  increases  the  possibility  of  non- representative
biopsy  sampling  and  hampers  or  prevents  endoscopic  access
to  abnormal  and  clinically  relevant  foci.  Furthermore,  because
Crohn’s  disease  is  typically  transmural,  endoscopic  and  biopsy
findings may fail to represent clinically relevant changes occur-
ring in bowel layers deep to the mucosa.128 129

GPS 20

In Crohn' s disease, biopsy appearances may not accurately
reflect disease activity.

Histological scoring systems for Crohn’s disease
More  than  14  histological  indexes  have  been  proposed  for
Crohn’s disease,103 but none is fully validated, and none is widely
accepted for use in clinical trials or in clinical practice.126 130–132
An ideal histological scoring system for Crohn’s disease should
quantify disease activity separately at different anatomical sites.
The Global Histological Activity Score (GHAS) was designed to
do so,133 and remains a widely used scoring system for Crohn’s
disease. However, this system has not been fully validated, and
its inclusion of granulomas has been questioned.103 Furthermore,
compared  with  colonic  disease,  GHAS  scoring  of  ileal  disease
shows  lower  interobserver  consistency134  and  less  correlation
with faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin levels.125

Several  attempts  have  been  made  to  apply  ulcerative  colitis
histological  scoring  systems  (especially  the  Geboes  score,  the
Nancy Index and the RHI) to Crohn’s disease.135–138 The results
have  been  conflicting.  For  example,  Almradi  and  colleagues
reported that both the Geboes score and the RHI are appropriate

Guidelines

for use in Crohn’s disease, but were less certain about the appli-
cability  of  the  Nancy  Index.131  By  contrast,  Villanacci  and
colleagues  scored  ulcerative  colitis  and  Crohn’s  disease  cases
with  these  three  systems  as  well  as  the  Extension,  Chronicity,
Activity, Plus (ECAP) system and their own novel scoring system,
and reported that the Nancy Index had the highest interobserver
agreement.137  However,  all  ulcerative  colitis  scoring  systems
have limitations for Crohn’s disease because they were designed
to assess large bowel mucosa alone.

GPS 21

The Global Histological Activity Score is the most commonly
used histological scoring system specific to Crohn’s disease, but
it lacks validation. No well- validated system for Crohn’s disease
exists. Histological scoring systems for ulcerative colitis—
including the Geboes score, RHI and Nancy Index—have been
used to assess intestinal biopsies from patients with Crohn’s
disease, but are designed for assessing large bowel disease only.

Predictive value of histology in ulcerative colitis
Histological activity may be present in the absence of endoscopic
activity.107  In  patients  with  endoscopically  quiescent  ulcerative
colitis,  absence  of  histological  activity  predicts  a  lower  likeli-
hood  of  relapse  or  exacerbation  of  disease  in  some  reports.139
Furthermore,  the  presence  of  histological  remission  predicts  a
lower risk of hospitalisation,140 corticosteroid use140 and colec-
tomy.141 Histological examination may therefore supplement the
ability  of  endoscopic  examination  to  predict  long- term  remis-
sion.107 142 143

However, while certain ulcerative colitis histological features
may  be  associated  with  failure  of  medical  therapy,144  145  there
are  limited  data  addressing  whether  histological  activity  is  an
independent  predictor  of  the  need  to  escalate  to  biologic  and/
or immunomodulator therapy in ulcerative colitis. Furthermore,
there  has  been  recent  international  agreement  that  histolog-
ical  remission  is  a  difficult  target  to  achieve,  especially  when
balanced against the risks and costs of therapies required.6 The
STRIDE II group did not recommend histological remission as
an  independent  treatment  target,  but  did  acknowledge  that  it
may supplement endoscopic remission as a marker of a deeper
level of healing.6

GPS 22

Microscopic activity may be present in endoscopically quiescent
ulcerative colitis. The absence of histological activity in this
setting is associated with a better clinical outcome. Histological
remission could be used as an adjunct to endoscopic remission
to indicate a deeper level of healing, but is not a mandatory
treatment target for ulcerative colitis.

Predictive value of histology in Crohn’s disease
Certain  histological  features  of  Crohn’s  disease  may  predict
poorer  disease  course  and  worse  prognosis.146  Furthermore,
histological remission of Crohn’s disease appears to have some
predictive  value.  Among  patients  with  only  ileal  disease,  such
remission  was  associated  with  a  lower  risk  of  clinical  relapse,
escalation  of  medication  and  corticosteroid  use.147  In  a  study

Guidelines

of 215 patients with Crohn’s disease who achieved clinical and
endoscopic remission through treatment optimisation, histolog-
ical remission was associated with a lower risk of relapse.148

However,  there  is  no  universal  acceptance  that  histological
activity and histological remission have independent prognostic
value  in  Crohn’s  disease.  Some  of  this  uncertainty  may  result
from the use by previous studies of different definitions of histo-
logical activity and remission. Because of the latter and the fact
that current therapies have limited efficacy in attaining histolog-
ical remission in Crohn’s disease, there has been recent interna-
tional consensus that remission should not represent a treatment
target for Crohn’s disease.6 This consensus recommendation is
further supported by the fact that biopsy histology may not be
representative of disease activity in Crohn’s disease.

GPS 23

In Crohn’s disease, histological remission may predict a better
clinical outcome. However, histological remission is not a
mandatory treatment target for Crohn ’s disease.

Preassessment required before biologics/immunosuppressants
The  rates  of  serious  and  opportunistic  infections  are  higher  in
patients with IBD with moderate to severe disease taking purine
analogues, biologics and/or small molecules. In a study involving
38  850  patients  receiving  purine  analogues  and/or  anti  TNFs,
the incident rate for serious infections was 9.4 per 1000 person
years.  These  included  chest,  GI,  skin,  urothelial,  ENT,  central
nervous  system  and  musculoskeletal  infections.149  The  risk  of
serious infections is lower with ustekinumab, p19 antibodies and
vedolizumab.  There  is  higher  incidence  of  herpes  zoster  infec-
tion  with  JAK  inhibitors  compared  with  biological  therapies,
evident  as  a  class  effect.  Yet  filgotinib,  a  highly  selective  JAK1
inhibitor, has a lower risk of herpes zoster than tofacitinib.150 151
When disease status is reviewed or prior to changing biolog-
ical/small  molecules  therapy,  we  advise  re- evaluating  the  risk
factors for serious and opportunistic infections.

Tuberculosis
The incidence of new TB and latent TB reactivation in patients
receving biological agents is significantly higher than that of the
general  population.  Rheumatological  data  demonstrated  that
the risk of TB reactivation has fallen from 50- fold to a 90- fold
increase prior to routine pre- biologics testing, with an incidence
risk ratio of 19 (95% CI 11 to 32) to 1.8 (95% CI 0.28 to 7.1))
following  implementation  of  screening.152  Although  there  is  a
paucity of data for newer drugs, emerging data suggest a lower
risk  with  ustekinumab  and  vedolizumab  than  with  infliximab
and  adalimumab.  Purine  analogues,  methotrexate  and  5- ASA
confer a lower risk than other agents.

Cumulative doses of corticosteroids also confer a higher risk
of reactivation.153 Immunosuppressive therapies and corticoste-
roids  affect  the  sensitivity  of  biochemical  and  skin  diagnostic
tests for TB,154–160 therefore we recommend clinical risk stratifi-
cation and testing of all patients with IBD at the point diagnosis
and/or  prior  to  starting  any  IBD  therapy.  Should  risk  factors
change, repeat of TB tests during therapy should be considered.
We recommend an interferon-λ release assay (IGRA) and a chest
X- ray examination as minimum tests.161 Any indeterminate IGRA
should  also  be  discussed  with  the  TB  team  for  consideration
of  further  tests  such  as  tuberculin  skin  test  or  induced  sputum

GPS 24

All patients with IBD in whom advanced therapies are initiated
should receive written information about the benefits, risks, side
effects of treatment and their monitoring schedules.

Prior to starting advanced therapies, the following are

recommended:

Pre- assessment history:

 ⇒ Infections: relevant symptoms, exposure and contact

history for TB, history of HSV (oral, genital) and VZV (χ,
shingles);

 ⇒ Thromboembolic and cardiac risk factors: hypertension,

high cholesterol, smoking status, previous arrhythmias and
ischaemic heart disease;

 ⇒ Previous history of cervical and/or anal dysplasia;
 ⇒ Previous history of all cancers, including skin;
 ⇒ Other immune disorders, such as multiple sclerosis.

Specialist investigations:
Blood:

 ⇒ TPMT (all patients);
 ⇒ NUDT15 (East and South Asian patients), where available;
 ⇒ IGRA for TB (please use locally available assay), EBV, HBV,

HCV, HIV and, if no previous history, VZV.

Imaging:

 ⇒ Chest X- ray;
 ⇒ ECG, if ozanimod or etrasimod are considered.

Optical coherence tomography

 ⇒ If ozanimod or etrasimod are considered.

Screening:

 ⇒ Encourage cervical screening in all females;
 ⇒ Advise all patients to take part in national cancer screening

programmes.

Surveillance:

 ⇒ Skin mapping by GP with special interest or dermatology

culture.  Patients  whose  risk  factors,  such  as  contact  or  expo-
sure history, change while receiving immunosuppressive therapy
should also be discussed with the local TB team. Although there
is moderate to good concordance between IGRA and the tuber-
culin skin test, the latter is affected by BCG vaccination and the
former is more cost- effective.153 162

An interferon-λ release assay (IGRA) and a chest X- ray
examination are the minimum tests for low- risk patients.

lymphohistiocytosis,  B-  or  T/
NK- cell  lymphomas,  other  malignancies,  including  nasopha-
ryngeal carcinoma, post- transplant lymphoproliferative disease,
gastric adenocarcinoma and autoimmune diseases.

One  study  reported  that  29%  of  patients  between  the  ages
of 18–25 years are seronegative for EBV and at risk of primary
EBV  infection,  which  may  result  in  adverse  outcomes  such  as
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.15 In another large study
involving  1582  adult  patients,  an  overall  seroprevalence  rate
of  97.4%  dropped  to  90.8%  in  patients  younger  than  30.163
Reported risk of lymphoma with use of purine analogues in IBD
varies between studies, and one of the large cohorts, CESAME,
quoted multivariate HR as 5.28 (95% CI 2.01 to 13.9).164 That
study  found  that  older  age,  male  gender  and  longer  duration
positively  correlated  with  lymphoma.  In  a  study  involving  17
834  patients  with  IBD,  92%  of  patients  who  developed  EBV-
positive lymphoma were exposed to purine analogues compared
with 19% of patients with EBV- negative lymphomas.165 Although
infliximab and adalimumab have lower risks as monotherapies,
combination  with  purine  analogues  confers  greater  risk  than
purine analogue monotherapy (0.69 and 0.28 per 1000 person-
years respectively).166 Data are limited for newer drugs.

We suggest screening for EBV in patients before starting purine
analogues, biologics and small molecule therapies. It should be
noted that there is poor concordance between blood and tissue
EBV DNA counts.165 Diagnostic methodologies may change in
the future. There is a level of uncertainty relating to what to do
with EBV status, so a risk/benefit discussion should be had with
individual  patients  relating  to  the  efficacy  of  purine  analogues
especially in ulcerative colitis, anti- TNF therapy in both Crohn’s
disease and ulcerative colitis, and their perceived risk.

GPS 26

We suggest screening for EBV in all patients before starting
purine analogues and anti- TNF therapy. In seronegative patients,
discussion should be had about choosing other advanced
therapies rather than purine analogues and anti- TNF therapy.
Patients who are seronegative and in whom purine analogues/
anti- TNF therapy is started should be closely monitored should
they develop acute EBV infection while receiving this treatment.

Varicella
In  a  study  involving  108  604  patients  with  IBD,  the  incident
risk ratio of herpes zoster (HZ) was 1.68 (95% CI 1.60 to 1.76)
compared with patients without IBD. Subgroup analysis showed
elevated risk with anti- TNF therapy (1.81, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.21),
corticosteroids  (1.73,  95%  CI  1.51  to  1.99),  purine  analogues
(1.85,  95%  CI  1.61  to  2.13)  and  combination  therapy  (3.29,
95% CI 2.33 to 4.65), which were all independently associated
with HZ.167

In a post hoc analysis of HZ incidence from the entire tofac-
itinib  ulcerative  colitis  clinical  programme,  an  overall  incident
rate (IR) of 3.62 (95% CI 1.33 to 7.88) was shown in the induc-
tion cohort vsersu placebo (IR=1.98 95% CI 0.05 to 11.05). In
the maintenance cohort, both 10 mg BD (two times a day) and 5
mg BD were associated with increased HZ risk.168 Elevated risk
of HZ have also been shown with newer JAK inhibitors, upad-
acitinib169 and filgotinib,170 although data are limited. HZ reac-
tivation is independent of previous exposure to varicella zoster
virus or vaccination.

Guidelines

All  patients  with  IBD  should  have  a  thorough  history  taken
about  their  past  medical  history  of  varicella  zoster  virus  and
vaccinations.

We recommend serological testing for varicella zoster IgG in
patients who do not recollect previous history of varicella before
starting any immunosuppressive therapy. Please refer to vaccina-
tions section for seronegative patients.

GPS 27

We recommend serological testing for varicella zoster IgG in
patients with no previous history of chicken pox before starting
any immunosuppressive therapy.

Hepatitis B and C
In  a  systematic  review  and  meta- analysis  of  the  prevalence  of
hepatitis B and C in patients with IBD globally, the overall pooled
prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen was 3.3% (95% CI 2.5
to  4.0)  across  Europe  and  Asia,  similar  to  that  of  the  general
population.  The  prevalence  of  hepatitis  B  core  antibody  was
14.2% (95% CI 10.6% to 17.8%), which was higher in patients
with IBD than in the general population. Only 35.6% (95% CI
28.7 % to 42.4%) of patients with IBD had effective immunisa-
tion against hepatitis B. The prevalence of anti- hepatitis C anti-
body was 1.8% (95% CI 1.2% to 2.4%), which was not different
from that of the general population. Untreated, hepatitis B and
C  can  lead  to  liver  fibrosis,  cirrhosis  and  hepatocellular  carci-
noma.171  172  Immunosuppressive  therapies  carry  a  risk  of  reac-
tivation  of  chronic  hepatitis  B  and  C  infections;  therefore,  we
recommend screening for both viruses before starting any immu-
nosuppressive therapy, and discussion with hepatology about all
patients who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and/or
hepatitis C antibody.

GPS 28

All patients should be screened for hepatitis B and C, before
starting any immunosuppressive therapy, and patients who
are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen/core antibody and/
or hepatitis C antibody should be discussed with the local
hepatology team.



















HIV

GPS 29

We recommend offering an HIV test to all patients with IBD as a
public health measure, and mandating screening for HIV before
starting any advanced therapy, including corticosteroids. All
positive results should be discussed with a dedicated HIV team.

The  prevalence  of  HIV  is  similar  in  patients  with  IBD  to  that
of  the  general  population.  Patients  with  HIV  and  stable  CD4
counts are able to receive immunosuppressive therapies without
an  increase  in  opportunistic  infections.  Data  on  biologics  and
HIV have been limited.173 174

Guidelines

Cervical and anal cancer screening
Incidence of cervical high- grade neoplasia is higher in patients
with  IBD  than  in  the  general  population  (OR=1.34;  95%  CI
1.34  to  1.46),175  therefore  we  recommend  regular  cervical
screening for all female patients.

Although  the  overall  incidence  of  anal  cancer  is  low  (0.01–
0.02 per 1000 patient years), risk factors have been identified:
men  who  have  sex  with  men,  women  with  cervical  dysplasia,
and fistula in established (>10 years) perianal Crohn’s disease.
The incidence can be as high as 0.38 per 1000 years in the last
group.176  177  Although  most  anal  cancers  are  of  squamous  cell
origin and related to HPV, adenocarcinoma related to anal fistula
also develops. In patients with high risk factors, we encourage
consideration  of  referral  to  a  local  anal  cancer  screening
programme.

GPS 30

All female patients with IBD should be encouraged to take part
in national cervical screening and HPV vaccination programme.

Other drugspecific considerations
Skin cancer
The use of purine analogues, methotrexate and anti- TNF therapy
in patients with IBD has been associated with skin cancers.178–180
We advise counselling about skin cancer in all patients, and use
of sun block when exposed to direct sunlight. Patients who are at
increased risk of skin cancers, above and beyond that conveyed
by  advanced  immunosuppressive  therapy,  such  as  those  who
have  had  previous  non- melanoma  skin  cancers,  should  have
formal skin mapping by a GP or dermatologist.181

Cholesterol
All  JAK  inhibitors  increase  both  HDL  and  LDL  cholesterol
levels. A study looking at tofacitinib has shown that this stabi-
lises after week 8 during 4.4 years of follow- up.182 This is not
associated with any adverse outcome and the clinical significance
is still uncertain. We recommend measurement of cholesterol at
baseline and after initiation of JAK inhibitors and consideration
of statin therapy by primary care clinicians in accordance with
best practice.

Venous thromboembolism and major adverse cardiovascular events
In the ORAL surveillance study, a large cohort of patients with
rheumatoid arthritis aged more than 50, and with one risk factor
for a cardiovascular event were reported to have higher incidence
rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), deep vein
thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) and venous throm-
boembolism  (VTE)  with  tofacitinib  than  TNF  inhibitors,  with
rates for 10 mg bd higher than 5 mg bd.183 In ulcerative colitis,
a post hoc analysis of an ulcerative colitis programme, including
one phase 2 and phase 3 OCTAVE trial with open label exten-
sion, reported 0.04 events/100 patient- years of exposure (95%
CI 0.00 to 0.23) for DVT and 0.16/100 patient- years (95% CI
0.04 to 0.41) for PE with tofacitinib 10 mg bd dose.184 A subse-
quent post hoc analysis of the ORAL surveillance study reported
differential  risks  for  MACE,  DVT,  PE  and  VTE  between  two
groups for tofacitinib compared with anti- TNFs: ‘age >65 years
and ever smoker’ (high- risk group) and ‘age <65 years and never
smoked’ (low- risk group), where the DVT, PE and VTE events
were associated with the high- risk groups only.185 The European
Medicines Agency (EMA) and Medicines and Healthcare prod-
ucts Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have therefore advised caution

when using JAK inhibitors in patients who are above the age or
65 and/or have one or more cardiovascular risk factor.186

Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators
Sphingosine- 1- phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators have been
associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, chronic
cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, pericarditis and elevated
blood  pressure.  Retrospective  analysis  from  True  North,
SUNBEAM  and  RADIANCE  trials  for  ulcerative  colitis  and
multiple sclerosis have shown that cardiac adverse events were
low: 1.3% of the total patients experienced bradycardia; other
cardiac events occurred in 0.4%; 2 of 882 patients with multiple
sclerosis  experienced  serious  cardiac  events.  We  recommend
comprehensive history should be taken about cardiovascular risk
factors and past medical cardiac problems. S1P receptor modu-
lators are contraindicated in a number of cardiac conditions. An
ECG  should  be  taken  before  starting  S1P  receptor  modulators
and should be reviewed for arrhythmias, QT interval and atrio-
ventricular conduction problems. Patients with ECG abnormali-
ties beyond first- degree atrioventricular block or with significant
cardiac  comorbidities  should  be  discussed  with  a  cardiologist
prior  to  starting  S1P  receptor  modulator  modulators.  Patients
with  risk  factors  or  a  history  of  macular  oedema  should  have
a baseline ophthalmic examination before, or within a specific
time frame of, initiating therapy.

Vaccinations prior to immunosuppressants

GPS 31

Vaccination history should be obtained, and vaccinations
updated at diagnosis for all patients with Crohn’s disease and
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, and before
starting immunomodulator or advanced therapy in all patients.
Live vaccines may be administered at least 4 weeks before
starting and at a minimum of 3 months after stopping, but not
while receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

Non-live vaccines
Patients  with  IBD  have  a  greater  risk  of  contracting  influenza
than  non- IBD  populations  (IR=1.58;  95%  CI  1.49  to  1.68)
and are more likely to require admission to hospital.187 Annual
influenza vaccination is recommended for all immunosuppressed
patients,188–190 although vaccine efficacy may be reduced, partic-
ularly in those receiving anti- TNF therapy and JAK inhibitors.191
The  oral  influenza  vaccine  formulation  contains  live  virus  and
should  be  avoided;  the  non- live  injection  is  favoured  instead.
Immunosuppressed  patients  harbour  a  theoretical  risk  tof
acquiring  influenza  from  household  contacts  who  receive  the
live  attenuated  influenza  vaccine.  However,  no  cases  of  trans-
mission have been reported after 10 million doses administered
in the UK, and the risk to patients on IBD therapies is therefore
likely to be extremely low.190

Assessment  of  hepatitis  B  serology  followed  by  vaccination
for  all  seronegative  patients  at  diagnosis  is  recommended  in
ECCO guidelines. The value of this approach in low prevalence
countries has been questioned. In the UK it may be more appro-
priate to offer vaccines to high- risk groups based on lifestyle,
occupation or other high- risk factors.192 Efficacy of vaccination
may  be  impaired  in  two  situations:  during  active  IBD193  and
during exposure to immunosuppressive drugs.194 195 Following
hepatitis B vaccination, anti- HBs response should be measured

Patients with IBD receiving immunomodulators or advanced
therapies should receive influenza vaccination each autumn,
pneumococcal vaccination with a booster after 5 years, and
6month- ly SARS- CoV- 2 vaccination adjusted according to the
most recent best practice. General advice about vaccination is
given below.
 ⇒ Live vaccines are contraindicated in patients receiving
immunosuppressive therapy or with significant protein
calorie malnutrition. Live vaccines include BCG, attenuated
(oral) influenza, measles, mumps and rubella, oral polio (no
longer in routine use in the UK),767 rotavirus, oral typhoid
Ty21a, varicella zoster, yellow fever, live shingles (Zostavax).
Immunosuppressive therapies include: corticosteroids
(prednisolone ≥20 mg/day or equivalent for 2 weeks or
more), purine analogues, methotrexate, biologic and other
advanced therapies.

 ⇒ Immunomodulators should be withheld for 4 weeks after live

vaccine administration.

 ⇒ Live vaccines should be avoided for at least 3 months after
discontinuing treatment with the immunosuppressive
therapies above.

 ⇒ Infants exposed to biologics in utero should not receive
live vaccines for 12 months after birth (see also 0: Infant
vaccinations after exposure to biologics). Live rotavirus
vaccine may be provided on schedule to children within utero
exposure to anti- TNF.

 ⇒ Patients with IBD on immunosuppressant therapy should
receive pneumococcal vaccine and annual influenza
vaccination (before starting treatment if possible) with a
single pneumococcal booster at 5 years.

 ⇒ Recombinant zoster vaccination (Shingrix) should be

considered in all patients aged 50 or over receiving any
immunomodulators or advanced therapies, and patients
aged 18 and over starting JAK inhibitors. All adults aged
50 years and over (regardless of therapy) are now eligible for
recombinant zoster vaccination.

 ⇒ Live varicella vaccination can be considered in patients
with IBD with no known history of chickenpox who are
varicella antibody negative. Where it is not possible to
identify a window of opportunity to administer the vaccine
without ongoing immune- modifying therapies, patients
should be advised to seek guidance on post- exposure
prophylaxis if exposed to active chickenpox or herpes
zoster.

as  higher  doses  may  be  required.  Accelerated  double- dose
vaccination in IBD has been shown to improve response, with
double- dose Engerix- B vaccine at 0, 1 and 2 months.196Pneu-
mococcal vaccination may also be affected by immunosuppres-
sion and should ideally be administered at least 2 weeks before
starting  immunosuppressive  therapy.  Three  pneumococcal
vaccines are licensed in the UK: pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccine  (PPV23,  containing  polysaccharide  from  23  capsular
types  of  pneumococcus)  and  two  variants  of  pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine (PCV13 and PCV10, containing polysaccha-
ride from 13 and 10 capsular types of pneumococcus).197 The
current  recommendation  for  adults  on  immunosuppression  is
a single dose of PCV13 followed by PPV23 at least 2 months
later; however, we recommend reviewing the Green Book for
further details. Booster pneumococcal vaccination with PPV23

Guidelines

is  recommended  after  5  years  in  patients  who  are  asplenic,
hyposplenic or have chronic renal disease. It also seems reason-
able to give boosters to patients on long- term immunomodu-
lator and advanced therapy, although there is little evidence in
this group.

During  earlier  phases  of  the  COVID- 19  pandemic,  the
UK  government  and  the  BSG  recommended  that  patients  on
immune- modifying  therapies  receive  three  primary  doses  of
SARS- CoV- 2 vaccination.198 These patients continue to be recom-
mended 6- monthly booster doses in seasonal spring and autumn
campaigns.  Household  contacts  aged  12  to  64  of  immunosup-
pressed patients have also been eligible for the autumn booster.
If a patient who is unvaccinated starts immune- modifying thera-
pies, they should be offered two doses of a SARS- CoV- 2 vaccine,
3 months apart, before receiving their regular boosters via the
seasonal campaign.199 These recommendations reflect the impact
of immune- modifying therapies, particularly anti- TNFs and JAK
inhibitors,  on  both  serological  and  clinical  responses  to  SARS-
CoV- 2 vaccines.200 201

Herpes  zoster  can  cause  serious  complications  as  well  as
long- term  sequelae.  In  a  meta- analysis,  JAK  inhibitors,  in
particular, seemed to increase the risk of zoster.202 The Green
Book  recommends  vaccination  with  the  recombinant  zoster
vaccine  (Shingrix)  at  age  60  for  all  adults,  as  well  as  from
50 for those on immunosuppressive therapies.199 There is no
current UK recommendation for vaccination in most patients
under  the  age  of  50,  although  the  ECCO  guidelines  recom-
mend  recombinant  zoster  vaccine  in  all  patients  receiving
immunosuppressive  therapy.203  The  UK  Joint  Committee  on
Vaccination  and  Immunisation  has  broadened  the  eligibility
for the vaccination programme for the Shingrix recombinant
herpes  zoster  vaccine  (GlaxoSmithKline,  London,  UK)  to
include  all  severely  immunosuppressed  adults  aged  18  years
and older in the UK.204

Clinicians may wish to discuss recombinant zoster vaccine in
patients aged between 18 and 49 who have started or are plan-
ning to start JAK inhibitors or S1P modulators, in view of the
particular increased risk with this class of therapy.202

Live vaccines
The UK Department of Health currently recommends a 4week-
window between live vaccination and starting immunosuppres-
sive or biologics therapy to allow establishment of an immune
response.205 Live vaccination should be avoided during biologics
therapy  and  for  a  minimum  of  3  months  after  stopping,206–208
although the evidence to support the 3- month period is lacking;
drug blood levels will be minimal by at the early stage of therapy,
but  this  may  still  alter  white  cell  populations,  with  persistent
subtle effects on immunity.

Live  varicella  vaccination  can  be  considered  for  patients
without a history of chickenpox and who are varicella antibody
negative. In practice the timing of this can be difficult in view of
the need to avoid use of immune- modifying therapies (including
corticosteroids)  on  either  side  of  the  course  of  two  doses.  If  a
suitable  window  of  time  cannot  be  identified  for  vaccination,
patients with IBD starting  immune- modifying  therapies should
be  advised  to  avoid  contact  with  people  with  active  chick-
enpox or herpes zoster and to seek guidance on post- exposure
prophylaxis  if  exposed  to  active  chickenpox  or  herpes  zoster
in accordance with the Green Book chapter 34.209 Current UK
guidelines recommend aciclovir in this situation rather than vari-
cella immunoglobulin, with a 7- day course starting 7 days after
the exposure.205

Guidelines

ULCERATIVE COLITIS
The  treatment  of  ulcerative  colitis  is  guided  mainly  by  disease
location and severity.

Ulcerative proctitis is treated with topical 5- ASA therapy. For
patients  who  do  not  respond,  or  if  treatment  is  not  tolerated,
oral  5- ASA  or  topical  corticosteroids  are  added  or  substituted.
Refractory  proctitis  might  require  oral  corticosteroids,  topical
tacrolimus, JAK inhibitors, S1P agonists or biologic therapy.

Mild  to  moderate  ulcerative  colitis  extending  beyond  the
rectum is treated with oral 5- ASA, which can be combined with
topical 5- ASA therapy. If a response to treatment is not achieved
within  2–4  weeks,  oral  corticosteroids  should  be  initiated.  If
response  is  achieved,  maintenance  therapy  with  5- ASA  should
be continued.

Prednisolone  is  recommended  for  induction  of  remission  in
moderate  to  severe  ulcerative  colitis  and  should  be  combined
with  5- ASA.  High- dose  5- ASA  alone  can  be  considered,  but
corticosteroids should be initiated if there is no response within
2 weeks.

Advanced therapy (biologic and small molecule drugs) should
be started if there is no adequate response to oral corticosteroids
within 2 weeks, if the corticosteroid taper is unsuccessful, or to
avoid  repeated  courses  of  corticosteroids.  To  avoid  long- term
disease  complications,  the  overall  treatment  goal  in  ulcerative
colitis has shifted from achieving clinical response to achieving
remission and should be assessed biochemically or endoscopically
and  histologically.  Maintenance  therapy  should  be  continued
with  the  agent  successful  in  achieving  induction,  with  the
important exception that corticosteroids are not recommended
for long- term maintenance. For maintenance, purine analogues
can be used, but usually require induction with another agent,
often a corticosteroid. They are also suggested alongside inflix-
imab therapy.

The  increasing  number  of  effective  ulcerative  colitis  treat-
ments  has  complicated  treatment  selection,  and  the  choice  of
advanced therapy requires consideration of patient and disease
factors and prior treatment history. It is also dependent on local
availability and reimbursement pathways.

Use of steroids in ulcerative colitis
Grade statement: Prednisolone
Summary of evidence: This study comprised 210 patients with
active disease or relapse randomised to cortisone or placebo. The
cortisone doses were as follows: 100 mg a day for 6 weeks in 38
patients, 100 mg a day for 2–3 weeks followed by smaller doses
of 50–75 mg a day in 38 patients, doses exceeding 100 mg a day
in 17 patients. All patients had treatment for a total of 6 weeks,
with 16 patients receiving cortisone for less than 6 weeks. 25 mg
of cortisone acetate is equivalent to 5 mg of prednisolone.210 The
primary outcome was clinical remission defined as one or two
stools per day with no rectal bleeding.

Efficacy induction: At the end of the induction period, 41.3%
of  patients  randomised  to  cortisone  were  in  remission,  27.5%
improved and 31.2% showed no improvement. Treatment was
effective in initial presentations and relapses of existing disease.
Please see table 7 for estimated time to treatment goals for oral
corticosteroids.

Certainty and rationale: In a meta- analysis of five randomised
controlled  trials,  corticosteroids  were  superior  to  placebo  for
inducing remission in ulcerative colitis (RR of no remission 0.65;
95% CI 0.45 to 0.93).211 Although uncertainty exists regarding
the  optimal  dose  and  regimen  for  systemic  corticosteroids  in
ulcerative colitis, a 40 mg/day dose of prednisolone was found

Prednisolone is recommended for induction of remission in
moderate to severe ulcerative colitis

Recommendation: strong. Overall certainty: very low. Overall
magnitude: not available.
Justification: Despite the relative lack of robust trial evidence,
with just two RCTs,290 287 768 prednisolone has been extensively
used in the clinical management of ulcerative colitis flares. Its
efficacy in inducing remission and ameliorating symptoms is
well- documented in clinical practice. Prednisolone may be used
as a step- down therapy following response to initial intravenous
corticosteroids, or as an addition to current ulcerative colitis
therapy in the presence of inflammation. The GDG therefore
made a strong recommendation in the absence of these RCT
data using the expert consensus approach.

Owing to a lack of trial data, the optimal prednisolone dosing

regimen is not validated, but a commonly uses regimen is a
starting dose of 40 mg daily followed by dose reduction of
ulcerative colitis 5 mg per week to 0 mg.

Implementation considerations: Systemic corticosteroid
treatment is associated with adverse effects, including
immunosuppression, osteoporosis, glucose intolerance and mood
disturbances. Tailored prednisolone weaning protocols may be
required depending on comorbidities (such as diabetes, mental
health issues, adrenal suppression) and experienced adverse
effects (such as glucose intolerance, mood changes, sleep
disturbances). Once- daily prednisolone dosing is recommended,
preferably in the morning and with food to prevent sleep
disturbances and mitigate dyspepsia. Calcium and vitamin D
supplementation are recommended for bone protection unless
contraindicated, and in those over 65 years risk of fracture
should be estimated and oral bisphosphonate considered.769
For dyspepsia, concomitant supportive therapies can be started,
such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) unless contraindicated.

to be more effective than a 20 mg/day dose. Evidence suggests
no  additional  benefit  with  doses  higher  than  40–60  mg/day,
with potential for increased adverse effects. The regimen should
be  tailored  based  on  individual  patient  factors,  with  careful

Beclomethasone dipropionate is suggested for induction of
remission in patients with ulcerative colitis where 5- ASA therapy
fails or is not tolerated, and who wish to avoid more potent
systemic corticosteroids.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Small.

Justification: The use of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) in
the clinical management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis,
is based on the evidence from five RCTs. Beclomethasone has
potent topical effect, with high first- pass metabolism, therefore,
considered low risk compared with conventional corticosteroids.
Its efficacy in inducing remission and ameliorating symptoms is
modest compared with placebo, and similar to 5- ASA.

Implementation considerations: 5 mg/day prolonged release
tablet once a day for 4 weeks was most commonly assessed
dosing schedule in clinical trial GRADE statements, and there
was no difference between 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day doses.
Therefore 5 mg/day dosing schedule is recommended.

consideration given to minimising adverse effects and ensuring a
gradual tapering schedule to optimise outcomes.

GRADE statement: Beclomethasone dipropionate
Summary of evidence: There are four RCTs comparing BDP with
placebo or 5- ASAs available, and one RCT comparing BDP and
prednisone in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis for induction
of  clinical  and  endoscopic  outcomes.  A  recent  meta- analysis
summarised  available  evidence  on  efficacy  and  safety  of  BDP
compared with placebo or 5- ASAs.212

Efficacy  induction:  On  analysis,  both  BDP  5  mg  (OR2.36,
95% CI 1.37 to 4.08) and BDP 10 mg (OR=2.23, 95% CI 1.02
to 4.87) were more effective than placebo for inducing clinical
remission or improvement. One trial compared BDP 5 mg with
placebo, demonstrating the superiority of the intervention arm
(OR=2.70, 95% CI 1.28 to 5.67) in inducing endoscopic remis-
sion. No differences were found between 5- ASA and BDP 5 mg
(OR=0.90,  95%  CI  0.51  to  1.57)  or  BDP  10  mg  (OR=1.54,
95% CI 0.42 to 5.64). On analysis of safety outcomes, BDP 5 mg
was not associated with increased adverse events compared with
placebo (OR=0.51, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.24). Similarly, BDP 5 mg
was  not  associated  with  increased  withdrawals  compared  with
placebo  or  budesonide  MMX  or  5- ASA.  One  RCT  compared
efficacy of BDP 5 mg and prednisone in mild to moderate ulcer-
ative colitis, in which 64.6% of patients receiving BDP achieved
response  compared  with  66.2%  with  prednisone  (p=0.78)
at  week  4,  demonstrating  non- inferiority.213  Similar  rates  of
adverse  events  were  observed  with  both  interventions  (38.7%
vs 46.9%, p=0.17).

Efficacy maintenance: No data are available for maintenance

of clinical remission.

Certainty and rationale: Meta- analysis of four RCTs showed
BDP 5 mg is superior to placebo but as effective as 5- ASAs and
there  was  no  difference  between  5  mg  and  10  mg  doses.  All

Budesonide MMX is suggested for the induction of remission in
mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in patients for whom 5- ASA
induction therapy fails or is not tolerated, and who wish to avoid
more potent systemic corticosteroids.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Trivial.

Justification: The overall certainty is moderate for trivial effect
on inducing remission with budesonide MMX versus placebo,
with in subgroup analysis showing higher efficacy in patients
with left- sided disease. The certainty is low for no difference in
efficacy between budesonide MMX and oral 5- ASA. Considering
the favourable adverse effect profile, budesonide MMX is
suggested for induction of remission in patients with mild to
moderate ulcerative colitis, where oral 5- ASA has failed or is not
tolerated, or when more potent systemic corticosteroids should
be avoided.

Implementation considerations: In subgroup analysis, the
efficacy was highest in patients with left- sided disease. The cost
is higher than for 5- ASA, while the efficacy of the two agents
is equal (low certainty). In the UK, access to the treatment
varies by region, with some commissioning groups excluding
budesonide MMX owing to expense and lack of greater
efficacy data. Alternatively, beclomethasone dipropionate can
be used, which has also been shown to be more effective than
placebo.213 770 771

Guidelines

studies assessed in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis for a dura-
tion of 4 weeks. BDP is associated with high first- pass metabo-
lism  and  considered  low  risk.  Available  evidence  suggests  that
BDP 5 mg has similar efficacy to 5- ASA or prednisolone in mild
to  moderate  ulcerative  colitis. Therefore,  can  be  considered  in
the short term to induce clinical remission.

GRADE statement: Budesonide MMX
Summary  of  evidence:  Included  in  the  Cochrane  systematic
review  are  two  RCTs  comparing  budesonide  MMX  9  mg  vs
5- ASA,  and  six  RCTs  comparing  budesonide  MMX  9  mg  vs
placebo.  In  terms  of  achieving  clinical  remission  or  improve-
ment, budesonide MMX 9 mg was more effective than placebo;
Budesonide  MMX  9  mg  daily  was  superior  to  placebo  for
inducing  remission  at  8  weeks.  Fifteen  per  cent  (71/462)  of
patients in the budesonide MMX 9 mg group achieved remission
compared with 7% (30/438) placebo patients (RR2.25, 95% CI
1.50  to  3.39).  Overall,  budesonide  MMX  was  considered  safe
and well tolerated. The GRADE summary of findings is in online
supplemental appendix 4, table 1.

Efficacy  induction:  The  evidence  showed,  with  moderate
certainty, that budesonide MMX has a trivial magnitude of effect
compared  with  placebo  in  induction  of  remission  (combined
clinical and endoscopic). However, there were no differences in
effect when compared with oral 5- ASA therapy.

Efficacy maintenance: No evidence is available.
Certainty  and  rationale:  For  induction  of  clinical  remission,
there  is  low  certainty  for  no  difference  in  efficacy  compared
with oral 5- ASA therapy and moderate certainty that budesonide
MMX has a trivial magnitude of effect compared with placebo.
In  subgroup  analysis  the  efficacy  was  highest  in  patients  with
left- sided  disease.  Budesonide  MMX  has  a  good  safety  profile
and is well tolerated. Budesonide MMX is therefore suggested
for  induction  of  remission  in  patients  with  mild  to  moderate
ulcerative colitis where 5- ASA therapy is ineffective or not toler-
ated, or when systemic corticosteroids are to be avoided.

5-ASA in ulcerative colitis

5-AsaSAs are recommended for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.

Recommendation: Strong. Overall certainty: High. Overall
magnitude: High.

Justification: 5-ASAs are a widely available and generally well
tolerated medication. The choice of 5-ASA should be determined
by local access, disease location, patient preference (eg, tablets
vs granules) and cost. The lowest effective maintenance dose
should be used, and/or topical therapy as appropriate.

In routine practice, 5-ASAs are the entry treatment for mild
to moderate ulcerative colitis. A 5-ASA dose of ≥2 g/day is
recommended to induce and maintain remission in patients with
mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Once-daily adequate dosing
is as effective as divided dose regimens to induce and maintain
remission. Although there is no prospective RCT evidence for
use of high-dose 5-ASA from outset, for patients with more
severe disease or for patients not responding to conventional
doses of 5-ASA (1.5–2.4 g/day depending on formulation) higher
doses (3–4.8 g/day) might be used until remission is induced.
Combining oral and topical 5-ASA to induce remission for active
disease may have better efficacy than monotherapy with oral
5-ASA alone.

GRADE statement: 5-ASAs
Summary  of  evidence:  A  Cochrane  review214  of  induction
remission  included  54  randomised  trials  with  a  total  of  9612
people taking part. Most studies were rated at low risk of bias. A
Cochrane review215 of maintenance identified 44 studies (9967
participants). Most studies were at low risk of bias. Both studies
included only patients with mild to moderate disease (as defined
by Truelove and Witt criteria). The GRADE summary of findings
is in online supplemental appendix 4, table 2.

Efficacy

induction:  The  Cochrane  review  found  71%
(1107/1550) of 5- ASA- exposed participants did not enter clinical
remission compared with 83% (695/837) of placebo participants
(RR0.86,  95%  CI  0.82  to  0.89;  2387  participants,  11  studies;
high‐certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference
in  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  and  serious  adverse  events
between 5- ASA and placebo, once‐daily and conventional doses
of 5- ASA, and 5- ASA and comparator 5- ASA formulation studies.
Common  adverse  events  included  flatulence,  abdominal  pain,
nausea,  diarrhoea,  headache  and  worsening  ulcerative  colitis.
The  Cochrane  review  suggested  that  once- daily  dosing  was  as
effective  as  conventional  dosing  (two  or  three  times  per  day).
Please see table 7 for estimated time to treatment goals for 5ASAs.
Efficacy maintenance: 5- ASAs were found to be more effective
than  placebo  for  maintenance  of  clinical  or  endoscopic  remis-
sion. About 37% (335/907) of 5- ASA participants relapsed at 6
to 12 months compared with 55% (355/648) of placebo partic-
ipants  (RR=0.68,  95%  CI  0.61  to  0.76;  eight  studies,  1555
participants;  high‐certainty  evidence).  The  Cochrane  review
suggested that once- daily dosing was as effective as conventional
dosing (two or three times per day)

It  was  noted  3%  (41/1587)  of  participants  in  the  once‐daily
group experienced a serious adverse effect (SAE) compared with
2% (35/1609) of participants in the conventional‐dose group at
6  to  12  months  (RR=1.20,  95%  CI  0.77  to  1.87;  moderate‐
certainty evidence).

Certainty  and  rationale:  Moderate  to  high  certainty  of
evidence that the magnitude of effect of induction with 5- ASAs is
moderate for clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic
improvement,  while  the  magnitude  of  effect  of  maintenance
with 5- ASAs is moderate for clinical remission and endoscopic
remission. The targeted population receiving this therapy were
patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.

WITHDRAWAL OF 5-ASAS IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS

GPS 33

We suggest that patients with ulcerative colitis who have
achieved prolonged remission and mucosal healing with
biologic agents and/or immunomodulators or JAK inhibitors can
discontinue their 5- ASAs.

GPS 34

We suggest that when monotherapy mesalazine is prescribed
as treatment for ulcerative colitis it may also have a chemo
preventative effect. It is not clear whether there is an additional
chemo preventative effect with mesalazine for patients with
ulcerative colitis receiving advanced therapies, where the
mesalazine is not needed for control of inflammation.

5- ASA  medications  are  typically  used  as  a  first- line  treatment
for  mild  to  moderate  ulcerative  colitis.  More  severe  disease  is
treated with biologic agents, immunomodulators and JAK inhib-
itors.  Several  arguments  support  withdrawal  of  5- ASAs  when
mucosal  healing  is  achieved  with  these  agents.  First,  mucosal
healing suggests effective resolution of underlying inflammation,
mitigating the need for the additional anti- inflammatory effects
of 5- ASA. Second, 5- ASA medications can cause adverse effects
such as gastrointestinal symptoms, allergic reactions and intersti-
tial nephritis. By discontinuing 5- ASAs, risks of side effects and
overall medication burden is reduced for patients. A prospective
randomised  observer- blind  2- year- trial  of  azathioprine  mono-
therapy versus azathioprine and olsalazine for the maintenance
of  remission  of  steroid- dependent  ulcerative  colitis  found  that
the relapse rate in the patients receiving azathioprine alone was
19%, whereas the combination therapy group showed a relapse
rate of 18%, which was not statistically significant. There were
no significant differences between groups in time to relapse or
discontinuation of treatment, clinical activity and quality of life
score. However, the number of adverse events and the treatment
costs  were  significantly  higher,  with  poorer  treatment  compli-
ance in the combination therapy.216

A  pooled  analysis  of  individual  participant  data  from  clin-
ical  trials  found  no  benefit  of  concomitant  5- ASA  in  patients
with  moderate  to  severe  ulcerative  colitis  escalated  to  biologic
therapy. A total of 2183 patients were treated with infliximab or
golimumab. Concomitant use of 5- ASA was not associated with
odds  of  achieving  clinical  remission  (adjusted  OR=0.67  (95%
CI 0.45 to 1.01), p=0.06), clinical response (aOR=0.89 (95%
CI 0.60 to 1.33), p=0.58) or mucosal healing (aOR=1.12 (95%
CI 0.82 to 1.51), p=0.48).217

An  analysis  of  two  nationwide  population- based  cohorts
compared  clinical  outcomes  in  3589  patients  with  ulcerative
colitis already receiving 5- ASA, who started anti- TNF and then
either stopped or continued 5- ASA. The authors found that stop-
ping 5- ASA after initiating anti- TNF was not associated with an
increased  risk  of  adverse  clinical  events  (aHR=1.04  (95%  CI
0.90  to  1.21),  p=0.57)  in  the  US  population  and  aHR=1.09
(95% CI 0.80 to 1.49), p=0.60).218 Similarly, a further nation-
wide  population- based  study  of  2963  patients  with  ulcerative
colitis from Korea demonstrated that discontinuation of 5- ASA
after  initiating  anti  TNF  was  not  associated  with  adverse  clin-
ical events, including intestinal surgery, hospitalisation and new
corticosteroid  use  (aHR=0.996  (95%  CI  0.85  to  1.16)).219

IMMUNOMODULATORS IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS
GRADE statement: Methotrexate
Summary  of  evidence:  Two  studies  (n=101  patients)  were
included  in  the  most  recent  Cochrane  review.220  One  study
(n=67)  compared  oral  methotrexate  (12.5  mg/week)  with
placebo.  The  other  study  (n=32)  compared  oral  methotrexate
(15 mg/week) with mercaptopurine (1.5 mg/kg/day) and 5‐ASA
(3 g/day). The placebo‐controlled study was judged to be at low
risk  of  bias.  The  other  study  was  judged  to  be  at  high  risk  of
bias  due  to  an  open‐label  design.221  The  GRADE  summary  of
findings is in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 3.
Efficacy induction: There was no statistically significant differ-
ence in clinical remission rates between patients receiving meth-
otrexate and those receiving a placebo (RR=1.19, 95% CI 0.72
to 1.96). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of
the evidence supporting this outcome was low due to very sparse
data (32 events).

Methotrexate is not suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Trivial.

Justification: Although methotrexate was tolerated, the
studies showed no benefit for methotrexate over placebo
for induction of remission in ulcerative colitis. The results for
efficacy outcomes between methotrexate and placebo are of low
certainty.220

Implementation considerations: For patients already
receiving methotrexate as monotherapy in this context, a
discussion should be held to reach a shared decision before
any change in therapy is made. Methotrexate may continue
to have a role in combination with an anti- TNFα monoclonal
antibody in reducing immunogenicity in those patients who have
contraindications or are intolerant to a purine analogue. Female
patients of childbearing age should be advised about the risk of
teratogenicity when prescribed methotrexate and advised to use
suitable contraception.220

Efficacy  maintenance:  There  was  no  statistically  significant
difference in the proportion of patients who maintained remis-
sion (RR=1.06; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.43). A GRADE analysis indi-
cated that the quality of evidence is low due to very sparse data.
Certainty and rationale: There may be no difference between
methotrexate  and  placebo  in  the  induction  and  maintenance
of  remission  of  ulcerative  colitis  (low  certainty),  so  its  use  as
monotherapy in ulcerative colitis is not recommended. As a cost-
effective,  widely  available  drug,  and  generally  well  tolerated,
particularly  when  used  in  subcutaneous  form,  methotrexate
(10–12.5 mg/week)222 may have a role as an immunomodulator
to  reduce  immunogenicity  of  anti- TNF  therapies.  There  are
even  fewer  data  sources  to  assess  this,  as  purine  analogues  are
more widely used as first- line immunomodulator therapy, with
a switch to methotrexate if appropriate when purine analogues
are not tolerated or contraindicated. Methotrexate is contrain-
dicated for women who are actively family planning due to the
very high risk of miscarriage and teratogenicity.

The  GDG  supports  individualised  patient  discussion  for
patients  currently  established  on  methotrexate,  and  consider-
ation of planned withdrawal as remission may be spontaneously
maintained with 5- ASA monotherapy.

GRADE STATEMENT: PURINE ANALOGUES
Summary of evidence: The evidence for induction is limited with
a  review  including  four  RCT,s  all  more  than  20  years  old.  A
Cochrane review for maintenance included seven RCTs with 302
patients with risk of bias high in three studies.223 The GRADE
summary  of  findings  is  in  online  supplemental  appendix  4,
GRADE table 4.

Efficacy induction: Meta- analysis224 did not allow any conclu-
sions  to  be  drawn  (RR1.59,  95%  CI  0.59  to  4.29,  very  low
certainty,  downgraded  owing  to  very  serious  concerns  with
imprecision, heterogeneity and risk of bias).

Efficacy maintenance: Purine analogues may be more effective
at maintaining remission, with 51/115 patients exposed to purine
analogues failing to maintain remission compared with 76/117
placebo patients (four studies, 232 patients; RR=0.68, 95% CI
0.54  to  0.86,  low  due  to  risk  of  bias  and  imprecision  (sparse

maintenance.

 ⇒ Justification: The overall certainty is low, for no benefit
in induction and a moderate magnitude benefit for
maintenance of remission. Purine analogues are inexpensive,
widely available, once established can be prescribed by
general practice and generally well tolerated, with extensive
real- world experience 0f their use.

 ⇒ Implementation consideration: Purine analogues have
slow onset of action and require a bridging agent, usually
corticosteroids. There is a significant intolerance rate, including
pancreatitis. There is also significant risk of myelosuppression,
and frequent blood test monitoring including for individualised
dose optimisation, is required. Increased risk of malignancy
with long- term use requires shared decision- making regarding
duration of use, and clearly this must consider the risks with
alternative therapies in a balanced fashion. Purine analogues
may play a role as concomitant medication with anti- TNFs to
prevent immunogenicity and may be given with allopurinol in
cases of toxicity.541225

data)).  Adverse  events  related  to  study  medication  included
acute pancreatitis (three cases, plus one case on ciclosporin) and
significant bone marrow suppression (five cases). Please see table
7 for estimated time to treatment goals for purine analogues.

Certainty  and  rationale:  There  is  low  certainty  that  purine
analogues  are  no  better  than  placebo  at  induction  of  remis-
sion in ulcerative colitis. There is low certainty with a trivial to
moderate magnitude that purine analogues may be better than
placebo at maintenance of clinical remission, where a bridging
agent has induced remission.

Purine  analogues  are  cost- effective,  widely  available,  once
established may be prescribed by general practice and generally
well  tolerated,  with  extensive  real- world  experience.  Despite
attempts  to  reduce  risk  by  pre- emptive  TPMT±NUDT15
testing,  when  they  occur,  significant  side  effects,  although
rare,  may  cause  significant  morbidity,  such  as  pancreatitis  and
increased risk of malignancy, which are pertinent to our ageing
and comorbid patient populations.

Monitoring  for  purine  analogues  should  be  continued
throughout use, as the risk of hepatotoxicity and myelosuppres-
sion  persists,  particularly  in  patients  with  polypharmacy.  The
use  of  purine  analogue  metabolite  monitoring  for  individual-
ised dose optimisation is encouraged, particularly when co- pre-
scribed with allopurinol.

The  duration  of  a  clinical  trial  follow- up  is  not  sufficient  to
capture  longer- term  risks  associated  with  purine  analogues,
including malignancy. For this reason, real- world data have been
evaluated to assess the long- term safety of thiopurine use.

A meta- analysis of two prospective and two retrospective large
observational cohorts, comprising 61 794 patients who received
purine  analogues  compared  with  165  867  unexposed,  demon-
strated pooled incident rate ratio (IRR) (per 1000 patient- years)
of lymphoma to be 2.23 (95% CI 1.79 to 2.79; p<0.001) with
purine analogue exposure.225 A French nationwide cohort study,
including 50 405 patients exposed to purine analogues, with a
median follow- up of 6.7 years, yielded an adjusted hazard ratio

(aHR) for lymphoma of 2.60 (95% CI 1.96 to 3.44; p<0.001).166
A second meta- analysis identified 18 relevant studies and calcu-
lated  a  standardised  incidence  ratio  (SIR)  of  lymphoma  to  be
2.80  (95%  CI  1.82  to  4.32)  in  eight  population  studies  and
9.24 (95% CI 4.69 to 18.2) in 10 referral studies.226 This study
also  demonstrated  the  highest  relative  risk  in  men  under  30
(SIR=6.99; 95% CI 2.99 to 16.4), but the highest absolute risk
in  patients  over  50  years  of  age  (1:354  cases  per  patient- year,
with a relative risk of 4.78). In addition to lymphoproliferative
disorders, purine analogues have been associated with increased
incidence  of  urinary  tract  cancer  and  non- melanomatous  skin
cancer.179  227–229  Meta- analysis  and  systematic  review  of  13
studies and 149 198 participants revealed relative risk (RR) of
non- melanoma skin cancer associated with purine analogue use
to be 1.88 (95% CI 1.48 to 2.38, p<0.001).230

The slow onset of action and risks of side effects are reflected
by  common  practice,  where  it  is  used  as  dual  therapy  as  an
exit strategy for maintenance after induction of remission with
corticosteroids or other agents, or maintenance of remission in
those with a high risk of relapse. The duration of use of purine
analogues  needs  to  be  determined  by  individualised  shared
decision- making to ensure benefits continue to outweigh cumu-
lative risks. The role for purine analogues to reduce immunoge-
nicity risk when used in combination therapy with biologics is
considered in other sections.

Withdrawal of purine analogue therapy in ulcerative colitis

GPS 35

Withdrawal of purine analogues as monotherapy or combination
therapy in ulcerative colitis is associated with a risk of relapse.
Shared decision- making should be undertaken in the light of
the long- term risks of continuing purine analogues, including
elevated risk of lymphoproliferative disorders, non- melanoma
skin cancers, myeloid disorders and urinary tract cancers.

A historical RCT study in 1992231 assessed withdrawal of azathi-
oprine  monotherapy  in  ulcerative  colitis,  wherein  79  patients
with  ulcerative  colitis  treated  with  azathioprine  for  at  least  6
months  were  randomised  to  placebo  or  azathioprine.  Patients
in  remission  for  2  months  or  more  and  patients  with  chronic
or  steroid- dependent  disease  were  randomised  separately.  In
the  remission  group  (n=67),  35%  of  the  azathioprine  group
relapsed at 1 year versus 59% in the placebo group, (p=0.01).
Subgroup  analysis  of  patients  (n=54)  who  had  been  in  more
prolonged remission (> 6 months) identified 31% relapse in the
azathioprine group versus 61% in the placebo group at 1 year,
demonstrating  that  continuing  treatment  in  those  in  remission
has  benefit.  Within  the  smaller  chronic  or  steroid-  dependent
group (n=12), no benefit was found in continuing azathioprine
treatment.

A  2015  systematic  review232  summarised  the  published  data
on  purine  analogues  withdrawal  for  patients  in  clinical  remis-
sion.  Relapse  rates  were  higher  among  patients  randomised  to
withdrawal  at  12  months;  relapse  rates  ranged  from  11%  to
77%.

An open- label,233 prospective and randomised clinical trial in
a population of 81 patients receiving azathioprine combination
therapy  for  ulcerative  colitis  or  Crohn’s  disease  compared  the
effects  of  azathioprine  withdrawal  on  durable  remission  of  at
least  6  months  (36  with  ulcerative  colitis).  Three  groups  were

randomised to steady- dose azathioprine versus half- dose azathi-
oprine versus azathioprine withdrawal. At 1 year the ulcerative
colitis  subgroup  showed  no  significant  difference  between  the
groups  with  regard  to  clinical  outcome,  with  a  Mayo  subscore
equivalent  across  the  three  groups  (p=0.25).  However,  the
azathioprine half- dose group had higher infliximab trough levels
and lower antibody formation rates than the azathioprine with-
drawal group, suggesting some benefit from combination therapy.

ADVANCED THERAPIES IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS
GRADE statement: Infliximab
Summary of evidence: The two RCTs236 are subject to concerns
over the outcome measurement timing. Maintenance data could
not  be  included  in  the  network  meta-analyses  (NMA)  because
week 30 and 54 study phases were treat- through design, whereas
the  datasets  for  the  maintenance  NMA  were  acquired  from
re- randomised maintenance studies.236 The average proportion
of patients receiving concomitant immunomodulators was 46%
(42–55% in the different study arms). The GRADE summary of
findings is in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 5.

Efficacy  induction:  The  two  RCTs  included  a  total  of  728
participants  receiving  infliximab  5  mg/kg  (n=242),  infliximab
10  mg/kg  (n=242),  or  placebo  (n=124).236  All  patients  were
biologic- naive.  At  week  8,  clinical  remission  rates  in  patients
receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg were 39% and 34%
(vs 15% and 6% for placebo, respectively). Clinical response in
patients  receiving  infliximab  5  mg/kg  and  10  mg/kg  was  69%
and 64% (vs 37% and 29% placebo, respectively; p<0.001 for
both  comparisons).  Endoscopic  remission  rates  for  infliximab
5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg were 62% and 60% (vs 34% and 31%
placebo),  respectively.  Please  see  table  7  for  estimated  time  to
treatment goals for infliximab.

Infliximab is suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative
colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Small.

Justification: The recommendation is made based on the NMA
for induction, RCT data and extensive clinician experience from
widespread use. Maintenance NMA data are lacking, as the
ACT2 treat- through trial could not be included in our analyses,
but this is a widely used biologic agent with extensive clinician
experience from widespread use.

Implementation considerations: Most data are derived from
dosing at 5 mg/kg. Evidence is of very low and low certainty
for 10 mg/kg due to imprecision, but the magnitude is similar.
RCT data of escalation of dosing are not available, but this is
common practice. As such, this can be considered as part of
shared decision- making when considering response to 5 mg/kg
is ineffective or in cases of severe disease. It is common practice
to concomitantly treat with an immunomodulator. at least until
remission has been achieved.

Subcutaneous infliximab for maintenance can be used instead
of intravenous infusions. In an open- label, randomised study the
efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity outcomes did not differ
between patients with IBD patients receiving intravenous versus
subcutaneous biosimilar infliximab.234 Subcutaneous injections
are well accepted by patients and have resource advantages.235

In the NMA, the certainty was moderate for a small benefit
in  clinical  remission,  the  certainty  was  high  for  a  moderate
benefit for clinic response and the certainty was moderate for a
moderate benefit for endoscopic improvement with infliximab 5
mg/kg over placebo.

Efficacy  maintenance:  The  ACT  1  study  randomised  364
patients  to  receive  placebo  (n=121),  5  mg/kg  of  infliximab
(n=121)  or  10  mg/kg  of  infliximab  (n=122).  For  the  5  mg/
kg  dose,  the  week  54  sustained  response  rate  was  39%  (14%
placebo) and sustained remission rate 20% (6% placebo).236

Certainty and rationale: The NMA data show, with moderate
certainty,  that  infliximab  has  small  efficacy  for  induction  of
remission  in  ulcerative  colitis.  After  considering  maintenance
data from RCTs and extensive clinical experience, infliximab is
suggested for induction and maintenance of remission in patients
with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Superiority of inflix-
imab  10  mg/kg  over  5  mg/kg  in  the  two  RCTs  and  the  NMA
was not demonstrated. However, in these studies, patient selec-
tion  for  the  10  mg/kg  was  random,  unlike  in  clinical  practice
where  decision- making  for  dose  escalation  is  guided  by  a  lack
of  optimal  response  and/or  therapeutic  drug  monitoring.  This
approach  is  embedded  in  routine  clinical  practice  and  thus  is
supported by the GDG.

As  with  purine  analogues,  risks  of  infliximab  monotherapy
may extend beyond the trial study period, with systematic review
and meta- analysis of real world data largely combining anti- TNF
therapy for analysis. The systematic review with meta- analysis of
Chupin et al, which included 261 689 patients with IBD from
four  high- quality  observational  studies,  demonstrated  that  the
pooled  IRR  (per  1000  patient- years)  of  lymphoma  in  patients
receiving anti- TNF monotherapy was 2.23 (95% CI 1.79 to 2.79;
p<0.001), statistically comparable with those exposed to thio-
purine (pooled IRR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.48 to 1.07; p=0.107).225
These findings were consistent with an earlier meta- analysis of
26 studies, comprising over 21 178 years of patient follow- up.237
A French National cohort study also found an increased risk of
lymphoma with exposure to anti- TNF monotherapy, aHR=2.41
(95%  CI  1.60  to  3.64).166  However,  interpretation  of  magni-
tude of risk from real- world data is challenging, as many patients
included within the meta- analyses were exposed to thiopurines
prior to receiving anti- TNF.

Associations  between  anti- TNF  therapy  and  melanoma  from
real- world  data  have  been  identified,  but  are  inconsistent.  A
large case- control study of 10 879 patients with IBD receiving
either  anti- TNF  or  natalizumab  demonstrated  an  association
with melanoma in Crohn’s disease (OR=1.94 (95% CI 1.03 to
3.68), but this did not reach significance in ulcerative colitis.180
However, this finding has not been replicated in other studies,
with a meta- analyses published in 2020, including 7901 patients
receiving anti- TNF, failing to demonstrate a significant associa-
tion, pooled RR (pRR) 1.20 (95% CI 0.60 to 2.40).238

GRADE STATEMENT: GOLIMUMAB
Summary of evidence: Only one study was included in the NMA
for the induction of remission in ulcerative colitis.239 There are
some  concerns  with  the  reporting  of  this  study  in  relation  to
the  measurement  of  outcomes.  There  are  no  further  concerns
with  risk  of  bias.  Two  studies  were  included  in  the  NMA  for
the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis. One enrolled
treatment- responders  from  the  induction  study240;  the  second,
was  a  maintenance  study  in  Japan  following  open- label  induc-
tion.241 There are some concerns regarding the risk of bias due
to measurement of outcomes, for both maintenance studies. The

Guidelines

Golimumab is suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative
colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Small.

Justification: The overall certainty is low, for small magnitude
of effects in induction and maintenance over placebo. There are
no unfavourable safety outcomes.

Implementation considerations: The NMA evidence is
very uncertain regarding the safety outcomes for golimumab
compared with placebo, but other medications are widely
available, low safety risk and used frequently in real- world
practice, provided that best practice baseline screening
procedures are undertaken.

GRADE summary of findings is in online supplemental appendix
4, GRADE table 6.

Efficacy induction: This study included a total of 516 partici-
pants, 258 participants were randomised to golimumab therapy
while 258 were randomised to placebo. Nearly a third (29.5%)
of participants were co- prescribed immunomodulator therapy.

Efficacy maintenance: There were data from 527 participants
in  total,  with  up  to  31%240  and  50%241  of  participants  taking
concurrent immunomodulator therapy in the two studies.

Certainty and rationale: Based on one study included in the
NMA for induction and two studies for maintenance, the overall
certainty of the efficacy outcomes for induction and maintenance
were low. The overall magnitude of effect was small. Although
of very low certainty, the favourable safety outcomes (no differ-
ence compared with placebo) and clinician experience from use
of anti- TNFs, make golimumab a suitable option for moderate
to severe ulcerative colitis. However, lack of long- term studies
to  demonstrate  efficacy  and  safety  should  be  considered  when
deciding on this therapy.

GRADE STATEMENT: ADALIMUMAB
Summary of evidence: Four RCTs were included in the NMA, with
a total of 1917 participants. The average proportion of patients
receiving concomitant immunomodulators was 40.7% (24–59%).
There were some concerns over measurement of the outcomes in
one study242 and over missing outcomes data in a second study.242
No maintenance data could be included in the NMA because the
maintenance studies ULTRA 2243 maintenance arm and a separate
phase II/III Japanese study242 were treat- through studies, whereas
the datasets for the maintenance NMA were acquired from re- ran-
domised  maintenance  studies  The  SERENE  ulcerative  colitis
study244 compared higher versus standard induction and did not
have a placebo arm. The GRADE summary of findings is in online
supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 7.

Efficacy induction: In NMA the certainty was low for a trivial
benefit  for  clinical  remission,  clinical  response  and  endoscopic
improvement with induction with standard dosing adalimumab
(160/80 mg at week 0 and 2 then 40 mg every other week) over
placebo. For the higher induction dosing of 160 mg at weeks 0,
1, 2, and 3; then 40 mg at weeks 4 and 6, the certainty was low
for  a  small  benefit  for  clinical  response  at  week  8.  The  other
outcomes  were  no  different  from  standard  dosing.  Please  see
table 7 for estimated time to treatment goals for adalimumab.

Guidelines

Adalimumab is not suggested for induction and
maintenance of remission in patients with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Trivial.

Justification: The magnitude of effect of induction with
standard dose adalimumab is trivial for clinical response, clinical
remission and endoscopic improvement. Because treatments
with higher magnitude of effect are available, adalimumab is not
suggested as standard treatment for induction of remission in
moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Implementation considerations: Adalimumab has a low- risk
safety profile, is easily available and has been widely used by
clinicians. Patients already receiving adalimumab should not
have their treatment stopped, but a discussion with shared
decision- making should be undertaken before any changes are
made. Additionally, there may be situations where adalimumab
may be considered, such as access issues, patient choice, mixed
disease phenotype, including extraintestinal manifestations, or
multiple immune- mediated diseases necessitating adalimumab
treatment.

Efficacy maintenance: In the ULTRA 2 study,243 adalimumab
40 mg every other week after standard induction, was assessed
at weeks 8 and 52. The efficacy for clinical remission was trivial
(17.5% vs 8.5% for placebo, delta 8.8%); this was slightly higher
in anti- TNF naive participants (22% vs 12% for placebo, delta
10%)  and  lower  in  anti- TNF  exposed  patients  (week  52  clin-
ical  remission  10.2%  vs  3%  for  placebo,  delta  7.2%).  In  the
VARSITY  study245;  vedolizumab  300  mg  at  weeks  0,  2  and  6
and then every 8 weeks versus adalimumab subcutaneously 160
mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2 and then 40 mg fortnightly, was
assessed.  At  52  weeks,  clinical  remission  rates  were  31.3%  for
vedolizumab versus 22.5% for adalimumab- treated participants.
Certainty  and  rationale:  The  NMA  data  show  with  low
certainty  that  adalimumab  has  trivial  efficacy  for  induction
of  remission  in  ulcerative  colitis.  RCT  data  show  this  is  not
improved  by  higher  than  standard  dosing.244  Given  that  there
are  other  agents  available  with  higher  efficacy,  adalimumab  is
not suggested as standard treatment for induction of remission
in ulcerative colitis, yet may be appropriate in selected patients,
such as those with extraintestinal manifestations and or multiple
immune- mediated diseases necessitating adalimumab treatment.

WITHDRAWAL OF ANTI-TNF IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS

GPS 36

Patients with ulcerative colitis considering withdrawal of
anti- TNF therapy should be counselled that even with at least
6 months corticosteroid- free clinical remission and mucosal
healing (defined as a MES 0–1), anti- TNF withdrawal is
associated with an increased risk of relapse in approximately
one in two patients in the first year.

Patients with ulcerative colitis receiving anti- TNF therapy, should
not be considered for therapy withdrawal, as there is an elevated
risk of relapse of approximately one in two patients in the first

year. One RCT compared patient outcomes between infliximab
maintenance and infliximab discontinuation in ulcerative colitis
(Koyabashi et al).246 In tht study, patients in corticosteroid- free
remission  for  more  than  6  months,  with  a  Mayo  Endoscopic
Subscore  of  0  or  1  were  randomised  to  either  continuing  or
discontinuing infliximab. At week 48, 37 of 46 (80% (95% CI
66∙1% to 90∙6%)) in the group continuing infliximab compared
with 25 of 46 patients (54% (95% CI 39∙0% to 69∙1%)) in the
group  discontinuing  infliximab  were  in  remission,  p=0∙0059.
In the group discontinuing infliximab who were re- treated with
infliximab after relapsing, 67% (8 of 12 patients) were in remis-
sion within 8 weeks of re- treatment with no infusion reactions.
Subgroup  analysis  identified  that  baseline  immunomodulator
and  5- ASA  therapy  did  not  provide  protection  from  a  relapse
following infliximab discontinuation.

There is limited evidence on clinical predictors of relapse after
withdrawal,  although  histological  evidence  of  inflammation
(defined as a Nancy score of >1) and a raised CRP at the time
of  infliximab  withdrawal  are  associated  with  an  increased  risk
of relapse.

GRADE STATEMENT: OZANIMOD
Summary  of  evidence:  One  phase  III  study  of  ozanimod  for
induction  and  maintenance  therapy  was  included  for  analyses
in the NMA,247 with a total of 645 patients randomised versus
placebo for the induction study, and 457 ozanimod responders
randomised  versus  placebo  for  the  maintenance  study.  No
patients were receiving concomitant immunomodulator therapy.
Low  risk  of  bias  was  observed  for  both  studies.  The  GRADE
summary  of  findings  is  in  online  supplemental  appendix  4,
GRADE table 8.

Efficacy  induction:  There  were  two  cohorts  in  the  induc-
tion study. In the first cohort patients were assigned to receive
oral  ozanimod  hydrochloride  at  a  dose  of  1  mg  (equivalent  to
0.92 mg of ozanimod) (n=429) or placebo (n=216) once daily.
Participants in a second cohort received open- label ozanimod at
the same daily dose (n=367).

Efficacy  maintenance:  Patients  experiencing  clinical  response
to ozanimod at 10 weeks in either induction cohort underwent
re- randomization to receive double- blind ozanimod (n=230) or
placebo (n=227) for the maintenance period through to week 52.
Certainty  and  rationale:  Based  on  a  single  phase  III  study
included  in  the  NMA,  the  overall  certainty  of  the  efficacy
outcomes  for  induction  and  maintenance  were  moderate.
The  overall  magnitude  of  effect  was  moderate.  Low- quality



















Ozanimod is suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative
colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Moderate.

Justification: The evidence is of moderate certainty, with a
moderate magnitude of effect. No unfavourable outcomes

Implementation considerations: This is a newly licensed
medication with limited long- term safety data. At the time of
writing, NICE guidance limits it use to cases where previous
exposure to anti- TNF therapy has failed to induce remission, or
if anti- TNF therapy is clinically contraindicated. Long- term safety
monitoring is proposed.

evidence  suggested  no  evidence  of  differences  in  safety
outcomes  from  placebo,  apart  from  treatment  adverse  event
(TAE)  during  the  maintenance  phase,  which  showed  a  large
effect  of  ozanimod.  The  favourable  efficacy  outcomes,
combined  with  safety  outcomes,  make  ozanimod  a  suitable
option for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

GRADE STATEMENT: ETRASIMOD
Summary of evidence: Two phase III RCTs, including 787 partic-
ipants contributed to the NMA. In both the ELEVATE ulcerative
colitis  52  studies  and  ELEVATE  ulcerative  colitis  12  studies,
patients  were  randomised  to  etrasimod  versus  placebo.248  In
ELEVATE  ulcerative  colitis  52,  289  patients  were  assigned  to
etrasimod  and  144  to  placebo,  while  in  ELEVATE  ulcerative
colitis 12, 238 patients were assigned to etrasimod and 116 to
placebo. The GRADE summary of findings is in online supple-
mental appendix 4, GRADE table 9.

Efficacy induction: Clinical remission at week 12 was achieved
in  27%  of  etrasimod- treated  patients  in  ELEVATE  ulcerative
colitis 52, vs 7% placebo, and in 25% patients of etrasimod- treated
patients vs 15% placebo in ELEVATE ulcerative colitis 12. Please
see table 7 for estimated time to treatment goals for etrasimod.

Adverse  events  were  reported  in  71%  of  etrasimod  patients
and 56% of placebo patients in ELEVATE ulcerative colitis 52,
and in 47% of etrasimod patients and 47% of placebo patients
in ELEVATE ulcerative colitis 12. In the NMA, the certainty was
low  for  a  trivial  benefit  for  clinical  remission  with  etrasimod
over  placebo.  The  certainty  was  moderate  for  both  a  small
benefit  for  clinical  response  and  a  moderate  benefit  for  endo-
scopic improvement.

Efficacy  maintenance:  In  ELEVATE  ulcerative  colitis  52,
patients were treated from randomisation through to week 52.
Clinical remission was 32% in etrasimod- treated patients versus
7% placebo. This study was not included in the NMA owing to
the treat- through design.

Certainty  and  rationale:  Based  on  two  phase  III  studies
included  in  the  NMA,  the  overall  certainty  of  the  efficacy
outcomes  was  moderate.  The  overall  magnitude  of  effect
was  small.  Low  to  moderate  quality  evidence  suggested  no
evidence  of  differences  in  safety  from  placebo.  The  favour-
able efficacy outcomes, combined with safety outcomes make
etrasimod a suitable option for moderate to severe ulcerative
colitis.

Etrasimod is suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative
colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Small.

Justification: There is moderate quality of evidence for
induction and only direct maintenance data available.

Implementation considerations: No published maintenance
data could be included in the NMA as the RCT was treat-
through, but given the results from maintenance data, the GDG
would support its use for maintenance in induction responders.
Long- term safety monitoring is proposed. NICE application for
approval is also currently ongoing at the time of writing this
guideline.

Guidelines

GRADE STATEMENT: TOFACITINIB
Summary  of  evidence:  Three  phase  III  RCTs  contributed  data
to  our  NMA.250  The  OCTAVE  Induction  1  and  2  induction
trials included 598 and 541 patients, respectively. The OCTAVE
sustain  study  included  593  responders  from  the  induction
studies.249 The GRADE summary of findings is in online supple-
mental appendix 4, GRADE table 10.

Efficacy  induction:  Participants  were  randomly  allocated
to  receive  either  tofacitinib  10  mg  twice  daily  (OCTAVE  1
n=476, OCTAVE 2 n=429) or placebo (OCTAVE 1 n=122,
OCTAVE  2  n=112).  There  are  no  significant  concerns  with
risk of bias. Please see table 7 for estimated time to treatment
goals for tofacitinib.

Efficacy maintenance: In OCTAVE Sustain trial, patients were
allocated to tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily (n=198), tofacitinib 5
mg twice daily (n=197) or placebo (n=198). There were some
concerns  with  missing  outcome  data  reporting;  there  are  no
further concerns in relation to risk of bias.

Certainty and rationale: There is low to moderate certainty for
a small to moderate benefit for inducing remission with tofaci-
tinib  over  placebo.  There  is  high  certainty  for  a  large  benefit
for maintaining remission with tofacitinib 5 mg and tofacitinib
10 mg, over placebo. Data from its use in rheumatoid arthritis
raised  safety  concerns  regarding  VTE  particularly  PE,  MACE
and  malignancy  and  tofacitinib  should  only  be  used  in  these
patients if no further options are available. It should be avoided
during pregnancy and lactation.

Tofacitinib is suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative
colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Large.

Justification: In the NMA there is moderate to high
certainty overall, for large effect in re- randomised responders.
The safety data from the NMA for the use of tofacitinib
in ulcerative colitis does not corroborate safety data from
tofacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis, which showed increased risk
of serious side effects.

Implementation considerations: The ORAL surveillance
study183 randomised patients with rheumatoid arthritis, aged
over 50 and with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, to
receive tofacitinib versus anti- TNF therapy and found that
several adverse events, including major adverse cardiac events
(MACE) and cancer, were more common with tofacitinib. The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) cautions that JAK inhibitors
should be used in the following patients only if no suitable
treatment alternatives are available: those aged 65 years or
above, those at increased risk of major cardiovascular problems
(such as heart attack or stroke), those who smoke or have done
so for a long time in the past and those at increased risk of
cancer. JAK inhibitors should be used with caution in patients
with risk factors for blood clots in the lungs and in deep veins
(venous thromboembolism, VTE), other than those listed above.
Furthermore, the doses should be reduced in patient groups
who are at risk of VTE, cancer or major cardiovascular problems,
where possible.249

GRADE STATEMENT: UPADACITINIB
Summary  of  evidence:  Data  were  included  from  a  multi-
centre,  randomised,  double- blind,  placebo- controlled  clinical
programme that consisted of two induction studies (U- ACHIEVE
induction  and  U- ACCOMPLISH)  and  a  single  maintenance
study (U- ACHIEVE maintenance).251 There were no significant
concerns with risk of bias for any of the included studies. The
GRADE summary of findings is in online supplemental appendix
4, GRADE table 11.

Efficacy  induction:  In  U- ACHIEVE,  474  patients  were
randomly  assigned  to  upadacitinib  45  mg  once  daily  (n=319)
or  placebo  (n=155).  In  U- ACCOMPLISH,  522  patients  were
randomly assigned to upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (n=345) or
placebo (n=177). Please see table 7 for estimated time to treat-
ment goals for upadacitinib.

Efficacy maintenance: In the U- ACHIEVE maintenance study
a total of 451 patients (21 from the phase IIb study, 278 from
U- ACHIEVE induction, and 152 from U- ACCOMPLISH), who
achieved a clinical response after 8 weeks of upadacitinib induc-
tion treatment, were randomly assigned to upadacitinib 15 mg
(n=148), upadacitinib 30 mg (n=154), or placebo (n=149) in
the primary analysis population.

Certainty and rationale: The overall certainty is high for a large
benefit for induction and maintenance of remission of moderate
to  severe  ulcerative  colitis  with  upadacitinib  over  placebo.
The  benefit  extended  to  patients  with  previous  biologic  expo-
sure.  Data  regarding  side  effects  are  of  low  certainty,  showing
no difference from placebo. There is a lack of long- term safety
data, and general precautions regarding JAK inhibitors should be
applied regarding risk of hyperlipidaemia, pregnancy, lactation,
infections, cardio- vascular and thrombotic events.

Upadacitinib is recommended for induction and
maintenance of remission in patients with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: High. Overall
magnitude: Large.

Justification: The NMA evidence supports this recommendation
with high certainty. There is a large magnitude of effect in
induction, and for both maintenance doses, including in
patients with previous biologic exposure. Direct and indirect
analysis clearly demonstrated large magnitude effects with high
certainty using multiple outcome rankings. Sensitivity analysis
on naivety status did not reveal a major difference to the main
network.

Implementation considerations: This is a relatively newly
licensed agent with limited long- term safety data. There is a
generic warning for all JAK inhibitors that medications of this
class should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation and unless
there are no other options available, is not recommended in
patients aged 65 and older, those with an elevated risk of major
cardiovascular issues, smokers or former smokers with a long
history of smoking, and those at a heightened risk of cancer.
Additionally, JAK inhibitors should be used carefully in patients
with risk factors for blood clots in the lungs and deep veins
(VTE), not limited to the mentioned groups. In the NMA there
were no differences in adverse outcomes versus placebo, but
long- term safety monitoring is proposed.

GRADE STATEMENT: FILGOTINIB
Summary  of  evidence:  There  was  one  phase  IIb/3  RCT  investi-
gating  the  efficacy  of  filgotinib  for  induction  and  maintenance
treatment in ulcerative colitis170 included in our NMA. There were
no identified concerns about risk of bias for this study. The induc-
tion  study  included  1348  participants,  including  those  biologic
naive (n=659) and biologic exposed (n=689). Participants were
randomised to receive either filgotinib 100 mg (n=562), filgotinib
200 mg (n=507) or placebo (n=279). Concomitant use of immu-
nosuppressants was 12–24% across the study groups. During the
maintenance study, patients with a clinical response at 10 weeks in
either inducion study underwent randomization to receive filgo-
tinib at their induction regimen of 100 mg (n=179) or filgotinib
200 mg (n=202) or placebo (n=190). Responders from the induc-
tion placebo arm continued placebo (n=93) through to week 58.
24–27%  of  participants  were  taking  concurrent  immunomod-
ulator  therapy.  The  GRADE  summary  of  findings  is  in  online
supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 12.

Efficacy induction: In the RCT, clinical remission at week 10
was achieved in 26% of patients receiving filgotinib 200 mg vs
15%  placebo  in  cohort  A  and  11%  of  patients  receiving  filgo-
tinib 200 mg vs 4% placebo in cohort B. There was no difference
between filgotinib 100 mg and placebo.

In the NMA the certainty was low for a trivial benefit for clin-
ical remission; the certainty was low for a moderate benefit for
clinical response; and the certainty was moderate for a moderate
benefit for endoscopic improvement with filgotinib 200 mg over
placebo.

Efficacy maintenance: In the RCT, 37.0% of patients treated
with  filgotinib  200  mg  achieved  clinical  remission  at  week  58
versus  11.0%  for  placebo.  For  filgotinib  100  mg,  23.8%  of
patients  achieved  clinical  remission  versus  13.5%  for  placebo.
In NMA the certainty was high for a large benefit for the main-
tenance  clinical  remission;  the  certainty  was  moderate  for  a
moderate  benefit  for  a  reduction  in  loss  of  response;  and  the

Filgotinib 200 mg is suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Moderate.

Justification: Filgotinib 200 mg has low- certainty evidence
of trivial magnitude for the induction of clinical remission,
low- certainty evidence of moderate magnitude for induction
of clinical response and high- certainty evidence of a large
magnitude for maintenance of remission.

Implementation considerations: Filgotinib 100 mg is not
effective for induction of remission, but has low- certainty
evidence for small effect size for maintenance of remission.
There may be situations when filgotinib 100 mg for maintenance
is appropriate, such as in patients with renal disease. This
medication should be avoided in pregnancy and lactation, and
unless there are no other options available is not recommended
in patients aged 65 and older, those with an elevated risk of
major cardiovascular issues, smokers or former smokers with a
long history of smoking and those at a heightened risk of cancer.
Additionally, JAK inhibitors should be used carefully in patients
with risk factors for blood clots in the lungs and deep veins
(VTE), not limited to the mentioned groups. Long- term safety
monitoring is proposed.

certainty  was  high  for  a  large  benefit  for  endoscopic  improve-
ment with filgotinib 200 mg over placebo.

Certainty and rationale: Overall certainty is low that filgotinib
200 mg is better than placebo, with a moderate magnitude, for
induction of remission in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis,
while the evidence for maintenance of remission is of moderate
certainty with a moderate magnitude. Compared with placebo,
filgotinib 100 mg had low- certainty evidence for a trivial effect
for induction of clinical remission and low- certainty evidence for
a small effect at induction of clinical response. Compared with
placebo, filgotinib 100 mg had low- certainty evidence of a small
effect at the maintenance of clinical remission and low- certainty
evidence  of  a  small  effect  at  reduction  in  loss  of  response.  In
certain high- risk populations, the 100 mg dose could be consid-
ered  appropriate  for  maintenance  (kidney  failure/liver  failure).
There  is  low- certainty  evidence  regarding  adverse  events,  with
no difference seen between filgotinib and placebo.

GRADE STATEMENT: MIRIKIZUMAB
Summary of evidence: One phase III study contributed data to
our NMA.252 A total of 1281 patients underwent randomization
in  the  induction  trial,  544  patients  with  a  response  to  miriki-
zumab  undergoing  randomization  to  the  maintenance  study.
Across  both  studies  there  are  significant  concerns  with  risk  of
bias  due  to  attrition  being  considerably  higher  in  the  placebo
group than in the mirikizumab group. The GRADE summary of
findings is in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 13.
Efficacy  induction:  During  the  induction  trial,  participants
were  randomised  to  receive  either  mirikizumab  (n=958)  or
placebo  (n=321).  The  use  of  concurrent  immunomodulator
therapies  was  23–24%.  At  week  12,  rates  of  clinical  remission
were  24.2%  in  mirikizumab- treated  patients  versus  13.3%  in
placebo. Please see table 7 for estimated time to treatment goals
for mirikizumab.

Efficacy  maintenance:  During  the  maintenance  study,  only
patients who responded to mirikizumab induction therapy were
randomised  to  receive  either  mirikizumab  (n=389)  or  placebo
(n=192).  The  use  of  concurrent  immunomodulator  therapies
was 21.6%. At week 52, 49.9% 0f patients treated with mirik-
izumab  were  in  clinical  remission  versus  25.1%  treated  with
placebo.

Certainty  and  rationale:  Based  on  phase  III  data  included
in the NMA, the overall certainty of the efficacy outcomes for
induction and maintenance was low. The overall magnitude of
effect was small. Although of low certainty, the favourable safety
outcomes make mirikizumab a suitable option for moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis.

Mirikizumab is suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Small.

Justification:The overall certainty is low with a small magnitude
of effect. No unfavourable outcomes have been demonstrated.

Implementation considerations: This is a newly licensed
medication with limited safety data. At the time of writing,
the NICE guidance is for use only if previous exposure to
anti-TNF therapy has failed to induce remission or is clinically
contraindicated. Long-term safety monitoring is proposed.

Guidelines

Risankizumab is suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Moderate.

Justification: The certainty is moderate for a moderate benefit
for induction of remission with risankizumab over placebo. No
maintenance RCT data were available for this guideline and
hence no formal suggestion or recommendation can be issued.
At this time, the GDG would support its use in maintenance in
induction responders.

Implementation considerations: No published maintenance
data were available when the NMA was performed, and long-
term efficacy and safety data are lacking. Long-term safety
monitoring is proposed.

GRADE STATEMENT: RISANKIZUMAB
Summary of evidence: One phase III induction study, INSPIRE,
contributed to the NMA.253 A total of 975 patients underwent
randomization  to  receive  risankizumab  1200  mg  intravenously
at  weeks  0,  4  and  8,  (n=650)  or  placebo  (n=325).  The  study
enrolled  patients  who  demonstrated  intolerance  or  inadequate
response  to  conventional  therapies  and/or  advanced  therapies
(biologics, JAK inhibitors and S1P receptor modulators). The use
of  concurrent  immunomodulator  therapies  was  not  reported.
The  risk  of  bias  was  unclear  as  this  study  was  only  available
in  abstract  format  at  the  time  of  performing  the  NMA.  The
GRADE summary offindings is in online supplemental appendix
4, GRADE table 14.

Efficacy  induction:  In  the  RCT,  clinical  remission  at  week
12  was  achieved  in  20.3%  of  patients  receiving  risankizumab
compared  with  6.2%  of  patients  receiving  placebo.  Clinical
response at week 12 was 64.3% in risankizumab treated patients
versus  35.7%  with  placebo,  and  endoscopic  improvement  for
risankizumab  was  36.5%  versus  12.1%  placebo.  In  the  NMA,
the certainty was low for a moderate benefit for clinical remis-
sion; moderate for a moderate benefit for clinical response; and
moderate for a large benefit for endoscopic improvement with
risankizumab over placebo.

Efficacy  maintenance:  Responders  from  the  INSPIRE  study
have been re- randomised to a risankizumab maintenance study
(COMMAND).253 The results from this study are expected.

Certainty and  rationale: This is a new agent for  which only
the induction data have been published at the time of writing,
and  the  results  from  the  maintenance  study  are  awaited.  The
certainty  is  moderate  for  a  moderate  benefit  for  induction  of
remission  with  risankizumab  over  placebo.  Safety  outcomes
from the induction study are favourable. The GDG supports the
use of risankizumab, conditional to further availability of main-
tenance data.

GRADE STATEMENT: USTEKINUMAB
Summary  of  evidence:  Data  were  included  from  two  RCTs
which evaluated ustekinumab as 8- week induction therapy and
44week- maintenance  therapy.254  A  total  of  961  patients  were
randomised  to  receive  an  intravenous  induction  with  usteki-
numab 130 mg (n=320 patients), 6 mg/kg (n=322), or placebo
(n=319). Patients who had a response to induction therapy were
randomised  to  receive  subcutaneous  maintenance  injections  of
90 mg of ustekinumab every 12 weeks (n=172 patients), or every
8 weeks (n=176) or placebo (n=175). 26–28% of participants

Justification: The overall certainty is low, for a small benefit in
induction and maintenance, with ustekinumab over placebo, and
there are no unfavourable safety outcomes.

Implementation considerations: At the time of writing,
the NICE guidance is for use only if previous exposure to
anti-TNF therapy has failed to induce remission or is clinically

were  taking  concomitant  immunomodulator  therapy.  There
were  no  significant  concerns  in  relation  to  risk  of  bias.  The
GRADE summary of findings is in online supplemental appendix
4, GRADE table 15.

Efficacy induction: Clinical remission at week 8 was achieved
in  15.6%  of  patients  receiving  ustekinumab  130  mg  and  in
15.5% of those receiving induction with 6 mg/kg, versus 5.3%
placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). In NMA the certainty
was  low  for  a  small  benefit  for  clinical  remission;  high  for  a
moderate benefit for clinical response; and low for a moderate
benefit for endoscopic improvement with ustekinumab 6 mg/kg
over placebo.

Efficacy  maintenance:  The  percentage  of  patients  who  had
clinical remission at week 44 was 38.4% in patients assigned to
90 mg of subcutaneous ustekinumab every 12 weeks, 43.8% for
90  mg  subcutaneously  every  8  weeks  and  24.0%  for  placebo.
In NMA the certainty was low for a trivial benefit with usteki-
numab 90 mg every 12 weeks over placebo and a small benefit
for  ustekinumab  90  mg  every  8  weeks  for  clinical  remission.
For clinical response, 90 mg every 12 weeks and every 8 weeks,
both had a small benefit over placebo, with low and moderate
certainty, respectively. For endoscopic improvement, the benefit
of  90  mg  every  12  weeks  over  placebo  was  trivial  and  90  mg
every 8 weeks was small, both with low certainty.

Certainty and rationale: The overall certainty is low for a small
benefit for inducing and maintaining remission of moderate to
severe  ulcerative  colitis  with  ustekinumab  over  placebo.  NMA
and RCT data showed that in responders to induction, mainte-
nance with 90 mg eight- weekly subcutaneous injections achieved
higher rates of clinical remission than 12- weekly dosing. NMA
and  RCT  data  included  studies  of  patients  who  were  either
biologic naïve or biologic exposed (anti- TNF therapy or vedoli-
zumab). There was moderate certainty that ustekinumab had no
unfavourable safety concerns compared with placebo.

GRADE STATEMENT: VEDOLIZUMAB
Summary  of  evidence:  Four  RCTs  were  included  in  the  NMA
with  a  total  of  1368  participants.  In  three  studies,  patients
were  randomised  to  vedolizumab  versus  placebo.255  256  In  the
VARSITY study, patients were randomised to vedolizumab versus
adalimumab.245 A mean of 24% (range 22–52%) were receiving
concurrent immunomodulator therapies. There were no signifi-
cant concerns in relation to risk of bias. The GRADE summary of
findings is in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 16.
Efficacy induction: The induction studies included study arms
for treatment with vedolizumab (n=761), adalimumab (n=386)
or placebo (n=221). In NMA the certainty was low for a trivial

Justification: There is moderate certainty for a small benefit
for inducing and maintaining remission with vedolizumab over
placebo. In safety analysis there was moderate and low certainty
for trivial or no differences compared with placebo.

Implementation considerations: It should be noted that the
treatment effect is small in patients with prior anti- TNF therapy
exposure. Considering the trivial effect of adalimumab in the
treatment of ulcerative colitis, it is suggested that caution is
used in patients with prior infliximab failure. This is based on
NMA sensitivity analyses.

In NMA there is no difference or a trivial difference between
4- weekly and 8- weekly dosing, for the outcomes assessed.
Owing to its gut- specific action, vedolizumab avoids systemic
immunosuppression, making it a suitable treatment option
for patients at higher risk of complications from broad
immunosuppressive treatments. This includes the elderly and
those with comorbidities that might impair their immune
response.

benefit  for  clinical  remission  with  vedolizumab  over  placebo.
The  certainty  was  high  for  a  moderate  benefit  for  clinical
response, and the certainty was low for a small benefit for endo-
scopic improvement with vedolizumab over placebo. Please see
table 7 for estimated time to treatment goals for vedolizumab.

Efficacy  maintenance:  In  the  placebo- controlled  maintenance
studies, 428 responders to induction treatment, were randomised
to  receive  vedolizumab  300  mg  8- weekly  (n=156);  or  4- weekly
(n=155), versus placebo (n=117). The VARSITY study was a treat-
through  design  and  was  excluded  from  the  maintenance  NMA.
In  NMA  the  certainty  was  high  for  a  moderate  benefit  for  clin-
ical remission with vedolizumab 8- weekly, and the certainty was
moderate for a moderate benefit for clinical remission with vedol-
izumab 4- weekly, over placebo. For clinical response, the certainty
was  high  for  a  large  benefit  for  vedolizumab  8- weekly,  and  the
certainty  was  moderate  for  a  moderate  benefit  for  vedolizumab
4- weekly,  over  placebo.  The  certainty  was  moderate  for  a  large
benefit for endoscopic improvement with vedolizumab 8- weekly,
and the certainty was moderate for a large benefit for endoscopic
improvement with vedolizumab 4- weekly, over placebo.

Certainty  and  rationale:  Based  on  four  RCTs,  the  NMA
demonstrates no demonstrable difference between 4- weekly (q4)
and 8- weekly (q8) dosing. There is a trivial effect on induction
of remission (low certainty), but a moderate effect on sustained
remission when used at 300 mg q8 dosing or 300 mg q4 dosing
(high  and  moderate  certainty,  respectively).  Vedolizumab  had
a  moderate  effect  on  clinical  response  (high  certainty)  with
sustained clinical response seen in both 300 mg 8- weekly dosing
(large  effect;  high  certainty)  and  300  mg  4- weekly  dosing
(moderate effect; moderate certainty). There was a small effect
on  endoscopic  improvement  (low  certainty)  during  induction,
but  sustained  endoscopic  improvement  during  maintenance
remission  was  demonstrated  in  both  300  mg  q8  dosing  (large
effect; moderate certainty) and 300 mg q4 dosing (large effect;
high  certainty).  There  were  no  significant  safety  concerns
regarding vedolizumab induction or maintenance highlighted in
the NMA (low to moderate certainty).

Guidelines

Antibiotics are not suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis

FMT is not suggested for induction and maintenance of
remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Trivial.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Trivial.

Justification: The quality of evidence is low, and the magnitude
of effect is trivial.

Implementation considerations: While the overall certainty
is low, the certainty that antibiotics show no difference in
achieving clinical remission compared with placebo is high.
Together with safety concerns about the use of antibiotics, such
as antibiotics resistance, leads the GDG to recommend not using
antibiotics for ulcerative colitis.

OTHER THERAPIES IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS
GRADE statement: Antibiotics
Summary of evidence: In a Cochrane systematic review, 12 RCTs
involving 847 participants were included. One study focused on
maintenance of remission, comparing sole antibiotic therapy with
5- ASAs.  The  remaining  trials  examined  induction  of  remission
by investigating concurrent medications or standard of care regi-
mens with antibiotics as adjunct therapy, or by comparing anti-
biotics with other adjunct therapies.257 The GRADE summary of
findings is in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 17.
Efficacy induction: High- certainty evidence shows no differ-
ence  in  clinical  remission  between  antibiotics  and  placebo
(RR=0.88,  95%  CI  0.74  to  1.06).  There  is  low- certainty
evidence that antibiotics may be no different from placebo (RR=
0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.22) for induction of clinical response.
There is low- certainty evidence that antibiotics show no differ-
ence from placebo for serious adverse events. The data related
to  withdrawal  due  to  adverse  events  are  very  uncertain.  It  is
unclear if there is any difference between antibiotics and 5- ASAs
in failure to achieve clinical remission (RR=2.20, 95% CI 1.17
to 4.14).

Efficacy  maintenance:  It  is  unclear  if  there  is  any  difference
between  antibiotics  and  5- ASAs  for  decreasing  relapses  during
maintenance (RR=0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.06). The certainty of
the evidence is very low.

Certainty  and  rationale:  The  overall  certainly  is  low,  with  a
trivial magnitude of effect compared with placebo, based on the
evidence.  While  no  safety  concerns  have  been  raised,  there  is
insufficient evidence available to be able to make a recommen-
dation for induction or maintenance of remission.

GRADE STATEMENT: FMT
Summary  of  evidence:  A  Cochrane  review  included  10  studies
with 468 participants, of which nine studies focused on adults
and one focused on children. The GRADE summary of findings
is in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 18.

Efficacy  induction:  FMT  may  increase  rates  of  induction  of
clinical  remission  in  ulcerative  colitis  compared  with  control
(RR=1.79, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.84; low- certainty evidence). Five
studies  showed  that  FMT  may  increase  rates  of  induction  of
endoscopic  remission  in  ulcerative  colitis  at  longest  follow- up
(range 8 to 12 weeks); however, the findings were non- significant
(RR=1.45, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.29; low- certainty evidence). Nine
studies  with  417  participants  showed  that  FMT  may  result  in
no difference in rates of any adverse events (RR=0.99, 95% CI
0.85  to  1.16;  low- certainty  evidence).  The  evidence  was  very

Justification: Ongoing research indicates the potential
usefulness of FMT for ulcerative colitis treatment, but current
magnitude of effect is trivial to small, with low certainty.

Implementation considerations: There may be a role for
clinical use of FMT for the induction of remission in ulcerative
colitis in rare circumstances, such as when there are no
remaining licensed medical therapies available. However, such
cases need to be discussed at an individual level, both with the
patient and with consensus from an expert panel, with decisions
on the FMT administration regimen, timing for early assessment
of response/failure and risks compared with other options, such
as a colectomy. There is a need for more high- quality, controlled
studies to establish its efficacy and safety in ulcerative colitis.

uncertain and non- significant for risk of serious adverse events
(RR=1.77, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.55; very low- certainty evidence)
and  improvement  in  quality  of  life  (mean  difference  (MD)
15.34,  95%  CI  −3.84  to  34.52;  very  low- certainty  evidence)
when FMT was used to induce remission in ulcerative colitis.258
Efficacy maintenance: The evidence exploring FMT for main-
tenance of remission in ulcerative colitis is highly uncertain and
comprises  only  one  RCT.  Patients  with  ulcerative  colitis  who
had  achieved  clinical  remission  through  multiple  sessions  of
FMT were randomly assigned to receive maintenance FMT or
placebo colonic delivery every 8 weeks for 48 weeks. Of patients
assigned  to  FMT,  27/31  (87.1%)  achieved  steroid- free  remis-
sion, compared with 20/30 (66.7%) in the placebo group.

Certainty  and  rationale:  The  overall  certainty  for  induction
of  remission  is  low  with  a  small  effect.  There  is  low  certainty
of  evidence  that  demonstrates  no  difference  in  adverse  events
between FMT and placebo. This current evidence base is insuf-
ficient to make recommendations for its use in routine practice.
FMT  may,  however,  be  considered  on  a  case- by- case  basis  for
treatment  of  patients  with  ulcerative  colitis  in  whom  licensed
treatment options have failed or for those who are not suitable
for currently available treatments. There is insufficient evidence
on efficacy or safety to be able to make a recommendation for
use of FMT for maintenance of remission.

GRADE STATEMENT: PROBIOTICS
Summary  of  evidence:  A  Cochrane  review  included  14  induc-
tion studies (865 randomised participants) that met the inclusion
criteria.259  Twelve  of  the  studies  looked  at  adult  participants.
The studies ranged from 2 weeks to 52 weeks in follow- up. The
risk  of  bias  was  high  for  all  except  two  studies  due  to  alloca-
tion concealment, blinding of participants, incomplete reports of
outcome data and selective reporting. This led to GRADE ratings
of the evidence ranging from moderate to very low. A Cochrane
review  included  12  maintenance  studies  (1473  randomised
participants) that met the inclusion criteria.260 Participants were
mostly adults. The risk of bias was high in all except three studies
due to selective reporting, incomplete outcome data and lack of
blinding. This resulted in low‐certainty to very low‐certainty of
evidence. The GRADE summary of findings is in online supple-
mental appendix 4, GRADE table 19.

Probiotics are not suggested for induction or maintenance of
remission in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Small.

Justification: There is low- certainty evidence of small
magnitude effect from probiotics, for induction versus placebo.
There is only very low- certainty evidence for maintenance.
However, the nature of probiotics (type, number of strains,
dosing frequency) remains unclear. The GDG therefore do
not recommend its use for the induction or maintenance
of remission in ulcerative colitis. There is no evidence to
support subgroup analysis and therefore species- specific
recommendations are not possible.

Implementation considerations: The optimum type and
number of bacterial strains along with dosing frequency of the
probiotic remains uncertain.

evidence  to  support  probiotics  in  general  for  the  induction  or
maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.

Table 7 outlines suggested rough estimates of time to achieve
treatment goals after initiation of ulcerative colitis therapies, as
advised by the STRIDE consensus.6 Thus, these times could be
used as a guide when deciding on time intervals to monitor for
remission in ulcerative colitis after initiating a new treatment for
this disease. Data on timelines have been obtained from the rele-
vant licensing trials.

MANAGEMENT OF ULCERATIVE PROCTITIS

GPS 37

We recommend that mild or moderately active ulcerative
proctitis should be treated with 5- ASA suppositories/ foam
enemas (evidence is of moderate certainty for induction and low
certainty for maintenance).




Efficacy  induction:  The  Cochrane  review  found  that  probi-
otics may induce clinical remission when compared with placebo
(RR=1.73, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.54; nine studies, 594 participants;
low‐certainty evidence; downgraded owing to imprecision and
risk of bias, number needed to treat for an additional beneficial
outcome (NNTB) 5). Low‐certainty evidence from a single study
shows that when combined with 5‐ASA, probiotics may slightly
improve  the  induction  of  remission  (based  on  the  Sunderland
disease activity index) compared with 5‐ASA alone (RR=1.22 CI
1.01 to 1.47; one study, 84 participants; low‐certainty evidence;
downgraded due to unclear risk of bias and imprecision).259

Efficacy maintenance: Reported data related to maintenance

and safety are very low certainty.

Certainty  and  rationale:  The  overall  certainty  is  low,  with
an  overall  small  magnitude  of  effect  compared  with  placebo
in  induction  of  clinical  remission,  based  on  the  evidence.  The
effect size varies from small to large between induction studies.
However, there is no evidence to support subgroup analysis and
the  type  and  number  of  bacterial  strains  together  with  dosing
frequency  of  the  probiotic  remains  uncertain,  and  species-
specific recommendations are not possible. There is insufficient

One- third of patients with ulcerative colitis have inflammation
limited to rectum at the time of diagnosis known as ulcerative
proctitis (UP). From a clinical perspective, this is inflammation
in  the  rectum,  usually  up  to  a  maximum  of  15  cm,  and  not
beyond 20 cm from the anal verge. Topical 5- ASAs are effective
for  induction  and  maintenance  of  clinical  remission  and  have
remained the first- line treatment of choice for UP. However, a
significant  proportion  of  patients  do  not  respond  to  5- ASAs.
Active  UP,  for  which  rectal  and  oral  therapy  with  5- ASA  and
corticosteroids  fails,  is  termed  as  refractory  UP.  Refractory  UP
is generally treated in line with the management principles for
left- sided or extensive colitis.

For  the  treatment  of  mild  to  moderate  UP,  first- line  therapy
should  be  either  5- ASA  suppositories  or  enemas.  These  medi-
cations  achieve  higher  mucosal  concentrations,  up  to  200- fold
greater,  when  treating  disease  limited  to  the  rectum  compared
with  oral  agents.261  A  systematic  review  identified  10  studies
assessing the efficacy of topical therapy compared with placebo
and  found  that  topical  therapy  is  significantly  superior  to
placebo for induction of clinical remission (RR=2.72, 95% CI
1.94 to 3.82, GRADE moderate- certainty evidence) without any
statistically  significant  difference  in  the  rate  of  adverse  events
(RR=1.27,  95%  CI  0.24  to  6.57,  GRADE  very  low- certainty
evidence).262 Four studies263–266 have investigated the efficacy of
topical  therapy  for  maintenance  treatment  and  were  included
in a systematic review that demonstrated superiority to placebo
(RR=2.09,  95%  CI  1.26  to  3.46,  GRADE  very  low- certainty
evidence).262 For maintenance treatment there is also no statis-
tically  significant  difference  in  adverse  events  compared  with
placebo (RR=1.38, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.81, GRADE low- certainty
evidence).

Suppositories  have  been  shown  to  be  better  tolerated  than
enemas267  and  there  is  no  statistically  significant  difference  in
efficacy  outcomes268;  we  suggest  individual  patient  preference
and tolerability should be taken into account. Once- daily dosing
is more convenient for patients, and a pooled analysis of three
studies269–271  found  that  there  is  no  difference  between  once-
daily  or  increased  dosing  regimens  of  two  to  three  times  daily
(RR=1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.08, GRADE moderate certainty).262
Administering this once- daily dose at bedtime is convenient and
allows maximal time for the therapy to be retained. There are
limited data with regards to dose- ranging, but one double- blind
study found no statistically significant difference between those

receiving a 1 g dose of topical treatment (suppository) and 1.5
g.272  There  is  minimal  evidence  comparing  different  formula-
tions  of  topical  therapy,262  but  one  study  showed  that  acetyl-
containing 5- ASA preparations may be less effective than 5- ASA
preparations  (RR=3.26,  95%  CI  1.10  to  9.64)  for  induction
of remission.273 The GDG suggest that suppositories should be
considered  first- line  treatment  where  the  maximum  extent  of
microscopic and macroscopic disease activity is within 15 cm of
the anal verge.

MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR ULCERATIVE PROCTITIS
Many patients rapidly respond to initial treatment with topical
5- ASAs  and  remain  in  clinical  remission  without  the  need  for
maintenance therapy. In this setting, many patients prefer to start
treatment  when  they  develop  symptoms.  However,  for  some,
regular preventative treatment is required. Moreover, adherence
to topical therapy can be a challenge, particularly when patients
are in remission as they lose the motivation to administer their
treatment. Given this, it should be noted that alternate or every
third  night  suppository  treatment  does  not  appear  to  substan-
tially reduce the rate of remission.274

GPS 38

We suggest that patients with ulcerative proctitis who do not
respond or are intolerant to 5-ASA suppositories/enema or wish
to avoid systemic 5-ASA may be switched to corticosteroid
suppositories/foam/ enema (evidence is of moderate certainty).
There is no difference in efficacy between suppositories, foam or
enemas.

GPS 39

We suggest that refractory ulcerative proctitis may require
treatment with corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus, JAK- 1, S1P
agonists and/or biological therapy.

Topical  corticosteroids  can  be  used  to  induce  remission
in  UP,  and  both  topical  corticosteroids  (RR=2.83,  95%  CI
1.62  to  4.92,  GRADE  moderate- certainty  evidence)  and
topical budesonide (RR=2.34, 95% CI 14.2 to 3.81, GRADE
moderate certainty) were shown to be superior to placebo in
a  systematic  review  ,which  pooled  data  from  five  studies.262
Overall,  in  this  meta- analysis  there  was  no  difference  in
significant  adverse  events  compared  with  placebo.  These
studies  also  included  suppositories,  foam  and  enema  prepa-
rations and found no difference among them. When different
doses  were  compared,  2  mg  budesonide  suppository  may  be
marginally  inferior  to  4  mg  dose  in  inducing  clinical  remis-
sion (RR=0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96) with no difference in
adverse  events.275  Kruis  et  al  have  also  demonstrated  that
the  4  mg  budesonide  suppository  is  non- inferior  to  2  mg
budesonide  foam  enema  when  inducing  remission,  but  the
4  mg  suppository  group  were  more  likely  to  experience  an
adverse event (RR=1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.45).276 There are
data  suggesting  that  patients  may  prefer  budesonide  foam
compared  with  budesonide  enemas  owing  to  better  tolera-
bility and improved retention.277

Guidelines

When  comparing  topical  corticosteroids  with  topical  5- ASAs,
pooled data from three trials267 275 278 279 show that there was no
statistically  significant  difference  in  clinical  response  (RR=0.99,
95%  CI  0.65  to  1.51,  GRADE  very  low- certainty  evidence).262
Please see table 7 for estimated time to treatment goals for locally
active  steroids.  However,  pooled  analysis  from  these  studies  did
show that histological response is inferior for topical corticosteroids
compared  with  topical  5- ASA  (RR=0.77,  95%  CI  0.62  to  0.95,
GRADE low- certainty evidence). Moreover, Kruis et al found that
endoscopic  remission  rates  were  inferior  compared  with  topical
5- ASAs (RR=0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.93). There was no difference
in adverse events between topical corticosteroids and topical 5- ASA.
For those patients who do not respond to topical 5- ASA mono-
therapy, the addition of a topical corticosteroid has been shown
to be superior in inducing clinical response (RR=1.41, 95% CI
1.05 to 1.9).278 For those being treated with topical corticoste-
roid alone, the addition of topical 5- ASA has also been shown to
be superior to monotherapy for induction of endoscopic remis-
sion (RR=1.28, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.53).275 Combination therapy
of topical and oral 5- ASA has also been shown to be superior to
topical monotherapy in inducing clinical response.280

For  those  patients  not  responding  to  topical  5- ASA  mono-
therapy,  there  is  no  high- quality  evidence  comparing  whether
addition  of  oral  5- ASA  or  topical  corticosteroid  improves
outcomes.  We  advise  this  should  be  a  shared  decision,  with
patient preference and history taken into account.

In severe or refractory UP, it should be ensured that the diag-
nosis  is  correct,  and  that  topical  therapy  has  been  optimised
and  adhered  to.  Concurrent  diagnoses,  such  as  irritable  bowel
syndrome  or  proximal  constipation,  can  contribute  to  symp-
toms.  Differential  diagnoses  that  need  to  be  excluded  include
infection  (lymphogranuloma  venereum,  Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,
herpes simplex virus, syphilis, Giardia duodenalis, amoebiasis),
solitary  rectal  ulcer,  Crohn’s  colitis,  psoriatic  colitis,  chem-
ical  colitis  and  rectal  prolapse.  When  appropriate,  endoscopic
re- evaluation may be required to rule out proximal extension of
the disease.

If  the  diagnosis  has  been  confirmed  initial  treatment  with
a  course  of  oral  corticosteroids  is  recommended,  and  there
are no data to suggest that either budesonide MMX or pred-
nisolone  is  more  effective  than  the  other  for  UP.  If  there  is
an  adequate  response  to  corticosteroids  or  a  need  for  main-
tenance  therapy,  then  biologics,  topical  tacrolimus  or  small
molecule therapy can be considered. Pivotal randomised trials
assessing efficacy and safety of advanced therapies, including
biologics and oral small molecules, in ulcerative colitis gener-
ally exclude patients with proctitis. As a result, the available
evidence  to  inform  the  management  of  refractory  ulcerative
proctitis is limited to very few studies, the majority of which
are observational studies.

A  French  nationwide  retrospective  cohort  study  by  Pineton
de  Chambrun  et  al  investigated  104  patients  with  UP  treated
with  anti- TNF  therapy  (either  infliximab,  adalimumab  or  goli-
mumab).  At  3  months,  50%  of  those  treated  with  anti- TNF
had achieved clinical remission and 60% had achieved mucosal
healing.281 A further retrospective study by Dubois et al looked
at long- term outcomes for UP over a 21- year period.282 In their
study, 31% required treatment for refractory UP and were either
treated  with  azathioprine  monotherapy,  anti- TNF  therapy  or
vedolizumab.  Of  these,  50%  (13/26)  treated  with  anti- TNF
therapy  achieved  clinical  remission  with  median  follow- up  of
21  months,  compared  with  67%  (10/15)  patients  with  vedoli-
zumab  with  median  follow- up  of  11  months;  clinical  response

rates were significantly higher compared with those treated with
azathioprine  monotherapy  (p=0.001).  Seven  patients  treated
with anti- TNF developed adverse events that required treatment
to be stopped, although it should be noted that neither of these
studies used therapeutic drug monitoring.

Topical tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, has been shown to
be effective for refractory UP. A study by Lawrance et al showed
that  topical  tacrolimus,  administered  as  twice- daily  enemas,
was  superior  to  placebo  for  induction  of  clinical  response
(RR=7.27,  95%  CI  1.09  to  48.35)  and  endoscopic  remission
(R= 7.27, 95% CI 1.09 to 48.35).283 A systematic review that
included  five  studies  reported  no  concerning  systemic  adverse
events.284 Serum tacrolimus levels were generally low, but there
was heterogeneity in the dosing regimen in these studies and so
monitoring of trough serum levels is advisable with appropriate
dose adjustment if indicated.

Data  from  ELEVATE  ulcerative  colitis  12  and  ELEVATE
ulcerative colitis 52 have shown that etrasimod, a sphingosine-
1- phosphate  receptor  modulator,  is  superior  to  placebo  for
induction of clinical remission (RR=4.71, 95% CI 1.2 to 18.49)
and maintenance of remission in quiescent UP (RR=2.08, 95%
CI 1.31 to 3.32).248 262 Safety data for the UP cohort were not
specifically reported.

Data for other small molecules is very limited, but a prospective
real- world cohort study from India found that tofacitinib- induced
clinical remission in 47% (15/32) of patients at week 8.285 Adverse
events were comparable to previously published data.

Overall,  there  are  limited  data  from  RCTs  as  historically,
isolated UP has often been an exclusion criterion for trials in ulcer-
ative colitis. There are also no data comparing different advanced
therapies in the treatment of UP to inform which is superior.

There is insufficient evidence at present to recommend topical
acetarsol or appendicectomy as treatment for UP. In refractory
cases,  these  interventions  may  be  considered  in  specialist  units
with experience in these treatments.

ACUTE SEVERE COLITIS
Medical management in ASUC

GPS 40

We suggest that adult patients with acute severe ulcerative
colitis (ASUC) defined by Truelove and Witts’ criteria should be
admitted to hospital for assessment and intensive management.

Approximately 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis will require
hospitalisation for an acute severe flare of disease at some stage
in the natural history of their disease, often as the index presen-
tation.286  Acute  severe  ulcerative  colitis  (ASUC)  is  a  potentially
life- threatening condition and initial risk stratification of patients
with ASUC is based on criteria proposed by Truelove and Witts.287
According to the Truelove and Witts definition, ASUC is charac-
terised by the presence of six or more bloody stools per day and
at least one of the following signs of systemic toxicity: tachycardia
(mean pulse rate >90 beats per minute), fever (>37.8°C), anaemia
(haemoglobin <105 g/L) and/or a raised ESR (>30 mm/h). These
criteria  were  later  modified  to  include  elevated  CRP.  ASUC  is
the most severe form of ulcerative colitis and is a medical emer-
gency, with overall mortality of 1%, and relatively high mortality
in  elderly  patients  compared  with  younger  patients.288  Around
one- fifth  of  patients  hospitalised  with  ASUC  require  subtotal
colectomy during same admission, and risk of colectomy further
increases after subsequent episodes of ASUC.289

GPS 41

We suggest that patients hospitalised with ASUC should have
urgent assessment of blood tests (FBC, CRP, U&E and LFTs,
including albumin), stool culture, Clostridioides screen, non-
invasive imaging and flexible sigmoidoscopy.

GPS 42

We suggest that patients with ASUC should be treated
with high- dose intravenous corticosteroids, such as
methylprednisolone 30 mg every 12 hours or hydrocortisone 100
mg every 6 hours.

INITIAL MANAGEMENT
All  patients  admitted  with  ASUC  should  have  baseline  bloods
(FBC,  CRP,  U&E,  LFTs,  including  albumin,  lipid  profile  and
magnesium, stool culture and Clostridium difficile assay, radio-
logical  imaging  (abdominal  X- ray  scan,  intestinal  US  or  CT
scans)  and  flexible  sigmoidoscopy,  with  close  monitoring  after
admission.  CT  is  the  preferred  modality  when  perforation  or
intra- abdominal collection is suspected. The results of these tests
will also assist in determining the prognosis for that admission
(particularly  to  predict  corticosteroid  failure  and  the  need  for
colectomy).286  290  Early  flexible  sigmoidoscopy  is  important  to
confirm diagnosis, assess severity for prognostication, to obtain
tissue  samples  for  histological  evaluation  for  cytomegalovirus
and to exclude important differential diagnoses, like malignancy.
Stool culture and microscopic examination should be performed
routinely, as soon as practicable, to exclude pathogenic bacteria,
including testing for C. difficile toxin. C. difficile infection has
been  associated  with  a  worse  outcome  in  hospitalised  patients
with IBD.291 292 If C. difficile is detected (or strongly suspected),
treatment with oral vancomycin should be initiated.293 However,
routine  use  of  antibiotics  has  not  proved  to  be  beneficial.294
Patients with ASUC are at increased risk of venous thrombosis,
therefore  appropriate  anticoagulant  prophylaxis  should  be
administered;  this  does  not  precipitate  or  exacerbate  colonic
bleeding.295

INPATIENT TREATMENT

GPS 43



















We suggest that patients with ASUC responding to IV
corticosteroids should be treated with a purine analogue or
receive suitable maintenance advanced medical therapy.

Intravenous corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone 100 mg four
times  daily  or  methylprednisolone  30  mg  every  12  hours,  are
the  cornerstone  in  the  management  of  ASUC.296  Methylpred-
nisolone  has  less  mineralocorticoid  effect  than  hydrocortisone
at these doses and so causes significantly less hypokalaemia.297
Higher  doses  of  corticosteroids  do  not  offer  any  additional
advantage  and  are  associated  with  adverse  events.298  More-
over,  prolonged  intravenous  courses  beyond  7–10  days  carry
no  additional  benefit  and  increase  toxicity.299  In  corticosteroid
responders,  intravenous  corticosteroids  should  be  switched  to
oral corticosteroids when clinically appropriate, usually within
7  days  of  initiation,  and  then  tailed  as  per  local  protocols.

Approximately  two- thirds  of  patients  with  ASUC  respond  to
IV  corticosteroids.  A  systematic  review  of  32  trials  of  steroid
therapy  for  ASUC  involving  1991  patients  reported  an  overall
response to steroids of 67%, with 29% (95% CI 28% to 31%)
having colectomy. Mortality was 1% (n=22/1991; 95% CI 0.7%
to  1.6%),  and  none  of  these  outcomes  changed  between  1974
and 2006 (R2=0.07, p=0.8).296 Patients should be assessed for
a clinical and biochemical, and radiological response after 3–5
days of intravenous corticosteroid steroid therapy to determine
the need for salvage medical or surgical therapy.296 300

The risk of relapse and need for colectomy increases following
an  episode  of  ASUC,  and  increases  further  after  subsequent
episodes.301  In  the  absence  of  advanced  maintenance  therapy,
the  incidence  of  1- year  relapse  is  approximately  50%  despite
purine analogues maintenance therapy.302 In this clinical setting
accelerated  progression  to  a  suitable  advanced  therapy  is
reasonable.

Optimal  maintenance  therapy  in  immunosuppressant  naïve
patients presenting with ASUC who responded to IV corticoste-
roids  following  discharge  is  debatable.  Although  patients  who
responded  to  IV  corticosteroids  appear  to  have  lower  risk  of
hospitalisation and colectomy than patients who needed medical
rescue  therapy,  the  prognosis  remains  unfavourable.303  304  In  a
retrospective study of 142 patients with ASUC who responded
to  IV  corticosteroids,  the  probabilities  of  relapse- free  survival
were 58%, 48% and 40% at 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively, and
the probabilities of colectomy- free survival were 96%, 95% and
91% at 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively.305

There  are  limited  studies  that  have  compared  outcomes
following  maintenance  therapy  with  different  agents  in  this
setting. A retrospective study of 141 patients showed that there
was  no  difference  between  5- ASA  or  azathioprine  or  inflix-
imab.305 However, in this study only limited numbers of patients
were in the infliximab group (n=18). In another retrospective
study, patients who received anti- TNF therapy as maintenance
following  response  to  IV  corticosteroids  were  at  low  risk  of
relapse.305 A recent open- label RCT showed that patients who
responded to steroids and were maintained on azathioprine had
a higher frequency of composite outcome compared with those
maintained on infliximab and azathioprine combination.302 In
that study treatment failure at week 52 was observed in 81.5%
in  the  azathioprine  arm  versus  53.3%  in  the  infliximab  and
azathioprine arm (OR=3.85, 95% CI 1.15 to 12.88, p=0.03).
Treatment failure was defined as absence of steroid- free clinical
remission  (MCS≤2  with  no  individual  subscore  >1),  absence
of  endoscopic  response  (endoscopic  subscore  ≤1),  use  of  a
prohibited treatment, adverse event leading to interruption of
allocated treatment, colectomy or death. Therefore, advanced
therapy  can  be  considered  for  maintenance  therapy  (biologics
or  JAK  inhibitors)  for  patients  who  responded  to  IV  cortico-
steroids  during  an  episode  of  ASUC.  However,  local  avail-
ability of advanced therapies and patient preference should be
considered.

GPS 44

We suggest that patients with ASUC failing to respond to at
least 3 days of IV corticosteroids, as judged by a suitable scoring
system, should be treated with rescue therapy in the form of
intravenous infliximab or ciclosporin. Ciclosporin can be bridged
to purine analogues (if naïve) or a suitable advanced therapy in
accordance with local practice.

Guidelines

Inpatient treatment of corticosteroid-refractory disease
Head- to- head  comparisons  between  ciclosporin  and  infliximab
have demonstrated equivalent efficacy. In the open- label CySIF
trial,  115  patients  previously  naïve  to  infliximab  and  ciclo-
sporin, who had a Lichtiger score >10 points (range 0–21) and
colitis refractory to at least 5 days of intravenous steroids, were
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous ciclosporin (2
mg/kg per day for 1 week followed by oral drug until day 98)
or infliximab (5 mg/kg on days 0, 14 and 42).306 In both groups,
azathioprine  was  started  at  day  7  in  patients  with  a  clinical
response.  The  primary  endpoint  was  treatment  failure  defined
by  absence  of  a  clinical  response  at  day  7,  a  relapse  between
day 7 and day 98, absence of steroid- free remission at day 98,
a severe adverse event leading to treatment interruption, colec-
tomy or death. There was no statistically significant difference
between  treatment  failure  in  patients  given  ciclosporin  (60%)
and  infliximab  (54%).  Nine  (16%)  patients  in  the  ciclosporin
group and 14 (25%) in the infliximab group had severe adverse
events, which was also not statistically different. Similar mucosal
healing rates (47% ciclosporin, 45% infliximab) and colectomy
rates (17% ciclosporin, 21% infliximab) were achieved in both
groups.  There  was  no  difference  in  colectomy- free  survival
at  1  and  5  years  in  patients  treated  with  either  ciclosporin  or
infliximab.307

The  CONSTRUCT  trial  was  an  open- label  pragmatic
randomised trial in 270 patients, who were randomly allocated
(1:1)  to  receive  either  infliximab  (5  mg/kg  intravenous  infu-
sion given over 2 hours at baseline and again at 2 weeks and 6
weeks  after  the  first  infusion)  or  ciclosporin  (2  mg/kg  per  day
by continuous infusion for up to 7 days, followed by twice- daily
tablets delivering 5.5 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks). The primary
outcome was quality- adjusted survival; the area under the curve
of  scores  from  the  Crohn’s  and  Ulcerative  Colitis  Question-
naire was completed by participants at baseline, 3 months and
6 months, then every 6 months from 1 year to 3 years.308 There
was no statistically significant difference between the two groups
for the primary endpoint as well as the secondary endpoints of
colectomy  rates,  time  to  colectomy,  serious  adverse  events  or
death.  Colectomy  rates  were  29%  for  infliximab  and  30%  for
ciclosporin  at  3  months,  and  35%  and  45%,  respectively,  at  1
year,  with  no  significant  difference  between  the  treatments.308
However,  treatment  with  infliximab  was  associated  with  a
greater cost thanwith ciclosporin.

A meta- analysis of infliximab and ciclosporin RCTs shows no
difference  in  response  up  to  1  year.309  For  those  treated  with
infliximab,  either  continuing  repeat  infusions,  combination
therapy with azathioprine, or azathioprine only, the 5- year colec-
tomy  rate  was  similar  at  26.2%.310  Mortality  from  infliximab
trials is comparable to data on ciclosporin (0–2%).286 300 310 The
most significant risk for both infliximab and ciclosporin relates
to those receiving either of these drugs combined with high- dose
corticosteroids, for whom medical treatment fails, and who go
on to colectomy with deteriorating physical condition (anaemia,
hypoalbuminaemia  and  oedema)  where  surgical  complications
are a significant concern.

Generally,  purine  analogues  are  considered  for  maintenance
therapy following induction of remission with intravenous ciclo-
sporin in patients with ASUC. However, in patients for whom
purine analogues have already failed, ciclosporin can be consid-
ered as bridge therapy to advanced therapies such as vedolizumab
or ustekinumab. However, the available evidence supporting this
approach is very limited.

In acute severe ulcerative colitis, delay in surgery is associated
with an increased risk of surgical complications, mandating early
referral and direct involvement of specialist colorectal surgical
and stoma care teams.

GPS 46

We suggest that patients with ASUC who have not responded
within 7 days of rescue therapy with infliximab or ciclosporin,
or those with a deterioration or complications before that time
(including toxic megacolon, severe haemorrhage or perforation)
require subtotal colectomy and ileostomy.

Despite effective medical rescue therapy, a significant propor-
tion of patients still require surgery. Delay in decision to surgery
has been shown to be associated with worse clinical outcomes.
Therefore, timely decision- making is crucial to prevent delays or
prolongation  of  time  to  medical  therapy,  as  those  patients  not
responding to medical therapy and undergoing colectomy have
higher postoperative complication rates after delayed surgery299;
as prolonged admission prior to surgery is a significant predictor
of postoperative complications.311

Multidisciplinary  team  involvement  with  gastroenterologists,
colorectal surgeons and stoma therapists enables better manage-
ment.286  312  Surgical  input  at  an  early  stage  helps  patients  to
understand that colectomy is an important treatment option and
is not an outcome to be avoided at any cost. Prompt joint decision-
making is essential to avoid unnecessary delays. Please see figure 4.

and  extensive  colitis,  independently  correlated  with  lower
infliximab  concentrations  from  weeks  0–6.317  Consequently,
several  observational  studies  were  conducted  to  investigate
benefits  of  an  accelerated  or  intensified  dose  of  infliximab
in  patients  with  steroid- refractory  ASUC.  So  far,  the  results
have  been  conflicting.  In  a  retrospective  study,  three  doses  of
accelerated  infliximab  dosing  at  5  mg/kg,  administered  over  a
median  24  days  to  steroid- refractory  patients,  demonstrated  a
colectomy  rate  of  6.7%  compared  with  40%  (standard  5  mg/
kg  induction  at  0,  2  and  6  weeks).318  However,  longer- term
colectomy rates were similar between standard and accelerated
dosing regimens.318

A  review  suggested  that  dose  intensification  may  benefit
half of patients with ASUC treated with infliximab, with case–
control studies showing that 1–2 extra infusions in the first 3
weeks can dramatically reduce colectomy rates.315 Conversely,
a  systematic  review  that  included  10  observational  studies
assessing a pooled population of 705 patients found no differ-
ence  between  accelerated  and  standard  induction  regimens
associated with either short- term (17% vs 14.5%) or long- term
(25% vs 30.7%) colectomy rates, and no significant difference
in  complication  rates.319  In  a  recent  open- label  randomised
trial  (NCT02770040)  conducted  in  13  Australian  centres,
138  patients  with  steroid- refractory  ASUC  were  randomised
to receive a first dose of 10 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg infliximab in a
1:2 ratio.320 Patients in the 5 mg/kg group were re- randomised
1:1 to standard or accelerated induction groups. Patients in the
10  mg/kg  group  received  a  second  dose  at  day  7  or  earlier  at
time of non- response. There was no difference in day 7 clinical
response between 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg groups (65% (30/46)
vs  61%  (56/92),  p=0.76).  In  the  5  mg/kg  group,  the  rate  of
day  7  response  was  numerically  lower  in  those  with  albumin
<25  g/L  vs  ≥25  g/L  (47%  (15/32)  vs  68%  (41/60),  p=0.07).
However, no difference in clinical response was observed in the
10 mg/kg group when stratified by albumin (64% (9/14) vs 66%
(21/32)  p>0.99).  Patients  receiving  intensified  or  accelerated
induction  achieved  clinical  and  biochemical  remission  earlier
than  with  standard  induction,  but  there  was  no  difference  in
outcomes at 3 months.

For patients who do not respond to initial IV corticosteroids,
we suggest consideration of an intensified dosing regimen
of infliximab in a select group of patients, especially if serum
albumin levels are low.

GPS 48

Several studies have demonstrated an association between higher
serum  levels  of  anti- TNF  and  better  outcomes  in  moderate  to
severe  ulcerative  colitis.313  A  post  hoc  analysis  of  ACT  1  and
2  clinical  trials  noted  that  patients  in  the  lowest  quartile  of
infliximab serum concentration were less likely to achieve clin-
ical  response,  remission  and  mucosal  healing,  independent  of
randomised  dose  (5  mg/kg  or  10  mg/kg).314  In  ASUC,  various
factors,  including  a  high  TNF  burden,  proteolytic  degradation
of anti- TNF associated with increased drug clearance and faecal
losses from increased gut permeability due to severe inflamma-
tion,  support  the  need  for  dose  optimisation  of  infliximab  in
this setting.315 One study showed a relationship between serum
and non- inflamed tissue anti- TNF drug levels, but for inflamed
tissues,  serum  and  tissue  drug  levels  showed  no  association.316
This suggests that high mucosal cytokine levels during inflamma-
tion act as a ‘sink’ for the drug, and thus a higher serum level of
the drug may be required to neutralise tissue TNF.

In another study, a high baseline CRP (>50 mg/L) and a low
serum albumin (<35 g/L), as surrogates for severe inflammation

Oral Janus kinase inhibitors may be considered in selected
patients with ASUC who are corticosteroid- refractory and, after
careful consideration and counselling of benefits and risks.

Oral  JAK  inhibitors,  tofacitinib  and  upadacitinib,  have  been
approved  by  medical  regulatory  authorities  for  the  treatment
of  moderate  to  severe  ulcerative  colitis.  The  OCTAVE  clinical
programme  demonstrated  the  superior  efficacy  and  safety  of
tofacitinib  in  moderate  to  severe  ulcerative  colitis.250  Subse-
quently,  upadacitinib  also  demonstrated  superior  efficacy  and
similar  safety  to  placebo  for  induction  and  maintenance  of
moderate  to  severe  ulcerative  colitis.  There  have  been  several
reports  of  successful  off- label  use  of  these  oral  small  mole-
cules  for  the  management  of  steroid- refractory  ASUC.  A  short
half- life  with  rapid  symptomatic  improvement  by  as  early  as
day  3  in  moderate  to  severe  ulcerative  colitis  and  less  suscep-
tibility  to  intestinal  loss  than  infliximab  make  these  agents
attractive  options  for  the  management  of  ASUC.  However,
there are concerns regarding an increased risk of major adverse
cardiac  events  and  thrombotic  events  in  patients  exposed  to

tofacitinib.183 Consequently, the FDA issued a black box warning
for  all  currently  approved  JAK  inhibitors,  and  guidelines  now
recommend  tofacitinib  as  a  second- line  agent  after  failure  of
anti- TNF therapy in the USA. Therefore, these drugs should be
used with caution in patients with ASUC, which is itself consid-
ered an additional risk factor for thrombosis.

A  retrospective  cohort  study  of  tofacitinib  in  hospitalised
paediatric  patients  with  ulcerative  colitis  for  whom  cortico-
steroids  and  infliximab  had  failed  ,  demonstrated  that  8  out
of  11  (73%)  patients  were  free  of  colectomy  at  90  days  and
6  (54%)  were  free  of  colectomy  at  6  months.321  In  another
retrospective  cohort  study,  hospitalised  patients  with  ASUC
who  received  tofacitinib  (n=40)  were  matched  to  controls
with ASUC according to sex and date of admission (n=113).322
The 90- day colectomy rate was significantly lower in patients
managed  with  tofacitinib  induction  therapy  in  addition  to
intravenous corticosteroids (HR=0.28; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.81;
p=0.018) compared with patients in the control group, when
adjusted  for  disease  severity  covariables.  Subgroup  analyses
showed that this benefit was statistically significant with tofaci-
tinib doses of 10 mg three times daily, but not with twice- daily
dosing.  Although  these  data  are  interesting,  they  are  largely
limited to retrospective case series and should not be used to
inform routine clinical practice.

In  an  interim  analysis  from  a  recent  phase  IV  prospective
interventional  trial,  conducted  across  five  Canadian  hospitals
(NCT04925973),  which  recruited  patients  with  ASUC  refrac-
tory  to  3  days  of  IV  corticosteroids,  24  patients  with  ASUC
received  tofacitinib  10  mg  twice  daily.  Day  7  clinical  response
was achieved in 58.3% (14/24) patients, and at 6 months, 45.8%
(11/24)  patients  remained  on  tofacitinib.323  In  another  recent
pilot RCT, 104 patients with ASUC were randomised to receive
tofacitinib 10 mg three times daily for 7 days while continuing
IV  corticosteroids.  At  day  7,  a  statistically  significant  propor-
tion of patients receiving tofacitinib achieved response (83.0%
(44/53)  vs  58.8%  (30/51),  p=0.007)  compared  with  patients
receiving  placebo.  Notably,  one  patient  receiving  tofacitinib
developed  dural  venous  sinus  thrombosis.  There  are  a  few
reported  case  series  of  patients  with  steroid- refractory  ASUC
whose  disease  was  successfully  managed  by  upadacitinib.324  325
The  use  of  JAK  inhibitors  in  ASUC  is  currently  supported  by
only  limited  evidence  and  should  therefore  be  restricted  to
corticosteroidrefractory  patients  in  whom  conventional  rescue
therapy is contraindicated or has historically failed. Therefore,
efficacy and safety of these agents for ASUC should be assessed
rigorously in well- designed RCTs. There is insufficient evidence
to  make  any  recommendation  on  sequential  ASUC  treatments
required within the same admission.

We recommend that prior to elective surgery for ulcerative
colitis, corticosteroids should be stopped, or the dose minimised
wherever possible to reduce risk of postoperative complications.

GPS 50

We recommend that patients with ulcerative colitis should not
undergo pouch surgery while taking corticosteroids.

GPS 51

We recommend that patients with IBD who have been taking
oral corticosteroids for more than 4 weeks prior to surgery
should receive an equivalent intravenous dose of hydrocortisone
while nil by mouth in the perioperative period.

While the data from the ulcerative colitis population are fewer,
patients  with  ulcerative  colitis  taking  corticosteroids  have  a
higher  risk  of  postoperative  infectious  complications  after
IBD surgery,326 reflecting the studies of mixed IBD or Crohn’s
disease populations.327–330 This is further borne out by studies
from  cohorts  of  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease.  There  is  some
evidence  from  studies  of  a  mixed  group  of  patients  with  IBD
and Crohn’s disease that risks are greater for those taking high-
dose  corticosteroids  (40  mg  prednisolone  or  more).328  330  A
comparison  of  prednisolone  doses  greater  than  20  mg  vs  20
mg or less did not show a significant difference in risk of infec-
tions.327  Use  of  ≥15  mg  oral  corticosteroid  in  patients  with
ulcerative colitis within 30 days of ileal pouch- anal anastomosis
(IPAA)  surgery,  or  ≥20  mg  in  the  setting  of  proctocolectomy,
is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  complications.331  332
Patients  with  IBD  having  elective  surgery  should  have  their
corticosteroids stopped if possible or brought to the lowest dose
that  can  be  managed  without  deterioration.  Patients  who  are
taking  corticosteroids  at  the  time  of  their  IBD  surgery  should
be  given  IV  hydrocortisone  in  equivalent  dose  until  they  can
resume oral prednisolone.329 Prednisolone 5 mg is equivalent to
hydrocortisone 20 mg or methylprednisolone 4 mg. There is no
additional advantage in increasing steroid dosage to cover stress
in the perioperative period, as shown in a randomised trial in
IBD  surgery333  and  case  series.334  Anaesthesiologists  generally
consider a single dose of corticosteroid prior to induction (such
as  dexamethasone  4  mg  intravenously  or  intramuscularly)  for
those  taking  more  than  5  mg  prednisolone.335  Patients  who
are  taking  physiological  corticosteroid  replacement  because
of  disorders  of  the  hypothalamic  pituitary  axis  (such  as  oral
hydrocortisone 20 mg in the morning, 10 mg at night) should
receive supplemental doses in the perioperative period.336 For
patients who have had complete resection of active disease, it
is  important  to  avoid  inappropriate  prolongation  of  steroids
after surgery, and there is virtue in standardised steroid- tapering
protocols  in  the  postoperative  period,  dependent  on  the  dose
and duration of steroids preoperatively.

PREOPERATIVE 5-AMINOSALICYLIC ACIDS (5-ASAS)
A  meta- analysis  of  5- ASA  therapy  leading  up  to  surgery  does
not report an association with an increased risk of postoperative
complications,  although  only  one  study  of  patients  with  ulcer-
ative colitis was included.326

PREOPERATIVE PURINE ANALOGUES
The literature on the use of immunosuppressive therapy (purine
analogues  and  methotrexate)  leading  up  to  surgery  does  not
describe an association with  an increased  risk of  postoperative
complications in patients with ulcerative colitis .326 328

PREOPERATIVE ANTI-TNF THERAPY

colitis,  three  meta- analyses  concluded  that  the  risk  of  postop-
erative  infectious  complications  after  IBD  surgery  was  not

increased  overall  (although  data  are  fewer  than  for  Crohn’s
disease).326  337  338  A  recent  prospective  observational  study  of
a pooled IBD population showed no increased risk of infective
complications in patients with IBD exposed to anti- TNF within
12  weeks  of  surgery  and/or  with  detectable  anti- TNF  trough
levels.339

PREOPERATIVE ANTI-INTEGRIN THERAPY

GPS 53

We recommend that anti- integrin therapy can be continued
in the preoperative period for patients undergoing surgery for
ulcerative colitis.

One study of vedolizumab exposure in a pooled IBD population
showed an increased risk of infectious and non- infectious post-
operative complications compared with those who had received
recent  anti- TNF.340  However,  two  more  recent  meta- analyses,
comparing vedolizumab with anti- TNF or no biologic exposure,
and  vedolizumab  with  no  vedolizumab,  concluded  that  there
were  no  significant  differences  in  infectious  or  non- infectious
postoperative  complications  of  abdominal  surgery  in  patients
with IBD.326 341 Relevant data for other advanced therapies are
lacking.

SURGERY IN ULCERATIVE COLITIS
Surgical management of ASUC

GPS 54

We recommend that subtotal colectomy and ileostomy with
preservation of the rectum should be offered to patients who
have not responded to medical therapy at least by day 7 of
treatment for acute severe ulcerative colitis, and that surgical
resection of the colon and rectum should be offered to patients
who have chronic, active ulcerative colitis despite optimised
medical therapy. Ileoanal pouch reconstruction or end ileostomy
provide equivalent levels of quality of life, and selection should
be guided by patient preferences and choice.

is  essential  to  avoid  unnecessary  delays.8  The  procedure  itself
can  be  performed  either  laparoscopically  or  open  depending
on  local  expertise,  although  a  laparoscopic  approach  is  likely
to result in shorter length of stay and reduced risk of infectious
complications.345–347

In  addition,  surgical  resection  of  the  colon  and  rectum  in
ulcerative  colitis  is  a  treatment  option  for  patients  who  have
chronic,  active  symptoms  despite  optimised  medical  therapy.
is  a  well- established
Proctocolectomy  followed  by  IPAA
management  option  for  ulcerative  colitis.  This  procedure  has
been  associated  with  good  outcomes  for  quality  of  life,  with
a  majority  of  patients  indicating  they  would  undertake  the
same  procedure  again.348–351  IPAA  should  not  be  undertaken
in the acute setting, given the significant risk of complications.
Timing  of  pouch  surgery  should  be  an  individualised  decision
with  multidisciplinary  input,  with  a  minimum  of  3  months
and preferably 6 months from the initial subtotal colectomy in
order  that  adhesions  may  be  safely  managed,  and  the  patient
allowed time to generally recover from the initial procedure.8
Pouch  surgery  discussions  should  ideally  take  place  with  a
surgical team that has experience of performing pouch surgery
in  a  high- volume  centre.  If  local  expertise  is  not  available  in
pouch  surgery,  then  patients  should  be  referred  onwards  for
discussion at a high- volume pouch centre. At the time of ileo-
anal pouch surgery, a temporary loop ileostomy will reduce the
clinical  anastomotic  leak  rate  as  well  as  the  septic  sequelae  of
a  leak.  Creation  of  an  ileoanal  pouch  without  creation  of  an
initial  temporary  loop  ileostomy  is  uncommon  and  should  be
considered  only  in  optimal  circumstances.347  Any  subsequent
anastomotic  leak  from  an  ileal  pouch  anal  anastomosis  would
generally require defunctioning.8 The occurrence of complica-
tions following IPAA surgery in patients with coexistent ulcer-
ative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are higher,
with pouchitis rates as high as 64% reported.352 353 In a more
recent  study  comparing  PSC- pouchitis  (n=182)  with  matched
non- PSC- ulcerative  colitis- pouchitis  (n=182),  patients  with
PSC- pouchitis  were  more  likely  to  develop  chronic  pouchitis
(68.1%  vs  34.1%;  p<0.001),  have  moderate- to- severe  pouch
inflammation (54.9% vs 32.4%; p<0.001) and prepouch ileitis
(34.1% vs 11.5%; p<0.001) compared with ulcerative colitis-
pouchitis.354  However,  patients  can  still  be  offered  pouch
formation  if  they  have  PSC  so  long  as  they  have  had  detailed
counselling and understand the potential implications and risks
of such a procedure.

POUCHITIS

GPS 55

Surgery in ASUC is indicated when the disease is non- responsive
to  medical  therapy,  when  there  are  intolerable  side- effects  of
medication  options,  or  when  there  is  life- threatening  haemor-
rhage, toxic megacolon or perforation.8 For acute severe ulcer-
ative colitis, the preferred operation is a subtotal colectomy and
end  ileostomy  with  long  rectal  stump.342–344  Surgical  input  at
an early stage helps patients to understand that colectomy is an
important treatment option and is not an outcome to be avoided
at any cost. While the guideline suggests that surgery should be
offered at least by day 7, it is recommended that surgical involve-
ment  and  engagement  in  discussions  with  the  patient  about
the  potential  for  surgical  options  will  often  take  place  prior
to  this.  Early  surgical  involvement  and  joint  decision- making

Patients with ongoing symptoms after pouch surgery should
have pelvic MRI scan, stool culture and Clostridioidies difficile
assay. Pouchoscopy should be performed to assess the pouch,
the pre- pouch ileum and the mucosa at the anal transition zone.

Complications following IPAA are relatively common, and can
include  infective,  inflammatory  or  functional  pouch  disorders.
Pouchitis  is  the  most  common  complication.  Acute  pouchitis,
also known as intermittent pouchitis, is defined as pouchitis of
less  than  4  weeks'  duration  which  resolves  fully  with  between
2–4  weeks  antibiotic  therapy.  Chronic  antibiotic- dependent
pouchitis  describes  frequent  episodes  of  pouchitis  that  are
initially  antibiotic  responsive,  but  reccur  days  to  weeks  after

completion  of  antibiotic  therapy.  Chronic  antibiotic  refractory
pouchitis  describes  inadequate  or  incomplete  response  to  anti-
biotic  therapy  with  continuous  or  relapsing- remitting  symp-
toms. Cuffitis describes inflammation of the pouch localised to
the rectal cuff. Additionally patients with IPAA may suffer from
Crohn’s- like disease of the pouch, whereby disease phenotypes
more akin to Crohn’s disease appear; these include fistula arising
greater than 12 months after surgery, stricture of the pouch body
or pre- pouch ileum or pre- pouch ileitis.

Acute  and  chronic  pouchitis  are  the  most  common  compli-
cations  after  IPAA  formation  following  subtotal  colectomy  for
ulcerative colitis. Patients suffer from diarrhoea, rectal bleeding,
pain, faecal urgency and reduced quality of life. In a large retro-
spective study from the USA, 48% of patients experienced pouch-
itis within 2 years of surgery, increasing to 80% within 30 years,
reported in a longitudinal prospective study.355 356 In a separate
single- centre  study,  approximately  17%  of  patients  had  either
chronic  antibiotic- dependent  pouchitis  or  antibiotic- refractory
pouchitis, with symptoms lasting more than 4 weeks, for which
the frequency of relapse can vary significantly between patients.350
Consideration  of  pouchitis  should  prompt  evaluation  of  the
severity  with  biochemical  markers,  such  as  faecal  calprotectin
and  blood  tests,  and  endoscopic  assessment  to  include  exam-
ination of the pre- pouch ileum, pouch body and mucosa at the
anal transition zone (the rectal cuff).357 Other conditions, such
as pelvic sepsis, specific infections such as C. difficile, mechanical
obstruction, pre- pouch or anal stenoses, pelvic floor dysfunction
or non- pouchrelated conditions, should be considered.

Efficacy of treatments for the induction of clinical remission
of pouchitis in adults

GPS 56

We recommend a 2 week course of ciprofloxacin or
metronidazole as the first- line treatment of acute pouchitis. We
suggest that ciprofloxacin is better- tolerated and may be more
effective than metronidazole. We suggest that chronic pouchitis
may be treated with a combination of antibiotics (ciprofloxacin,
metronidazole, tinidazole, rifaximin), oral budesonide or oral
beclometasone.

GPS 57

Acute treatments for pouchitis are normally well- tolerated yet
patients should be counselled about possible side- effects and
advised to seek medical advice should they experience adverse
events. Antibiotics should be prescribed at the lowest dose and
for the shortest duration possible to achieve the intended clinical
benefit.

GPS 58

Chronic refractory pouchitis not responding to antibiotics or
locally- acting corticosteroids should be reassessed to consider
other factors and, if excluded, we suggest that patients may be
offered advanced immunosuppressive therapies. Vedolizumab is
suggested as first- line therapy.

Infrequent  episodes  of  acute  pouchitis  may  be  treated  with  a
short  course  of  antibiotics.  A  small,  randomised  study  testing
the  efficacy  of  ciprofloxacin  1  g/day  against  metronidazol  20
mg/kg/day,  reported  that  both  groups  achieved  remission  after
2  weeks  of  treatment  (7/7  vs  6/9,  RR=1.44,  95%  CI  0.88  to
2.35), although ciprofloxacin produced better reduction in the
Pouch  Disease  Activity  Index,  symptom  scores  and  endoscopic
outcomes.358 A 2–4- week course can be considered where suffi-
cient  benefit  is  not  derived  from  a  2- week  course.  Budesonide
enemas (2 mg/100 ml at night) are an option, with comparable
clinical remission and response rates to metronidazole (500 mg
twice daily) after 6 weeks of treatment.359 High- quality studies
to support the use of probiotics or faecal microbiota transplanta-
tion to treat acute pouchitis are lacking.

In  the  study  comparing  ciprofloxacin  and  metronidazole  to
treat  acute  pouchitis,  ciprofloxacin  was  better  tolerated.  No
patients  receiving  ciprofloxacin  experienced  adverse  events,
while 33% of the metronidazole group had side- effects such as
vomiting, dysgeusia and transient peripheral neuropathy.358

The  advanced  therapy  with  the  most  data  to  support  use  in
chronic pouchitis is vedolizumab; the EARNEST study, a phase
IV  multicentre  double- blind  placebo  controlled  RCT,  demon-
strated  efficacy  of  vedolizumab  in  management  of  chronic
antibiotic- dependent  or  antibiotic- refractory  pouchitis.350  In
total, 102 patients were recruited and prescribed a 4week- course
of  500  mg  twice- daily  ciprofloxacin  at  enrolment,  alongside
vedolizumab  or  placebo  infusions  (both  n=51)  at  the  stan-
dard  induction  and  maintenance  intervals.  Clinical  remission
was higher in the vedolizumab group at week 14 (16/51, 31%
vs  5/51,  10%)  and  at  week  34  (18/51,  35%  vs  9/51,  18%).  In
contrast, a small, randomised trial comparing adalimumab with
placebo for chronic pouchitis showed no benefit.360 The effec-
tiveness  of  other  therapies  in  chronic  pouchitis,  has  only  been
reported in observational cohort studies. Pooled data from these
studies  indicate  clinical  response  rates  of  54%  for  anti- TNF
medications,  72.3%  for  ustekinumab,  52.0%  for  vedolizumab
and 30.9% for tofacitinib, although confidence levels are wide
across the drugs.357

A  study  comparing  metronidazole  with  budesonide  enemas,
reported  withdrawal  owing  to  adverse  events  in  14%  in  the
metronidazole  group,  compared  with  0%  in  the  budesonide
group,  with  symptoms  such  as  metallic  taste,  headache  and
anorexia.359

CROHN’S DISEASE
The  treatment  of  Crohn’s  disease  is  commonly  approached  in
two phases: initially aiming for control of active disease (induc-
tion of remission), followed by ongoing treatment to maintain
remission.  While  traditionally  corticosteroids  have  been  used
for the induction of remission, with exclusive enteral nutrition
(EEN)  and  surgery  also  used  in  some  situations,  the  available
evidence  supports  the  initiation  of  early,  effective  treatment  in
the form of an advanced therapy (biologic and small molecule
drugs), particularly for those patients with moderate and severe
disease activity.361

Early effective treatment has the potential to modify disease
behaviour  and  prevent  complications,  including  a  need  for
surgery.  Besides  proving  a  safer  approach  than  an  ‘accelerated
step- up’  strategy  (steroids,  followed  by  thiopurine  and  then
anti- TNF), it also require less use of healthcare resources.362

The  recent  expansion  in  therapeutic  classes  has  made  treat-
ment  selection  an  increasingly  complex  decision,  particularly
when first- line therapy has failed. Consideration of factors such

s44

as  previous  treatment  experience,  disease  trajectory,  expected
efficacy,  speed  of  onset  and  durability  of  effect,  adverse  effect
profile, and patient factors, including choice of route of delivery,
comorbid  conditions,  local  availability,  resources  and  cost  is
necessary.  The  optimal  preferred  treatment  may  differ  mark-
edly between patients, and typically a multidisciplinary meeting
approach can assist in providing the optimal next steps for the
individual patient’s management.362

While  there  may  be  less  certainty  around  the  management
of  mild  disease,  frequent  monitoring  including  an  array  of
markers  for  gut  inflammation  (faecal  calprotectin,  intestinal
ultrasound, MRE, ileocolonoscopy) is key to identifying those
patients  with  ongoing  inflammation  who  may  benefit  from
therapy optimisation. Regular disease monitoring is also essen-
tial for patients established on advanced therapies as ongoing
disease activity or progression of bowel damage might suggest
that  a  change  in  medical  therapy  or  a  surgical  approach  is
indicated.361

STEROIDS IN CROHN’S DISEASE
GRADE statement: Corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are suggested for induction of
remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s
disease.
Budesonide is suggested for the induction of remission
in patients with mild ileocaecal Crohn’s disease with
treatment for not more than 12.
Corticosteroids are not recommended for maintenance of
remission in patients with Crohn’s disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Small.

Justification: Systemic corticosteroids are effective for induction
of remission, but not maintenance therapy, in Crohn’s disease,
and may be associated with increased risk of adverse events.
We suggest offering systemic corticosteroids for no longer than
8 weeks. Controlled ileal release budesonide is as effective as
systemic corticosteroids for induction of clinical remission, but
not for maintenance in mild to moderate ileal or right- sided
ileocolonic Crohn’s disease

Implementation considerations: Corticosteroids are
easily accessible, but systemic corticosteroids may be associated
with significant side effects, both when patients receive
recurrent induction courses, or when the corticosteroids are
continued long term. The relatively arbitrary duration of up to
8 weeks was set considering that early effective treatment is
important for the long- term management of Crohn’s disease.
The consideration of early clinical and/or biomarker (ie, fCAL)
assessment (ie, 2 weeks after commencement) may be useful
in order to achieve timely escalation to an effective treatment,
if required.361 It is vital to consider best practice related to
side- effects due to corticosteroid use, including good patient
education and use of tools, such as giving patients a ‘steroid
alert card’.

In view of increasing evidence for early advanced therapy
in moderate to severe Crohn’s disease,361 363 we advocate
consideration of whether initiation or change of advanced
therapy is required whenever a course of systemic
corticosteroids is prescribed.

Guidelines

Systemic corticosteroids for induction: In a Cochrane review
published  in  2008,364  two  studies  compared  systemic  cortico-
steroids  with  placebo  and  six  studies  compared  systemic  corti-
costeroids  with  5‐ASA.364  Corticosteroids  were  found  to  be
significantly more effective than placebo at inducing remission in
Crohn’s disease (RR=1.99; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.64; p<0.00001)
with absolute risk reduction of 30% (95% CI 20% to 41%) and
the  number  needed  to  treat  (NNT)  was  3.33  (95%  CI  2.4  to
5.0). Corticosteroid induced adverse events in a higher propor-
tion of patients than placebo (RR=4.89; 95% CI 1.98 to 12.07;
p=0.0006), or low‐dose 5‐ASA (RR=2.38; 95% CI 1.34 to 4.25;
p=0.003). The GRADE summary of findings is in online supple-
mental appendix 4, GRADE tables 20 and 21. Please see table
9 for estimated time to treatment goals for oral corticosteroids.

Systemic corticosteroids for maintenance: A Cochrane review
performed in 2003365 evaluated the effectiveness and safety of
conventional systemic corticosteroid therapy in maintaining clin-
ical remission in Crohn’s disease. Three studies were included in
the  analysis.  The  ORs  for  relapse  on  active  treatment  and  the
corresponding  95%  confidence  intervals  were  0.71  (0.39  to
1.31), 0.82 (0.47 to 1.43) and 0.72 (0.38 to 1.35) at 6, 12 and
24 months , respectively. The use of conventional systemic corti-
costeroids  in  patients  with  clinically  quiescent  Crohn’s  disease
does not appear to reduce the risk of relapse over a 24- month
period of follow‐up. An updated literature search performed in
July 2008 by the same authors did not identify any new trials.

Budesonide  for  induction:  Thirteen  induction  trials  were
included in another meta- analysis.366 Budesonide 9 mg/day was
more  effective  than  placebo  (RR=1.93;  95%  CI  1.37  to  2.73;
GRADE: moderate) but less effective than conventional steroids
(R=0.85; 95% C, 0.75 to 0.97; GRADE: moderate) for inducing
clinical  remission.  At  8  weeks,  47%  (115  of  246)  of  those
receiving a daily dose of budesonide 9 mg/day achieved remission
compared with 22% (29/133) of those receiving placebo. Please
see table 9 for estimated time to treatment goals for budesonide.
Budesonide  was  inferior  to  conventional  steroids  (pooled
RR=0.85;  95%  CI  0.75  to  0.97;  p=0.012;  I2=0%;  eight
studies; 750 participants). Conventional steroids were no longer
superior to budesonide in those with mild to moderate disease as
defined by CDAI<300 (pooled RR=1.00; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.56;
p=0.99; I2=67%; two studies; 175 participants) or those with
ileal or right- sided ileocolonic disease (pooled RR=0.86; 95%
CI 0.75 to 1.00, p=0.05; I2=0%; six studies; 561 participants).
Corticosteroid- related  AEs  occurred  less  often  with  induc-
tion doses of budesonide than steroids (RR=0.64; 95% CI 0.54
to 0.76; GRADE: moderate); budesonide did not increase AEs
relative to placebo (RR=0.97; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.23; GRADE:
moderate).  The  evidence  comparing  budesonide  with  conven-
tional steroids was of moderate quality.

Budesonide  for  maintenance:  Budesonide  6  mg/day  was  not
different from placebo for maintaining remission (RR=1.13; 95%
CI 0.94 to 1.35; GRADE: moderate). Both induction (GRADE:
low  for  3  mg/day,  moderate  for  9  mg/day)  and  maintenance
budesonide treatment (GRADE: very low for 3 mg/day, low for
6 mg/day) increased the risk of an abnormal adrenocorticotropic
hormone test compared with placebo, but less than conventional
steroids (GRADE: very low for both induction and maintenance).
We suggest that the specific phenotype, disease activity, chronicity
and burden are all considered as part of shared decision- making
when deciding whether or not to use corticosteroids.

We  suggest  that  repeated  courses  of  steroids  are  avoided
unless futility of other effective therapies has been established,
and  surgical  options  are  not  available.  Importantly  the  GDG
aims to encourage early assessment (ie, 2 weeks) of clinical and/

or  biochemical  (ie,  fCAL)  response  hoping  to  encourage  early
initiation of effective treatment, which has been shown to asso-
ciated with sustained, corticosteroid- free clinical remission and
avoidance of surgical interventions.361 We propose that the clin-
ical team review the response to an induction course of cortico-
steroids and in cases of limited or poor response, consider the
appropriateness of other treatments.

Conventional  corticosteroids  are  effective  for  induction  of
remission but not maintenance therapy in Crohn’s disease but may
be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  adverse  events.  The  effi-
cacy is of low certainty from trials, and there is no head- to- head
comparison of safety in RCTs between short and long courses of
corticosteroids  (8  vs  12  weeks),  but  eminent  expert  opinion  for
safety has been considered and has led to the statement of 8 weeks.

5-ASAS IN CROHN’S DISEASE
GRADE statement: 5-ASAs
Summary  of  evidence:  A  Cochrane  review  2016367  addressed
induction therapy for mild to moderate active Crohn’s disease,
compared with placebo or active treatment, including steroids.367
Included trials were of highly variable quality, with half rated as
low  quality.  A  separate  Cochrane  review368  addressed  mainte-
nance  therapy.  The  GRADE  summary  of  findings  is  in  online
supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 22.

Efficacy induction: The Cochrane review included 20 studies
(n=2367) of variable quality. A non- significant trend for benefit
of sulphasalazine over placebo was seen, mainly within patients
with Crohn’s colitis (63/141 vs 43/148 remission at weeks 17–18
(RR=1.38 (1 to–1.89). Safety profiles were similar. Compared
with  corticosteroids,  sulphasalazine  was  inferior  (for  remission
RR=0.68).  5- ASA  preparations  are  not  more  effective  than
placebo  in  induction  of  remission  at  various  doses  studied,
including 4–4.5 g/day.

Efficacy maintenance: A Cochrane review of maintenance of
medically induced remission analysed 12 studies (2146 partici-
pants)  compared  5- ASA  with  placebo.  No  difference  was  seen
between 5- ASA (526/998) and placebo (544/1016) in remission
rates at 12 months (RR=0/98, 0.9 to 1.07), for doses 1.6–4 g/
day. Safety profiles were similar.

Certainty  and  rationale:  There  is  overall  low- certainty
evidence  of  no  therapeutic  effect  of  5- ASA  for  induction  or
maintenance  treatment  of  Crohn’s  disease.  Numerous  specific

5-ASA use is not suggested for induction and maintenance
of remission for patients with Crohn’s disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainy. Low. Overall
magnitude: Trivial.

Justification: 5- ASAs are not effective in induction and
maintenance of remission, with efficacy assessed through direct
pairwise meta- analysis.

Implementation recommendations: This recommendation
is unchanged from the 2019 guideline as there are no new
studies to include in analysis. For patients already established on
5- ASAs for Crohn’s disease, we would suggest confirmation of
biochemical remission with a faecal calprotectin. When deciding
whether to continue in patients established on 5- ASA and in
remission, we advocate shared decision- making with the patient.
Because the safety profile is similar to that of placebo, when
patients are keen to continue established therapy, this should be
respected.

Methotrexate is not suggested for use as monotherapy
treatment for induction and maintenance of remission for
patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainy. Very low.
Overall magnitude: Small.

Justification: GRADE evaluation did not show evidence of
a beneficial effect of methotrexate monotherapy in Crohn’s
disease beyond the value determined to be a trivial effect.
Cochrane review results of pairwise analysis for induction are
of moderate certainty for a trivial effect size for efficacy, and
of moderate and low certainty for no difference for safety
outcomes. The maintenance of remission Cochrane review
showed with low certainty a small effect size for efficacy and
low certainty for trivially more total adverse events.

In the NMA, certainty was very low for induction and
maintenance. The RCT data for safety were all of very low
certainty.

Implementation considerations: For patients already in
remission on methotrexate, a discussion should be held to reach
a shared decision before any change in therapy is made

regimens,  doses  and  subgroups  have  been  assessed,  although
variable quality studies. Safety profiles are equivalent. Based on
this the GDG does not support the use of 5- ASAs in the induction
and  maintenance  of  remission  in  Crohn’s  disease.  For  patients
already  receiving  such  therapy,  a  discussion  should  be  held  to
reach a shared decision before any change in therapy is made.

IMMUNOMODULATORS IN CROHN’S DISEASE
GRADE statement: Methotrexate
Summary of evidence: A 2014 Cochrane review of induction of
remission with a total of seven RCTs,369 and a 2014 review of
maintenance of remission, including five RCTs,370 were under-
taken. Data from these RCTs were also included in our technical
review  network  meta- analyses.  The  GRADE  summary  of  find-
ings is in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 23.

Efficacy induction: GRADE analyses indicated that the quality
of evidence was very low to low for most outcomes. The network
meta- analysis  demonstrated  very  low  certainty  data  for  induc-
tion of remission and, as well as for WAEs and TAEs. Please see
table 9 for estimated time to treatment goals for methotrexate.

Efficacy  maintenance:  The  maintenance  Cochrane  review
concluded that methotrexate is probably better than placebo at
the maintenance of clinical remission to 36–40 weeks (RR=1.57,
95% CI 1.1 to 2.23; 98 patients; moderate‐certainty evidence,
moderate effect size). However, this conclusion is based on very
imprecise  data,  while  inconsistency  has  not  been  taken  into
account.  The  network  meta- analysis  demonstrated  very  low
certainty data for maintenance of remission.

Certainty  and  rationale:  The  evidence  for  methotrexate  for
induction,  maintenance  and  safety  outcomes  is  very  uncertain.
No advanced therapy  trials had concomitant  methotrexate  use
of  more  than  50%,  limiting  the  data  to  a  small  set  of  old  and
predominately prebiologic populations.

GRADE STATEMENT: PURINE ANALOGUES
Summary of evidence: In a 2016 Cochrane review of induction
of remission, a total of 13 RCTs with 1211 adult participants for
induction of remission were included.371 They were conducted

Purine analogues (azathioprine and mercaptopurine) are
not suggested for use as monotherapy in induction and
maintenance of remission for patients with moderate to
severe Crohn’s disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Small.

Justification: Purine analogues (azathioprine and
mercaptopurine) have only trivial efficacy in induction of
remission and small effect size for efficacy in maintenance of
remission; they are therefore not routinely suggested for the
management of Crohn’s disease.

Cochrane review results of pairwise analysis for induction are
of moderate certainty for a trivial effect size for efficacy, and
of moderate and low certainty for no difference for safety
outcomes. The maintenance of remission Cochrane review
showed with low certainty a small effect size for efficacy and
low certainty for trivially more total adverse events.

In the NMA, certainty was very low for induction and
maintenance. The RCT data for safety were all of very low
certainty.

Implementation considerations: For patients already in
established remission on these agents, we would suggest a
consultation to encourage shared decisionmaking, and do
not suggest routinely stopping this therapy. Long- term safety
outcomes that are not captured within the RCT study period
should also be considered in clinical practice, when considering
continuation of purine analogues for longer periods.

between 1971 and 2010. In a 2015 Cochrane review of main-
tenance of remission, 11 RCTs with 881 adult participants were
included.372 They were conducted between 1971 and 2013 The
studies  included  in  both  reviews  ranged  in  terms  of  previous
medication use, and allowed concomitant medication during the
trials, but no advanced therapies were permitted. The data from
these RCTs were also included in our technical review network
meta- analyses.  The  GRADE  summary  of  findings  is  in  online
supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 24.

Efficacy induction: Based on the induction Cochrane review
purine analogues are probably not more effective than placebo
for  clinical  remission  (95/197  vs  68/183  achieved  remission;
RR=1.23, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.55; and clinical response (107/225
vs 75/209; RR=1.26, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.62). The evidence was
moderate  certainty.  The  safety  outcomes  of  the  review  were
low  and  moderate  in  GRADE  certainty  for  no  difference  with
placebo.  The  network  meta- analysis  demonstrated  very  low-
certainty data for induction of remission and clinical response,
as well as for all safety outcomes.

Efficacy  maintenance:  In  the  Cochrane  review,  73%  of
participants  treated  with  purine  analogues  maintained  clinical
remission  over  a  6-  to  18- month  period,  compared  with  62%
of  participants  receiving  placebo  (RR=1.19,  95%  CI  1.05  to
1.34;  five  studies,  489  participants;  low‐certainty  evidence,
small effect size). There was low- certainty evidence that purine
analogues  may  lead  to  more  total  adverse  events  than  placebo
(RR=2.45, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.64, trivial effect size). The other
safety outcomes were of very low certainty. The network meta-
analysis demonstrated very low- certainty data for maintenance of
remission, as well as for all safety outcomes. A review of all RCTs
in Crohn’s disease found there is probably a higher occurrence

of pancreatitis of 3.8% in patients exposed to purine analogues
compared  with  those  in  0.2%  in  placebo  groups  (moderate
certainty).373 Most were non-clinically relevant pancreatitis, but
they  did  necessitate  cessation  of  the  purine  analogues.  As  this
was  within  the  stringent  monitoring  of  the  trial  environment,
awareness  in  wider  clinical  use  of  this  risk  is  important.  For  a
wider  consideration  of  the  long- term  safety  profile  of  purine
analogues please review section 5.3.2. Please see table 9 for esti-
mated time to treatment goals for purine analogues.

Certainty and rationale: There is very uncertain evidence of
any  effect  for  purine  analogues  in  the  induction,  and  uncer-
tain evidence for maintenance of remission in Crohn’s disease.
Moreover,  despite  attempts  to  reduce  risk  by  pre- emptive
TPMT±NUDT15  testing,  when  they  occur,  side  effects  may
associate  with  significant  morbidity  (ie,  pancreatitis).  Consid-
eration of this may be taken by starting low- dose azathioprine
in  combination  with  allopurinol,  as  the  side- effect  profile  and
tolerability may be improved with combination treatment.374 375
The PROFILE study demonstrated that top- down therapy with
an infliximab and immunomodulator combination was superior at
1 year than with accelerated step- up therapy, starting with corti-
costeroid  weaning  and  escalating  sequentially  to  immunomodu-
lator monotherapy at first relapse, followed by anti- TNF at second
relapse,  in  the  treatment  of  newly  diagnosed  Crohn’s  disease.
This reinforces the importance of early, effective treatment with
advanced therapies in achieving clinically relevant endpoints.361

WITHDRAWAL OF MONOTHERAPY AZATHIOPRINE IN
CROHN’S DISEASE

GPS 59

Patients with Crohn’s disease considering withdrawal of
immunomodulator monotherapy should be counselled that
even with at least 6 months clinical remission after >2 years
of therapy, withdrawal is associated with an elevated risk of
relapse of one in three patients in the first 1 to 2 years and new
Crohn’s disease related complications.

The effects of withdrawal of immunosuppressant monotherapy
in  people  with  Crohn’s  disease  in  remission  are  uncertain.
Low- quality  evidence  suggests  that  continuing  azathioprine
monotherapy  may  be  superior  to  withdrawal  of  azathioprine
for  avoiding  clinical  relapse  in  people  with  Crohn’s  disease  in
remission.376

A  Cochrane  review376  identified  four  RCTs  where  azathio-
prine monotherapy was stopped in patients with Crohn’s disease
in  clinical  remission.  Thirty‐two  per  cent  (36/111)  of  partici-
pants  withdrawing  from  azathioprine  relapsed,  compared  with
13% (14/104) of participants who continued with azathioprine
therapy (RR=0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72, GRADE low- quality
evidence). The trials included patients in clinical remission, but
there was no assessment of biochemical or endoscopic remission
at the point of inclusion. Even so, these studies are likely to have
selected a subgroup of patients whose Crohn’s disease is respon-
sive  to  azathioprine,  by  virtue  of  the  fact  they  were  in  clinical
remission  while  on  azathioprine  maintenance,  and  at  elevated
risk  of  relapse  after  azathioprine  withdrawal.  This  reflects  the
real- world situation of many patients who are in clinical remis-
sion on long- term azathioprine monotherapy, where the risk of
withdrawing azathioprine should be balanced against the risks of

continuing treatment, such as the increased incidence of lymph-
oproliferative disorders in patients over the age of 50.164

In  clinical  practice,  at  the  time  of  withdrawal  of  an  immu-
nomodulator,  direct  replacement  with  an  advanced  therapy
without waiting for disease flare should also be considered.

ADVANCED THERAPIES IN CROHN’S DISEASE
GRADE statement: Advanced therapies
Certainty  and  rationale:  While  concerns  about  the  safety  of
advanced therapies and cost associated with the use of this class
of  medication  for  the  induction  and  maintenance  of  Crohn’s
disease have previously led to their positioning after corticoste-
roid  and  purine  analogues  or  methotrexate  use,  accumulating
evidence now supports that early, effective treatment is key for
beneficial long- term outcomes for patients with Crohn’s disease.
The advent of biosimilars and availability of oral, subcutaneous
and  infusion  options  allows  for  a  wider  choice  of  agents,  and

Advanced therapies are suggested for induction and
maintenance of remission in moderate to severe Crohn’s
disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. recommendation, Overall
certainty- Low. Overall magnitude – Moderate

Justification: Based on the available body of evidence (direct
and network meta- analysis performed as part of this guideline),
the efficacy and safety of advanced medical therapies (either
biologics or JAK inhibitors), in comparison with no treatment
or treatment with a purine analogue or methotrexate, is clear
and summarised here. Three large, prospective studies have
compared ‘top- down’ versus ‘step- up’ approaches and have
shown superiority in both efficacy and safety with a ‘top
down’ approach, including improvement in clinical activity,
corticosteroid use, endoscopic remission and reduced need for
surgery or hospitalisation.

PROFILE supports that early effective treatment in moderate/
severe Crohn’s disease can lead to sustained, corticosteroid-
free remission, with lower risk for hospitalisations and surgery.
Importantly, it provided further reassurance on the safety of
this approach highlighting, as other phase III and IV studies
have shown before, that the risks associated with active disease
outweigh the risks of effective treatment.361 377 378

A suggestion, as opposed to a recommendation, is made due to
the low certainty and moderate magnitude of evidence.

Implementation considerations: While this guideline does
not aim to provide a ‘one size fits all’ approach or therapy
by algorithm, this overarching principle is presented based
on available data to encourage joint decision- making with
patients at the heart of the MDT. It is likely that the decision
on the appropriate therapeutic strategy will not just include
consideration of the wider individual GRADE recommendations
but depend on mode of action related to individual patient
disease activity, mode of delivery, experience with particular
agents and circumstances (ie, patient preference, family
planning, pregnancy, frailty, presence of comorbidities including
other immune- mediated inflammatory diseases, previous
exposure to other treatments) and on local availability. It is
important to highlight that surgery is a potential option that
should be contemplated whenever an initiation or switching of
medical therapy due to lack of efficacy is considered.

modes  of  action  that  may  facilitate  a  personalised  approach
taking  into  account  each  individual  patient’s  needs  when
managing their Crohn’s disease.

GRADE STATEMENT: ADALIMUMAB (INCLUDES BIOSIMILAR)
Summary of evidence: In a 2019 Cochrane review of induction
of remission, three RCTs with 714 adult participants for induc-
tion of remission were included. They were conducted between
2006  and  2012,  with  a  mix  of  biologically  naïve  and  exposed
patients. In a 2020 Cochrane review of maintenance of remis-
sion,  six  RCTs,  with  1158  adult  participants,  were  included.
They  were  conducted  between  2007  and  2015;  on  a  mix  of
advanced  therapy  naive  and  experienced  patients.  One  study
included  patients  in  remission,  three  studies  included  patients
who had shown response to a biologic, and two studies included
those  who  had  had  ileocolonic  resection.  The  data  from  these
RCTs  were  also  included  in  our  network  meta- analysis,  apart
from  the  studies  on  patients  with  ileocolonic  resection,  which
are considered in a different section. The GRADE summary of
findings is in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 25.
Efficacy induction: Based on the induction Cochrane review,
adalimumab is more effective than placebo at week 4 for clin-
ical  remission  (197/451  vs  173/263  failed  to  achieve  remis-
sion;  RR=0.85,  95%  CI  0.79  to  0.9;  and  response  (257/451
vs  199/263  failure  to  achieve  100- point  response;  RR=0.77,
95%  CI  0.69  to  0.86).  The  evidence  was  high  certainty.  The
safety  outcomes  of  the  review  were  low  and  moderate  in
GRADE certainty for no difference with placebo. The network
meta- analysis demonstrated moderate certainty data for induc-
tion  of  remission  and  clinical  response,  with  a  moderate  and
a large magnitude effect, respectively. Safety outcomes ranged

Adalimumab (including biosimilar) is recommended for
induction and maintenance of remission for patients with
moderate to severe Crohn’s disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Moderate.

Justification: Cochrane review results of pairwise analysis for
induction and maintenance of remission are of high certainty,
with a moderate effect size for efficacy and moderate/low
certainty of no major differences from placebo for safety, for
adalimumab alone (instead of combination). There are similar
data for the use of biosimilar agents. In the NMA, certainty was
moderate for induction of remission and response, with a similar
magnitude effect size of moderate/large. For maintenance,
the clinical picture is similar. The RCT data for safety ranged
in certainty, but there was no indication of differences from
placebo.

Implementation considerations: Adalimumab is widely
available and used frequently in real- world practice, therefore
on balance we suggest offering this option for induction and
maintenance of remission in Crohn’s disease. Risks of serious
adverse events are trivial to small, meaning that in those
who have achieved remission, continuing treatment can be
suggested to maintain remission. Systems are in place to deliver
this medication to patients, and monitoring of the safety and
efficacy is assisted by the availability of drug and antibody titres.
Decision as to whether to use the originator or biosimilar must
be considered within the local clinical commissioning context,
with no evidence to suggest inferiority of biosimilars.

in their GRADE ratings. For all safety outcome with GRADE
certainty between low and high, the differences from placebo
were trivial. Please see table 9 for estimated time to treatment
goals for anti-TNFs.

Efficacy maintenance: In the Cochrane review, 59% (252/430)
of participants treated with adalimumab failed to maintain clin-
ical remission at 52 to 56 weeks, compared with 86% (217/253)
of  participants  receiving  placebo  (RR=0.70,  95%  CI  0.64  to
0.77;  three  studies,  683  participants;  high‐certainty  evidence).
Among  those  who  received  prior  TNF‐α  antagonist  therapy,
69%  (129/186)  of  adalimumab  participants  failed  to  maintain
clinical  or  endoscopic  response  at  52  to  56  weeks,  compared
with  93%  (108/116)  of  participants  who  received  placebo
(RR=0.76, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.85; two studies, 302 participants;
moderate‐certainty evidence).

The network meta- analysis demonstrated moderate- certainty
data  that  adalimumab  may  lead  to  a  large  effect  size  increase
in the maintenance of clinical remission. There were moderate-
certainty  data  that  adalimumab  may  lead  to  a  small  effect  size
increase  in  the  maintenance  of  clinical  response.  The  differ-
ence  in  magnitude  between  response  and  remission  could  be
attributed  to  the  inclusion  criteria  of  clinical  response  at  trial
commencement,  while  the  number  of  people  in  clinical  remis-
sion at trial commencement is unclear.

Certainty  and  rationale:  Adalimumab  is  one  of  the  most
widely used therapies for  induction  and remission  for  Crohn’s
disease. Based on literature review and synthesis the magnitude
of effect is moderate with moderate certainty. The risks of adali-
mumab monotherapy may extend beyond the trial study period.
The  majority  of  systematic  reviews/meta- analyses  of  observa-
tional data combine anti- TNF therapy for analysis, with further
details discussed beneath the GRADE statement for infliximab.
Real- world data supports an association between anti- TNF and
lymphoproliferative disorders.

GRADE STATEMENT: ADALIMUMAB WITH PURINE
ANALOGUES (INCLUDES BIOSIMILARS)
Summary of evidence: There are no direct RCT data that compare
adalimumab combined with purine analogues with placebo, but
there  are  indirect  data  from  an  open- label  RCT  (DIAMOND)
from 2016, which compared adalimumab combined with purine
analogues with monotherapy adalimumab in 176 patients who
were naïve to biologics and purine analogues.380 Another study
compared  adalimumab  combined  with  purine  analogues  with
monotherapy adalimumab in 205 patients381; and one final study
nominally compared adalimumab with placebo; however, more
than 50% of the 325 included patients were receiving concom-
itant  purines.382  Specific  evidence  for  dosing  is  lacking,  as  the
trials do not report this. The GRADE summary of findings is in
online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 26.

Efficacy induction: The induction RCT data were included in
the network meta- analysis we performed for induction of remis-
sion  in  Crohn’s  disease.  Adalimumab  with  purine  analogues
is  probably  better  than  placebo,  with  a  large  effect,  which  can
range from small to large. It may be better than placebo for clin-
ical response, with a large effect, which can range from small to
large. All safety outcomes for adalimumab with purine analogues
were all of very low certainty, and no conclusions can be drawn.
Efficacy  maintenance:  There  is  no  randomised  evidence  on
maintenance. The data are lacking as the RCTs do not stretch to
more than 12 months and did not perform re- randomisation of
participants for a maintenance phase. Maintenance suggestions
are though made based on the induction data.

Guidelines

When Adalimumab is used for induction and maintenance
of remission for Crohn’s disease, it is recommended this is
done in combination with purine analogues.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Moderate.

Justification: The evidence suggests that adalimumab in
combination with purine analogues is probably effective for
induction of remission and response in Crohn’s disease (the
evidence is of moderate certainty). Of particular relevance is
the magnitude of effect, which is 12% larger than adalimumab
alone for remission and 7% larger for response, and the NNT
doubles from 4 to 2.

The maintenance data are lacking for the network owing to lack
of re- randomisation, but data from the DIAMOND379 Trial only
stretch to 12 months. Specific evidence for dosing is lacking,
as the trial data do not report. If the choice is made to use this
option, the GDG notes the recommendation for adalimumab
combination with purine analogues, and this is also considered
here.

Decision as to whether to use the originator or biosimilar must
be considered within the local clinical commissioning context.

Implementation considerations: Individual patient- centred
decision- making should guide the length of dual therapy, and
consideration as to if or when purine analogues are started
and stopped should be based on response and adverse event
experience.

Certainty and rationale: While adalimumab has traditionally
been  seen  predominantly  as  a  medication  that  can  be  used  as
monotherapy,  the  network  meta- analyses  performed  as  part  of
this guideline suggest that in combination with a purine analogue
there  may  be  a  therapeutic  benefit,  which  is  captured  by  the
reduction  in  NNT  from  4  to  2.  There  are  no  data  to  suggest
that  this  may  also  be  true  for  combination  with  methotrexate.
Considering  also  the  risk  of  immunogenicity,  as  demonstrated
in  a  large,  prospective,  observational  study  with  adalimumab
monotherapy, the GDG decided that the combination of adali-
mumab with a purine analogue is recommended.383 The appro-
priateness  and  length  of  combination  therapy  will  need  to  be
tailored to the individual patient’s needs. The longer- term risks
of  adalimumab  combination  therapy  may  extend  beyond  trial
follow- up, with the majority of real- world data including all anti-
TNFs in analysis. This is covered within the infliximab combina-
tion therapy GRADE statement.

GRADE STATEMENT: INFLIXIMAB (INCLUDES BIOSIMILARS)
Summary  of  evidence:  In  a  Cochrane  review  of  induction
of  remission,  a  total  of  10  RCTs  with  1101  participants  for
induction of remission were included.384 They were conducted
between 1999 and 2019, and seven RCTs included biologically
naive participants. The age of the participants ranged from 26
to  65  years.  In  a  Cochrane  review  of  maintenance  of  remis-
sion,  9  RCTs  with  1257  participants  were  included.385  They

Guidelines

Infliximab is suggested for induction and maintenance
of remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s
disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Moderate.

Justification: Cochrane review results of pairwise analysis
for induction of remission are low/moderate certainty for both
efficacy and safety for infliximab alone (instead of combination),
with moderate- effect size. In the network meta- analyses,
certainty was low/moderate for remission and response,
respectively, but with similar magnitude effect size of moderate.
For maintenance, the clinical picture is similar. There are limited
RCT safety data but significant expert experiential use of
the drug. The magnitude is similar to that of the originator,
infliximab, but the overall certainty is low for induction.

Maintenance data are of low to moderate certainty but of large
effect size.

Implementation considerations: The recommendations
regarding combination therapy with infliximab and purine
analogues should be considered. Additionally, evidence from
both pairwise and network analysis suggests similar efficacy for
biosimilar preparations, both as primary therapy and if switched
to these therapies and so this should be considered in the
context of local commissioning; data concerning subcutaneous
preparations were also of very low certainty, but given the
impacts on feasibility and acceptability, this also represents
an option to be considered if such factors are relevant on a
case- by- case basis. Decision as to whether to use the originator
or biosimilar must be considered within the local clinical
commissioning context.

disease  at  baseline.  All  studies  allowed  some  form  of  concom-
itant  medication  during  their  duration.  The  age  of  the  partic-
ipants  ranged  from  18  to  69  years  old.  The  data  from  all  the
RCTs  were  also  included  in  our  network  meta- analysis.  The
GRADE summary of findings is in online supplemental appendix
4, GRADE table 27.

Efficacy  induction:  Infliximab  may  be  more  effective  than
placebo at week 4 for the induction of clinical remission (30/55
vs  3/25;  RR=4.55,  95%  CI  1.53  to  13.50;  number  needed
to  treat  for  an  additional  beneficial  outcome  (NNTB)  3)  and
response (36/55 vs 4/25; R=4.09, 95% CI 1.63 to 10.25, NNTB
3).  The  evidence  was  low  certainty  but  is  from  just  one  small
trial. This is because most trials are either against other compar-
ators or in combination with other treatments (see below). The
network meta- analysis demonstrated very low- certainty data for
induction of remission, but clinical response probably (moderate
certainty) demonstrated a large magnitude effect. There were no
studies of endoscopic induction of remission. All safety outcomes
were  of  very  low- certainty  evidence  of  no  difference  between
infliximab and placebo. Please see table 9 for estimated time to
treatment goals for anti-TNFs.

Efficacy  maintenance:  Infliximab  is  probably  superior  to
placebo in preventing clinical relapse in patients who have mixed
levels of clinical disease activity at baseline and are biologically
naïve (56% vs 75%, RR=0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.84, NNTB=5,
moderate- certainty evidence). We cannot draw any conclusions
on loss of clinical response, withdrawals due to adverse events or
serious adverse events, because the evidence is very low certainty.

Infliximab  may  be  equivalent  to  biosimilar  for  clinical  relapse
(47%  vs  40%  RR=1.18,  95%  CI  0.82  to  1.69),  and  may  be
slightly less effective in averting loss of clinical response (49% vs
32%, RR=1.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.23, low- certainty evidence),
for a population with mixed/low disease activity at baseline. We
cannot  draw  any  conclusions  on  the  effects  of  a  subcutaneous
biosimilar compared with an intravenous biosimilar due to very
low- certainty evidence for all outcomes.

The  network  meta- analysis  demonstrated  low- certainty  data
that infliximab may lead to a moderate effect size increase in the
maintenance  of  clinical  remission.  Although,  it  was  noted  that
as this outcome was defined as loss of response from those who
had only achieved response, not all the patient cohort could be
expected to be included in this outcome and the actual effect was
relatively larger. Endoscopic outcome data were not available.

Certainty and rationale: The overall certainty of the efficacy
outcomes from the pairwise analysis was moderate. The network
data were of lower certainty due to the impact of concomitant
purine analogues that were very common across the cohort of
RCTs  and  as  such  has  left  the  evidence  base  much  smaller  for
infliximab  alone.  Therefore,  the  pairwise  data  weres  consid-
ered in detail by the GDG in the ETDs and led to this overall
moderate judgement, mostly related to issues of risk of bias. The
safety outcomes were all of very low certainty. For further detail
on the safety of long- term infliximab please review section 5.4.1.
The GDG made a conditional recommendation as the sum of
evidence for infliximab alone is relatively limited in certainty and
magnitude  data  are  capricious.  Further  consideration  of  biosim-
ilars  demonstrated  no  difference  in  efficacy  as  either  primary
therapy or when switched from infliximab in a state of remission.
The  GDG  considered  that  biosimilars  share  properties  so  they
should be considered under the single category of infliximab. Data
for  subcutaneous  preparations  were  limited  owing  to  significant
imprecision and risk of bias concerns, but within the single study
with 53 participants the rates of relapse were similar (17/28 SC vs
15/25 IV). The GDG noted that for some patients the advantages
for acceptability and other pragmatic considerations may outweigh
the evidence limitations, and as such, this remains an option.

GRADE STATEMENT: INFLIXIMAB WITH PURINE ANALOGUES
(INCLUDING CT-P13 BIOSIMILAR)
Summary of evidence: A recent Cochrane review considered the
evidence base and in particular, the role of direct purine analogues
study and its proxy study as a significant concomitant therapy.384
There are no direct RCT data that compare infliximab combined
with purine analogues with placebo, but there are indirect data
from the SONIC trial,386 which compared infliximab combined
with  purine  analogues  with  infliximab  alone  and  with  purine
analogues  (three  groups,  508  patients);  the  study  of  D’Haens
2008387  compared  infliximab  combied  nwith  purine  analogues
with  corticosteroids  in  133  patients388;  compared  infliximab
combined with purine analogues with infliximab alone and with
purine analogues alone (three groups, 24 patients)389; compared
infliximab combined with purine analogues with purine analogues
alone  in  115  patients216;  compared  infliximab  combined  with
purine analogues with infliximab alone in 50 patients390; and391
compared infliximab with natalizumab in 79 patients and inflix-
imab with a biosimilar in 220 patients; however, more than 50%
of  their  participants  were  receiving  more  than  50%  concomi-
tant purine analogues. The STOP- IT RCT compared infliximab
with  Purine  analogues  to  Purine  analogues  for  maintenance  of
remission in 115 participants.392 Specific evidence for dosing is
lacking, as the trials do not report this, or report it capriciously.

When infliximab is used for induction and maintenance of
remission for Crohn’s disease, it is recommended this is
done in combination with purine analogues.

Recommendation: Conditional recommendation, overall
certainty moderate, overall magnitude moderate.

Justification: There is widespread availability and real-
world application of the use of infliximab for induction and
maintenance lone and in combination, including a recent
Cochrane review. The evidence does exist for combination of
moderate certainty for both induction and maintenance, but the
larger magnitude in maintenance must be highlighted as this is
close to 20% higher for combination therapy.

The evidence on safety is of very low- certainty, so no conclusions
can be drawn. No data on the potential benefits of increasing
longevity of infliximab through effects on immunogenicity are
available in clinical trials. Expert eminence suggests the use of
combination therapy.

Implementation considerations: Individual decisionmaking
should guide the length of dual therapy and consideration as to
if and when purine analogues are started and stopped (based on
response and adverse event experience).

The  GRADE  summary  of  findings  is  in  online  supplemental
appendix 4, GRADE table 28.

Efficacy  induction:  The  induction  RCT  data  were  included
in  the  network  meta- analysis  we  performed  for  induction  of
remission in Crohn’s disease. Infliximab with purine analogues
is probably better than placebo, with a moderate effec,t which
can  range  from  small  to  large.  They  are  probably  better  than
placebo for clinical response, with a large effect, which can range
from small to large. Endoscopic remission and response were of
very low certainty, and no conclusions can be drawn. All safety
outcomes for infliximab with purine analogues were all of very
low certainty, and no conclusions can be drawn.

Efficacy maintenance: The maintenance data from the network
meta- analysis for clinical relapse and withdrawals due to adverse
effects and serious adverse events are of very low certainty, and
no conclusion can be drawn. For all other outcomes, no main-
tenance  RCT  exists,  or  a  network  meta- analysis  could  not  be
performed.

The  risks  of  infliximab  combination  therapy  may  extend
beyond  trial  follow- up.  Therefore,  real- world  data  have  been
considered when describing safety outcomes, with the majority
of  data  from  pooled  analysis  of  all  anti- TNFs  used  in  combi-
nation with purine analogues for management of IBD. Chupin
et  al’s  meta- analyses  of  four  observational  studies,  comprising
261 689 patients, demonstrate a pooled IRR (per 1000 patient-
years)  of  lymphoma  of  3.71  (95%  CI  2.30  to  6.00;  p≤0.01)
with  combination  therapy,  which  is  significantly  greater  than
either  purine  analogue  or  anti- TNF  monotherapy;  pooled
IRR=1.70 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.81; p=0.039) and 2.49 (95% CI
1.39 to 4.47; p=0.002) respectively.225 A French national data-
base cohort study of 189 289 patients also confirmed increased
risk compared with both anti- TNF and purine analogue mono-
therapy, aHR=2.35 (95% CI 1.31 to 4.22; p<0.001) and 2.53
(95% CI: 1.35 to 4.77; p<0.001), respectively.166 However, an
earlier meta- analysis, while consistent with findings concerning
relative risk, demonstrated the absolute risk of lymphoprolifera-
tive disorders with anti- TNF use to be relatively modest (6.1 per

Guidelines

10 000 patient years vs 1.9 per 10 000 as population expected)
in a group who were largely also exposed to purine analogues237.
Certainty  and  rationale:  The  data  related  to  induction  of
clinical  remission  and  response  are  of  moderate  certainty  and
moderate/large magnitude. Considering also the risk of immuno-
genicity, as demonstrated in a large, prospective, observational
study with infliximab monotherapy, the GDG decided that the
combination  of  infliximab  with  a  purine  analogue  is  recom-
mended.383  The  appropriateness  and  length  of  combination
therapy will need to be tailored to the individual patient’s needs.
Moreover, the superiority of top- down therapy with infliximab
and purine analogues over accelerated step- up therapy should be
once again highlighted.361

THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING
The use of therapeutic drug monitoring for purine analogues
Purine analogues are pro- drugs that exert their action through
metabolism  into  their  active  metabolites,  thioguanine  nucleo-
tides (6- TGN) and the methylated metabolite (methylmercapto-
purine  (MMP)),  implicated  in  adverse  effects.393  6- TGN  exert
their  anti- inflammatory  action  in  IBD  by  incorporating  into
leucocyte  DNA  and  inhibiting  DNA  synthesis  and  by  inducing
apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes.394

PURINE ANALOGUES S-METHYLTRANSFERASE (TPMT)
Purine  analogues  S- methyltransferase
(TPMT)  enzymatic
activity is a major determinant of purine analogues metabolism
and is used as a guide for the initial dosing of purine analogues.
Reduced TPMT enzymatic activity results in lower MMP levels,
higher  6- TGN  metabolites  and  an  increased  risk  of  severe  and
potentially  life- threatening  myelosuppression.  Normal  or  high
activity is most common (89%) in the general population with
intermediate  (11%)  and  low/absent  activity  (0.3%)  relatively
rare.393 395

For  purine  analogues  monotherapy,  a  meta- analysis  demon-
strated that therapeutic levels of 6- TGN between 235 and 450
pmol/8×108  red  blood  cells  (RBCs)  were  associated  with  an
improvement in rates of clinical remission in IBD.396–398 Table 1
describes the interpretation of purine analogues metabolites. In
hypermethylators, purine analogues metabolism is skewed away
from  6- TGN  and  towards  MMP,  which  can  lead  to  subthera-
peutic  6- TGN  (<235  pmol/8×108  erythrocytes)  resulting  in
lower  purine  analogues  efficacy,  and  elevated  MMP  levels
(>5700 pmol/8×108 erythrocytes) increasing the risk of hepa-
totoxicity.393 To detect hypermethylation, defined by a ratio of
MMP  to  6- TGN>11,399  purine  analogues  metabolites  can  be
checked as early as 4 weeks after initiation of purine analogues.
Hypermethylation, and subsequent risk of hepatotoxicity can be
reduced by switching patients to low- dose purine analogues (a
reduction to 25–33% of the dose) in combination with allopu-
rinol at a once daily dose of 100 mg.375 400

Purine  analogue  monitoring  in  combination  with  anti- TNF

therapies

A recent retrospective review of patients ith IBD treated with
purine  analogues  and  infliximab  combination  therapy  found
sevenfold  lower  odds  of  developing  antibodies  to  infliximab,
with  6- TGN  levels  between  235  and  450  pmol/8×108  RBCs,
compared  with  6- TGN  levels  of  <235  pmol/8×108  RBCs.405
Several  studies  suggest  targeting  a  6- TGN  level  of  >125
pmol/8×108  as  this  is  associated  with  lower  odds  of  inflix-
imab anti- drug- antibody formation.233 406–408 This suggests that
targeting lower 6- TGN levels may be sufficient to optimise inflix-
imab therapy in patients with IBD treated with purine analogues
and  infliximab  combination  therapy,  with  possible  benefits
including  decreased  immunosuppressive  burden  and  reduced
purine analogues toxicity. However, the PANTS extension study
found that individuals in the highest baseline purine analogues
dose  quartile  (azathioprine  2.20–4.15  mg/kg,  mercaptopurine
1.06–2.95 mg/kg) were least likely to lose response to combina-
tion therapy, suggesting that full doses of purine analogues may
be more efficacious in combination with anti- TNF therapy.383

GPS 60

For thiopurine monotherapy, we suggest thiopurine metabolites
are used to optimisedrug dosing, aiming for 6-TGN levels
235-450 pmol/8x 10 8 RBCs and MMP levels < 5700 pmol/8x
10 8 RBCs, alongside routine blood monitoring. We suggest
consideration of initiating a concomitant immunomodulator
with or before initiation of an anti-TNF therapy to reduce the
risk of anti-drug antibody development. We suggest monitoring
thiopurine metabolites in combination therapy with anti-
TNFtherapy; however, target levels are less clearly defined.
We suggest aiming for 6- TGN levels of at least 125 pmol/8x
10 8 RBCs but 235-450 pmol/8x 10 8 RBCs may be needed
to prevent immunogenicity to anti-TNF therapy. We suggest
monitoring FBC, U&E and LFT at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, after
initiating thiopurines and then at least 3-monthly to check for
myelotoxicity and hepatoxicity.

THE USE OF THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING IN ANTI-TNF
THERAPIES
Therapeutic  drug  monitoring  (TDM)  can  be  either  proactive,
where  dosing  is  adjusted  based  on  planned  measurements  of
serum  drug  levels;  or  reactive,  where  measurements  of  drug
levels are taken in response to some clinical change.409

A  systematic  review  and  meta- analysis  of  nine  prospective
RCTs  comparing  proactive  TDM  with  conventional  manage-
ment  did  not  demonstrate  a  benefit  with  proactive  TDM  for
maintaining  clinical  remission  in  IBD.410  A  subsequent  system-
atic  review  and  meta- analysis,  examining  both  reactive  and
proactive  TDM,  found  proactive  TDM  to  be  associated  with
a  decreased  risk  of  treatment  failure,  relative  to  standard  care
(RR=0.64, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.86, p<0.01), and a reduced risk
of hospitalisation relative to reactive TDM (R= 0.33, 95% CI
0.21  to  0.54,  p<0.01).411  While  the  earlier  meta- analysis  was
more selective by only including RCTs, with hindsight the study
designs may explain why they did not demonstrate any benefit
from proactive TDM. In the TAXIT trial, patients with IBD were
randomised  to  infliximab  dosing  based  on  either  serum  inflix-
imab levels or clinical judgement alone, and similar proportions
of each arm achieved clinical remission at 1 year.412 However, at
the time of study enrolment, 29% of patients were considered to
have subtherapeutic infliximab levels (<3 μg/mL) and all patients
had  initial  infliximab  dose  optimisation  (levels  of  3–7  μg/mL)
prior  to  randomisation.  Other  studies  only  escalated  the  dose
when infliximab and adalimumab levels were <3 μg/mL and<5
μg/mL,  respectively.412–416  Retrospective  data  now  suggest  that
higher  levels  of  >4.1  μg/mL  and>6.2  μg/mL,  respectively,  are
associated  with  clinical  remission.417  418  The  PANTS  extension
study  measured  serum  drug  levels  at  week  14  after  initiating
anti- TNF and found that the optimal levels to predict remission
at later time points over the 3- year study were 6.1–10.0 mg/L for
infliximab  and  10.1–12.0  mg/L  for  adalimumab.383  The  study
also demonstrated that drug levels were associated with multiple
factors,  including  dose,  weight,  immunogenicity  and  disease
severity.  Currently,  however,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to
recommend targeting such high levels.

While  trough  levels  for  intravenous  (IV)  infliximab  are
necessary,  there  is  little  variation  of  subcutaneous  (SC)  adali-
mumab  throughout  the  cycle,419  and  this  has  also  been  found
for SC infliximab.420 IV and SC infliximab levels are not equiv-
alent  as  was  demonstrated  in  a  study  where  80  patients  were
switched from IV to SC infliximab with a resultant rise in mean
trough  concentration  from  8.2±4.5  µg/mL  to  14.5±5.9  µg/

mL  (p<0.001).421  While  optimal  dosing  levels  have  not  yet
been  established,  a  recent  RCT  from  the  USA  demonstrated
that biweekly dosing  of SC CT- P13  provided  consistent  serum
infliximab concentrations above 13 µg/mL (range 13.2–16.3 µg/
mL) for botu Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, which was
maintained from week 14 to week 54.420 Another recent study
demonstrated that higher concentrations of SC infliximab were
associated with higher rates of favourable therapeutic outcomes,
with  serum  concentrations  >20  µg/mL  significantly  associated
with patients with IBD in deep remission.422

Detecting and interpreting anti- drug- antibody levels is depen-
dent on the type of laboratory assay, the dilution accuracy and
the  positivity  thresholds.423–426  For  example,  drug- sensitive
assays have limited ability to detect anti- drug antibodies in the
presence of circulating drug, due to the formation of anti- drug
antibody–drug  complexes  whereas  drug- tolerant  assays  detect
anti- drug  antibodies  in  the  presence  of  detectable  drug.  Thus,
it is important to interpret immunogenicity data in the context
of  the  laboratory  methods  used.  Furthermore,  anti- drug  anti-
bodies  have  been  shown  to  return  to  normal  in  a  minority  of
patients when repeated 4 weeks later.383 The PANTS extension
study demonstrated that patients with loss of response associated
with anti- drug antibodies had the lowest persistence of anti- TNF
therapies.  The  use  of  TDM  could  therefore  aid  early  deci-
sions  to  switch  therapy  if  anti- drug  antibodies  are  detected.383
Several  small  retrospective  studies  have  consistently  observed
that  anti- drug  antibodies  may  be  suppressed  with  the  addition
of  an  immunomodulator,427  and  a  recent  meta- analysis  found
this strategy resulted in an 87% reduction in anti- drug antibody
levels, a 6.7- fold increase in infliximab trough levels, and recap-
ture of clinical remission in 76%, although the total number of
patients  studied  was  small.428  A  subsequent  study  of  102  indi-
viduals on anti- TNF who developed anti- drug antibodies found
dose escalation of anti- TNF therapy plus dose optimisation of an
immunomodulator was the most effective strategy for suppres-
sion of anti- drug antibodies, which occurred in 65% of patients
within a year, roughly twice that achieved with either strategy in
isolation.429

GPS 61

Whilst there remains uncertainty about the benefit of
therapeutic drug monitoring for anti-TNF therapies, strategies
that lead to dose escalation, whether guided by TDM or not,
tend to result in better clinical outcomes. Anti-TNF therapy dose
escalation alone is less likely to be effective in the presence of
anti-drug-antibodies and therefore testing for these, when loss
of response occurs, may guide treatment decisions, favouring
either dose escalation plus the addition of an immunomodulator
or a switch to another.

THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING IN NON-ANTI-TNF
THERAPIES
Data  for  the  exposure–efficacy  relationships  for  vedolizumab
(VDZ) and ustekinumab (UST) are inconsistent, and evidence for
applying TDM in non- anti- TNF regimens are relatively scarce.

VEDOLIZUMAB
As with anti- TNF therapy, low albumin and high body weight are
predictors of accelerated VDZ clearance.430 Post- hoc analyses of
the GEMINI programme showed that week 6 VDZ serum levels

Guidelines

<17 mg/mL (ulcerative colitis) and <16 mg/mL (Crohn’s disease)
were associated with clinical remission rates comparable to those
of  placebo.431  Higher  trough  concentrations  of  VDZ  in  ulcer-
ative colitis (>38.3 µg/mL) at week 6 were associated with clin-
ical remission at week 14.431 Furthermore, higher median trough
concentrations of VDZ at weeks 2 (>35.6 µg/mL) and 4 (>59.4
µg/mL) were also associated with higher clinical remission rates
at week 14, compared with patients not in clinical remission.431
Dose escalation by increasing dosing frequency from 8- weekly to
4- weekly (GEMINI long- term study) in patients on maintenance
therapy with secondary LOR, who had withdrawn early from the
GEMINI- 2 trial, was reported to have increased rates of clinical
remission  (32%  vs  4%  remission  before  dose  increase).432  The
concomitant use of immunomodulators does not appear to affect
the  clearance  of  VDZ,  the  development  of  anti- vedolizumab
antibodies, or enhance the efficacy of VDZ.433 434 The available
evidence  suggests  that  for  IV  administration,  VDZ  concentra-
tions of 33–37 µg/mL at week 6, 15–20 µg/mL at week 14 and
10–15  µg/mL  during  maintenance  is  associated  with  improved
outcomes. Dose optimisation may improve clinical outcomes, in
those with partial response or LOR. Further studies are needed
to optimise the utility of TDM with VDZ.

USTEKINUMAB
Available  data  on  the  correlation  between  trough  serum  UST
drug  concentrations  and  clinical  outcomes  are  limited  and
mixed,  making  the  role  of  therapeutic  drug  monitoring  less
clear. In the UNITI- 1 and 2 studies in Crohn’s disease, a median
concentration of UST of 2.1 and 6.4 µg/mL respectively, for the
130 mg and 6 mg/kg dose groups and serum concentrations of
the  drug  correlated  with  clinical  remission  at  week  8.435  436  In
the  maintenance  (IM- UNITI)  study,  median  steady- state  serum
trough  UST  concentrations  at  week  26  in  the  group  receiving
the drug every 8 weeks (1.97–2.24 µg/mL) were approximately
threefold higher than in the group receiving the drug every 12
weeks (0.61–0.76 µg/mL), with a trend towards higher rate of
clinical remission in the 8- weekly group. The recently published
STARDUST trial reported that a trough serum UST concentra-
tion of 0.8 to 1.4 µg/mL or greater was associated with clinical
remission at weeks 8 and 16.437 438 Further studies have demon-
strated that escalating the dose from 12- weekly to 8- or 4- weekly
allowed response to be recaptured in >50% of patients.436 439–441
Further  studies  are  needed  to  optimise  the  use  of  TDM  with
UST.

GPS 62

Data for the exposure-efficacy relationships for vedolizumab
(VDZ) and Ustekinumab (UST) are inconsistent, and evidence for
applying TDM in non-anti- TNF regimens are relatively scarce.
Dose escalation may improve clinical outcomes in those with
partial response or LOR however there is insufficient evidence to
support testing for vedolizumab or ustekinumab levels.

GRADE STATEMENT: WITHDRAWAL OF INFLIXIMAB

adult patients with Crohn’s disease on combination therapy of

Guidelines

Routine withdrawal of Infliximab therapy is not suggested
after 1 year of stable remission in Crohn’s disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Moderate.

Justification: There have been two RCTs, and both have
demonstrated an elevated risk of relapse in those discontinuing
infliximab therapy, even with at least 6 months steroid- free
remission and/or in full endoscopic, clinical, and biochemical
remission.

Implementation considerations: Joint decisions regarding
drug withdrawal should be taken in the context of the individual
patient, their disease history, estimated risk of and predicted
consequences of, relapse. Patient preference, disease history,
severity and extent are key factors to guide shared decision-
making.

Before withdrawal of any maintenance IBD therapy is

considered, assessment of disease activity and confirmation of
clinical remission using a combination of clinical, biochemical,
endoscopic/histological, and/or radiological investigations should
be considered to inform the risks and benefits of stopping, while
accepting that even complete remission is associated with a
sizeable risk of relapse.392

Patients with Crohn’s disease should be counselled that even
with at least 6 months corticosteroid- free clinical remission and
with biochemical and endoscopic remission, anti- TNF withdrawal
is associated with an elevated risk of relapse of approximately
one in three patients in the first 1 to 2 years. Re- treatment
with infliximab in the event of relapse is usually successful, but
treatment failure may be higher in patients who smoke (HR=14
(1.5 o to 100)).

We suggest that patients in whom therapy is withdrawn,

should be monitored for evidence of relapse. The optimal
monitoring strategy following withdrawal of maintenance
treatment has not been defined. Monitoring of clinical
symptoms, objective markers of inflammation, such as C- reactive
protein/faecal calprotectin and/or endoscopy and/or non- invasive
imaging for reassessment, seems reasonable.

Relapse was defined by a CDAI of ≥250 at any visit or a CDAI
between 150 and 250 with an increase of at least 70 points, over
two consecutive visits, and a CRP >5 mg/L or a faecal calpro-
tectin  >250  μg/g.  Overall,  207  patients  were  included  in  the
final analysis; 67 in the combination group, 71 in the infliximab
withdrawal group and 69 in the immunosuppressant withdrawal
group. After 2 years, 39 patients had a relapse; 8 (12%) of 67 in
the combination group, 25 (35%) of 71 in the infliximab with-
drawal  group,  6  (9%)  of  69  in  the  immunosuppressant  with-
drawal  group.  At  2  years  the  HR  for  relapse  was  3·45  (95%
CI  1·56  to  7·69),  p=0·003,  for  infliximab  withdrawal  versus
combination, and 4·76 (95% CI 1·92 to 11·11), p=0·0004, for
infliximab  withdrawal  versus  immunosuppressant  withdrawal.
Of note, 22 of 23 patients in the infliximab withdrawal group
who  were  re- treated  with  infliximab  achieved  remission.  The
GRADE summary of findings is in online supplemental appendix
4, GRADE table 29.

Factors associated with time to relapse in multivariable anal-
ysis were: infliximab withdrawal group (HR=6·67 (95% CI 2·17
to 20), p=0·001 versus the combination group; HR=6·25 (95%
CI 2 to 20), p=0·002 versus the immunosuppressant withdrawal
group), young age at diagnosis <17 years (HR=3·34 (95% CI

1·43  to  7·82),  p=0·005),  high- sensitivity  CRP  at  baseline  as  a
continuous variable (1·0 mg/L of high sensitivity CRP inducing
a  0·1  increment  of  HR;  HR=1·10  (95%  CI  1·00  to  1·20),
p=0·039), faecal calprotectin >300 µg/g at baseline (HR=2·62
(95% CI 1·11 to 6·18), p=0·028), CDEIS at baseline as a contin-
uous variable (1·0 point of CDEIS inducing a 0·1 increment of
HR;  HR=1·20  (95%  CI  1·02  to  1·42),  p=0·029).  In  patients
who  discontinued  infliximab;  only  a  6- TGN  at  baseline  >300
pmol per 8 × 108 red blood cells was associated with a reduced
risk of relapse (HR 0·23 (95% CI 0·07 to 0·69) p=0·009).

Treatment  failure  was  associated  with  clinically  significant
stricture at the time of infliximab induction or during infliximab
treatment  (HR=3·68  (95%  CI  1·41  to  9·61),  p=0·008),  and
high  sensitivity  CRP  at  baseline  as  a  continuous  variable  (1·0
mg/L of high sensitivity CRP inducing a 0·1 increment of HR;
HR=1·14 (95% CI 1·0 to –1·21), p<0·0001). In patients who
discontinued infliximab, the only factor associated with failure
in multivariable analysis was active smoking (HR=14·28 (1·47
to 100·00), p=0·022).

The STOP- IT Trial (Discontinuation of Infliximab Therapy in
Patients with Crohn’s Disease)392 was a multicentre randomised
double- blind  placebo- controlled  trial  investigating  withdrawal
of  infliximab  in  patients  in  clinical  (CDAI<150),  biochemical
(normal CRP, WBC, haemoglobin and albumin) and endoscopic
(simple endoscopic score for Crohn’s disease of ≤2) or imaging/
capsule  endoscopy  remission.443  Patients  had  been  on  inflix-
imab  infusions  for  at  least  1  year.  Overall,  115  patients  were
randomised to infliximab continuation or discontinuation for a
total  of  48  weeks.  The  primary  endpoint  was  time  to  relapse
defined as CDAI of 150 or greater, with an increase in at least 70
points over baseline. Overall, no relapses were seen among the
59  patients  continuing  infliximab,  compared  with  23  relapses
in the 56 patients discontinuing infliximab (time to relapse was
significantly  shorter  in  those  stopping  infliximab  (HR=0.08
(95%  CI  0.035  to  0.187),  p<0.001).  By  week  48  relapse- free
survival was 51% in the discontinuation group.

Safety:  Withdrawing  infliximab  from  combination  with
immunomodulator may lead to no difference in adverse events
than continuing infliximab, except the risk of relapse of Crohn’s
disease.

WITHDRAWAL OF AZATHIOPRINE IN ANTI-TNF
COMBINATION CROHN’S DISEASE

GPS 63
















Crohn’s disease patients on a combination of anti-TNF and
immunomodulator therapy should be counselled that withdrawal
of immunomodulator therapy is not associated with a significant
risk of relapse at 2 years if the withdrawal is attempted after >2
years of anti-TNF therapy and if in corticosteroid-free remission
for > 6 months.




Low- quality evidence suggests that stopping the immunomodu-
lator after combination therapy does not seem to have an impact
on relapse risk. In a systematic review of data from three RCTs,
which examined relapse rate after discontinuation of immuno-
modulator,233  444  445  Dohos  et  al  pooled  data  on  186  patients
in  stable  remission  on  combination  therapy  with  either  inflix-
imab or adalimumab.446 Stopping the immunomodulator did not
show  a  significant  elevation  in  risk  of  relapse  compared  with
continuation  of  both  drugs  (RR=1.30,  95%  CI  0.81  to  2.08,

p=0.641). Sensitivity analysis showed that removal of any one
study did not change the direction of the association. Neverthe-
less,  the  quality  of  the  pooled  evidence  was  judged  to  be  low,
and  the  authors  concluded  that  scarcity  of  data  meant  there
was  insufficient  power.  The  authors  further  cited  data  from
two retrospective cohort studies examining this question,447 448
which showed no significant differences between those who did,
or did not remain on the immunomodulator component. Taken
together, these data on outcomes observed over 1–2 years favour
considering withdrawal of the immunomodulator from combi-
nation therapy in those who have achieved longstanding stable
remission of their Crohn’s disease.

It  is  uncertain  whether  removal  of  the  immunomodulator
might result in an increased risk of relapse or adverse events in
the longer term. Given the potential advantages of combination
therapy  on  immunogenicity,  and  the  pharmacokinetics  of  anti-
TNFs, it is conceivable that long- continued immunomodulator
therapy might mitigate the loss of response or specific immune-
mediated  adverse  events.446  However,  there  is  no  current
evidence  of  downstream  benefits  that  would  justify  remaining
on  long- term  combination  therapy  in  someone  with  well-
established, stable remission, and this also needs to be balanced
against the increased risk of malignancies in certain cohorts.449

GRADE STATEMENT: USTEKINUMAB
Summary of evidence: A 2016 Cochrane review on induction of
remission included a total of four RCTs with 2324 adult partic-
ipants.450 They were conducted between 2008 and 2016, with a
mix of biologically naïve and exposed patients. A 2019 Cochrane
review  on  maintenance  of  remission  included  two  RCTs,  with
542 adult patients, who had responded to a previous induction

Ustekinumab is suggested for induction and maintenance
of remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s
disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Moderate.
Overall magnitude: Moderate.

Justification: A Cochrane review of pairwise analysis for
induction of remission concluded with moderate certainty
on a trivial effect size for clinical induction of remission and
small size for response. No major differences from placebo
for safety outcomes with low to high certainty. A Cochrane
review for maintenance concluded with moderate certainty that
ustekinumab probably leads to fewer cases of failure to maintain
clinical remission, with a small effect size, and it probably leads
to less failure of clinical response with a small effect size. In the
NMA, certainty was moderate for induction of remission for a
small effect in favour of ustekinumab compared with placebo,
and a moderate effect for clinical response. For maintenance
of clinical remission the certainty was low that there may be
no difference, while for clinical response there was moderate-
certainty evidence for a small effect size of less loss of response
compared with placebo. The RCT data for safety during induction
were of high and moderate certainty for no or trivial difference,
while for maintenance the safety evidence was of low certainty
for no difference.

Implementation considerations: Real- world experience
suggests that ustekinumab is well tolerated. It can be used after
failure of purine analogues therapy and/or anti- TNF failure

Guidelines

phase.451 The data from these RCTs were also included in our
network meta- analysis. The GRADE summary of findings is in
online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 30.

Efficacy induction: The induction Cochrane review concluded
that ustekinumab was shown to lead to fewer cases of failing to
achieve clinical remission at week 6 (RR=0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to
0.96; high- certainty evidence). The raw numbers of participants
failing to achieve clinical remission at week 6 were 84% (764/914)
and 90% (367/406) in the ustekinumab and the placebo groups,
respectively.  Ustekinumab  was  shown  to  lead  to  less  failure  to
achieve clinical response at week 6 (RR=0.78, 95% CI 0.71 to
0.85; high- certainty evidence). In raw numbers, failure to achieve
clinical response by 70- point decline in CDAI at week 6 was 55%
(502/914) of participants in the ustekinumab and 71% (287/406)
in  the  placebo  groups,  respectively.  Ustekinumab  was  found  to
be no different from placebo for TAEs with high certainty, while
there was moderate certainty there was no difference for SAEs,
and low certainty for no difference in WAEs. Please see table 9 for
estimated time to treatment goals for ustekinumab.

The network meta- analysis demonstrated moderate- certainty
evidence for a small difference favouring ustekinumab to placebo
for induction of remission, and moderate- certainty evidence for
a  moderate  difference  favouring  ustekinumab  to  placebo  for
clinical response. The RCT evidence for the safety outcomes was
high  and  moderate  certainty  for  trivial  or  no  differences  from
placebo.

Efficacy  maintenance:  In  the  Cochrane  review,  the  propor-
tion of participants who failed to maintain clinical remission at
week 22 was 58% (42/72) in the ustekinumab group compared
with 73% (53/73) in the placebo group (RR=0.8, 95% CI 0.63
to  1.02,  moderate  certainty),  and  in  week  44,  49%  (126/257)
compared with 64% (84/131) (RR=0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91,
moderate certainty). The proportion of participants who failed
to maintain clinical response at week 22 was 31% (22/72) in the
ustekinumab group compared with 58% (42/73) in the placebo
group (RR=0.53, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.79, moderate certainty) and
in week 44, 41% (106/257) compared with 56% (73/131) (RR
0.74,  95%  CI  0.6  to  0.91,  moderate  certainty).  Ustekinumab
was found to be no different from placebo for TAEs with high
certainty,  while  there  was  moderate  certainty  there  was  no
difference from SAEs, and low certainty for no difference from
WAEs.  The  network  meta- analysis  showed  that  ustekinumab
may not be better than placebo at maintenance of clinical remis-
sion (low- certainty evidence) and probably leads to less loss of
response  than  with  placebo  (moderate- quality  evidence).  The
safety outcomes were all of low certainty and showed there may
be no differences from placebo.

Certainty  and  rationale:  Overall  certainty  is  moderate,  with
a moderate magnitude, that ustekinumab is better than placebo
for  induction  and  maintenance  of  remission  in  patients  with
moderate  to  severe  Crohn’s  disease.  This  is  based  on  the  data
from  the  network  meta- analyses,  which  suggests  a  small  effect
for  induction  and  moderate  effect  for  maintenance.  The  trials
reviewed included biologic naïve and biologic- exposed patients
which is why ustekinumab can be used after failure of immuno-
modulator therapy and/or anti-TNF.

Evidence of moderate certainty suggests that there are trivially
fewer  withdrawal  adverse  events  with  ustekinumab  compared
with  placebo  during  the  induction  period  and  high  certainty
that  there  are  no  differences  in  SAEs  and  TAEs  in  comparison
with placebo during the induction period. Evidence for adverse
events during the maintenance phase are of lower certainty, but
real- world  experience  suggests  that  ustekinumab  is  generally
well tolerated.

GRADE STATEMENT: RISANKIZUMAB
Summary of evidence: There are four RCTs available (one phase
II  and  three  phase  III)  assessing  efficacy  and  safety  of  risanki-
zumab.  In  the  phase  II  study,  121  patients  were  randomised
1:1:1 ratio to 200 mg, 600 mg of risankizumab and placebo. In
this study, 93% of the included patients were previously treated
with  at  least  one  TNF  antagonist.  Subsequently,  two  phase  III
RCTs  (ADVANCE  (intolerant  or  non- response  to  conventional
therapy  or  biologics)  and  MOTIVATE  (intolerant  or  non-
response to biologics)) assessed efficacy in the induction phase,
and one RCT (FORTIFY (participants who had clinical response
in  ADVANCE  AND  MOTIVATE  studies))  in  maintenance.  In
the  ADVANCE  study,  931  patients  were  assigned  to  risanki-
zumab  600  mg  (n=373),  risankizumab  1200  mg  (n=372)  or
placebo (n=186). In MOTIVATE, 618 patients were assigned to
risankizumab 600 mg (n=206), risankizumab 1200 mg (n=205)
or  placebo  (n=207).  In  FORTIFY  study,  542  patients  were
randomised 1:1:1 to subcutaneous risankizumab 180 mg or 360
mg or placebo every 8 weeks. We included all of these studies in
our network meta- analysis. The GRADE summary of findings is
in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 31.

Risankizumab is suggested for induction and maintenance
of remission in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s
disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Small.

Justification: The evidence for induction is of moderate
certainty on direct comparison and very low certainty on the
network, with a small to moderate magnitude of effect size.
The data for maintenance did not demonstrate higher efficacy
of risankizumab for maintenance of clinical remission. The data
are of moderate certainty on direct comparison, and very low
certainty on network meta- analysis. Although the evidence
is uncertain about the efficacy and safety of rizankizumab
in maintenance of Crohn’s disease, well conducted RCT
data suggest that risankizumab was associated with higher
maintenance of clinical and endoscopic remission rates than
placebo. Higher than expected clinical remission rates in the
placebo group were believed to be secondary to a carry- over
effect from risankizumab that was received during induction
phase. We feel it is still a valuable option for maintenance
following induction. The GDG believed the direct data as well as
inducion data supported the recommendation.

Implementation considerations: Risankizumab has recently
been approved for use in moderate to severe Crohn’s disease
with a history of inadequate response or loss of response to
a previous advanced therapy, intolerance to other advanced
therapies or where an anti- TNF is not considered suitable. While
long- term safety data are still collected, the expectation for
low side- effect profile, in keeping with its mode of action and
its efficacy in both naive and refractory disease, will need to
be considered for its positioning. The recently published data
of a head- to- head, open label RCT comparing risankizumab to
ustekinumab in anti- TNF treated patients (SEQUENCE study),452
showing non- inferiority for clinical remission at week 24 and
superiority in endoscopic remission at week 48 should be taken
into consideration when a decision between the two drugs is
made.

Efficacy  induction:  At  week  12,  25  (30%)  of  82  risanki-
zumab patients (pooled 41 patients in 200 mg and 41 patients
in 600 mg arms) achieved clinical remission vs six (15%) of 39
placebo  patients  (difference  vs  placebo  15·0%,  95%  CI  0·1  to
30·1;  p=0·0489).  In  ADVANCE,  CDAI  clinical  remission  rate
was 45% (adjusted difference 21%, 95% CI 12 to 29; 152/336)
with  risankizumab  600  mg  and  42%  (17%,  8–25;  141/339)
with risankizumab 1200 mg vs 25% (43/175) with placebo. In
MOTIVATE, CDAI clinical remission rate was 42% (22%, 13%
to  31%;  80/191)  with  risankizumab  600  mg  and  40%  (21%,
12% to 29%; 77/191) with risankizumab 1200 mg versus 20%
(37/187)  with  placebo.  The  overall  incidence  of  treatment-
emergent adverse events was similar among the treatment groups
in  both  trials.  In  our  network  meta- analysis,  the  evidence  was
uncertain for induction of clinical remission and the effect was
small.  Whereas  for  the  induction  of  clinical  response,  risanki-
zumab was superior to placebo with moderate effect; however,
the certainty of evidence was low. Please see table 9 for estimated
time to treatment goals for risankizumab.

Efficacy maintenance: In the FORTIFY study, at week 52, clin-
ical  remission  was  reached  in  52%  with  risankizumab  360  mg
compared with 41% with placebo, adjusted difference 15% (95%
CI  5%  to  24%)  (p=0.005).  Similarly,  clinical  remission  with
risankizumab 180 mg was 55% with adjusted difference of 15%
(95% CI 5% to 24%) when compared with placebo (p=0.003).
At week 52, risankizumab was associated with statistically supe-
rior endoscopic remission rates compared with placebo (180 mg
vs 360 mg vs placebo: 30% vs 39% vs 13%; p<0.0001 for both
comparisons).  Adverse  event  rates  were  similar  among  groups.
In  our  network  meta- analysis,  the  evidence  was  uncertain  for
clinical relapse outcome. On analysis of safety outcomes, there
was no difference between risankizumab and placebo. However,
the certainty of evidence was low to very low.

Certainty  and  rationale:  The  evidence  for  induction  is  of
moderate certainty on direct comparison and very low certainty
on network, with a small to moderate magnitude of effect size.
The  data  for  maintenance  did  not  demonstrate  higher  efficacy
of  risankizumab  for  maintenance  of  clinical  remission.  The
data  are  of  moderate  certainty  on  direct  comparison  and  very
low  certainty  on  network  meta- analysis.  Although  evidence  is
uncertain about the efficacy and safety of rizankisumab in main-
tenance  of  Crohn’s  disease,  well- conducted  RCT  data  suggest
that  risankizumab  was  associated  with  higher  maintenance  of
clinical  and  endoscopic  remission  rates  than  placebo.  Higher
than expected clinical remission rates in the placebo group were
believed  to  be  secondary  to  a  carry- over  effect  from  risanki-
zumab that was received during induction phase. The GDG feels
it is still a valuable option for maintenance following induction.
The GDG believed the direct evidence as well as induction data
support  the  recommendation.  The  SEQUENCE  study  showed
non- inferiority of risankizumab versus ustekinumab, in an open-
label  run- through  RCT,  in  clinical  remission  at  week  24  and
superiority in endoscopic remission at week 48.453 All patients
had failed or not tolerated anti- TNF.

Upadacitinib is suggested for induction and maintenance
therapy in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s
disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Small.

Justification: Overall certainty is low. Upadacitinib is suggested
for induction and maintenance of Crohn’s disease.

Implementation considerations: Upadacitinib is currently
recommended where anti- TNF have failed or are not tolerated
or contraindicated. With regard to choice of dosing for
maintenance, there is a lack of good evidence to guide specific
choice or ability to escalate/de- escalate. Upadacitinib is the first
oral agent which has been shown to have efficacy in inducing
and maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease and can facilitate
timely commencement of an early effective therapy. Black box

emerging experience may clarify this risk further. Risk of other
events such as acne/varicella zoster virus (VZV) continue to be
defined and will influence use in Crohn’s disease.

conventional therapy or biologics) and U- EXCEED (intolerant or
non- response  to  one  or  more  biologics))  assessed  efficacy  in  the
induction, phase and one RCT (U- ENDURE (participants who had
clinical response in U- EXCEL and U- EXCEED studies))454 assessed
efficacy during maintenance. In U- EXCEL, 526 patients (2:1) were
assigned  to  either  upadacitinib  45  mg  or  placebo.  Whereas,  in
U- EXCEED, 495 patients (2:1) were assigned to upadacitinib 45
mg, or placebo for 12 weeks. In U- ENDURE study, 502 patient
responders were randomised 1:1:1 to upadacitinib 15 mg or 30
mg or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. We included all of these
studies  in  our  network  meta- analysis.  The  GRADE  summary  of
findings is in online supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 32.

Efficacy induction: In the phase III trials, a significantly higher
percentage  of  patients  who  received  45  mg  upadacitinib  than
those who received placebo had clinical remission (in U- EXCEL,
49.5%  vs  29.1%;  in  U- EXCEED,  38.9%  vs  21.1%)  and  an
endoscopic response (in U- EXCEL, 45.5% vs 13.1%; in U- EX-
CEED, 34.6% vs 3.5%) (p<0.001 for all comparisons). In our
network meta- analysis, upadacitinib was superior to placebo for
induction of clinical remission and clinical response with a small
magnitude of effect with low- certainty evidence. Please see table
9 for estimated time to treatment goals for upadacitinib.

Efficacy maintenance: In the U- ENDURE study, at week 52, a
higher percentage of patients had clinical remission with 15 mg
upadacitinib  (37.3%)  or  30  mg  upadacitinib  (47.6%)  than  with
placebo  (15.1%),  and  a  higher  percentage  had  an  endoscopic
response with 15 mg upadacitinib (27.6%) or 30 mg upadacitinib
(40.1%) than with placebo (7.3%) (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Herpes  zoster  reactivation  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  45
mg and 30 mg upadacitinib groups than in the respective placebo
groups, and hepatic disorders and neutropenia were more frequent
in the 30 mg upadacitinib group than in the other maintenance
groups.  Gastrointestinal  perforations  developed  in  four  patients
who  received  45  mg  upadacitinib  and  in  one  patient  each  who
received 30 mg or 15 mg upadacitinib. There was low- certainty
evidence to suggest that there was no difference between upadac-
itinib and placebo for clinical relapse outcome in the maintenance
phase  but,  there  was  high- certainty  evidence  for  loss  of  clinical
response with moderate- effect size. On analysis of safety outcomes,
there was no difference between upadacitinib and placebo.

Guidelines

Certainty  and  rationale:  Overall  certainty  is  low,  suggesting
that upadacitinib may be better than placebo for induction and
maintenance  of  clinical  remission.  It  is  important  to  highlight,
that  this  is  the  first  oral  agent  shown  to  be  effective  and  safe
in both inducing and maintaining remission in Crohn’s disease.
Initiation  and  maintenance  will  depend  on  the  individual
patient’s needs, taking into consideration their background risk
for major cardiovascular events, VTE and family planning.

GRADE STATEMENT: VEDOLIZUMAB
Summary of evidence: In a 2023 Cochrane review of induction
and maintenance of remission, a total of four RCTs with 1025
adult participants for induction and three RCTs with 895 partic-
ipants for maintenance were included.452 They were conducted
between  2008  and  2021,  with  a  mix  of  biologically  naïve  and
exposed  patients.  The  induction  studies  included  participants
with  active  disease,  while  the  maintenance  studies  included
participants  with  both  active  and  inactive  disease,  who  had
shown clinical response in the preceding induction trial phases.
All studies allowed some form of concomitant medication. The
data from these RCTs were also included in our network meta-
analysis. The GRADE summary of findings is in online supple-
mental appendix 4, GRADE table 33.

Efficacy induction: Based on the induction Cochrane review,
vedolizumab is more effective than placebo at week 6 to 10 for
clinical remission, with a trivial effect (71 more per 1000 with
clinical remission; RR=1.61, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.17, NNT for addi-
tional benefit 13, high certainty; and clinical response at weeks
52–60  (105  more  per  1000  with  clinical  response;  RR=1.43,
95%  CI  1.19  to  1.71).  The  evidence  was  high  certainty.  The
safety  outcomes  of  the  review  were  low  and  moderate  in
GRADE certainty for no difference with placebo. The network

Vedolizumab is not suggested for induction and
maintenance of remission in patients with moderate to
severe Crohn’s disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Trivial.

Justification:A Cochrane review of pairwise analysis for
induction and maintenance of remission concluded with high-
certainty evidence of a trivial effect size for induction and small
effect size for maintenance of remission. No major differences
from placebo were observed for safety outcomes (moderate
certainty). In the network meta- analyses, certainty was low for
induction of remission and response, with trivial magnitude
of effect size. For maintenance, the clinical picture is similar.
The RCT data for safety ranged in certainty, but there was no
indication of differences from placebo.

Implementation considerations: The trivial effect size is seen
on all direct evidence, whether biologic naïve or not. However, a
better effect was seen in naïve patients. This therapy may have a
role in targeted patients when other options are not appropriate
or when induction is achieved through other modalities, but
the low effect size must be discussed with patients as part of
shared decision- making. The recommendation is based on the
magnitude thresholds used to guide decision- making for the
BSG guideline and does not preclude the use of the drug for the
management of Crohn’s disease where this has been agreed
with the patient and the wider IBD MDT.

small effect size (141 more per 1000 with maintenance of clin-
ical remission, RR=1.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.87, NNTB 7, high
certainty).  The  safety  outcomes  of  the  review  were  low  and
moderate in GRADE certainty for no difference with placebo.
In  the  network  meta- analysis,  vedolizumab  may  not  be  supe-
rior  to  placebo  for  maintenance  of  clinical  remission  with
moderate- certainty evidence. There was low- certainty evidence
that  vedolizumab  may  lead  to  a  trivial  effect  on  maintenance
of  clinical  response.  There  was  moderate  certainty  for  WAEs
and  low  certainty  for  SAEs  and  TAEs  for  no  difference  from
placebo.

Certainty and rationale: Overall certainty is low with a trivial
magnitude  that  vedolizumab  is  better  than  placebo  for  induc-
tion,  and  small  magnitude  for  maintenance  of  remission  in
patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. This is based
on the data from the network and Cochrane review. The trivial
effect size was irrespective of whether biologic naive or exposed.
The trivial effect size must be discussed with patients as part of
shared decision- making.

Evidence of moderate certainty suggests that there are fewer
withdrawal  adverse  events  with  vedolizumab,  compared  with
placebo during the induction period and high certainty that there
are no difference in SAEs and TAEs in comparison with placebo
during the induction period. Evidence for adverse events during
the maintenance phase is of lower certainty, but real- world expe-
rience suggests that vedolizumab is generally well tolerated with
a low incidence of adverse events.

There  are  clinical  scenarios  where  individual  patient  factors
may still indicate a role for this therapy, but it is vital to clearly
discuss  and  communicate  the  magnitude  of  effect  data  with
patients. This should clarify that the existing data do not indicate
a smaller effect in individuals, rather that fewer individuals will
experience a successful outcome overall. If patients do experience
such  a  remission,  this  will  be  no  different  from  the  result  with
other therapies. The practising clinician should take into consid-
eration the findings from the LOVE- CD prospective study. This
study was not used in our evidence synthesis owing to its lack of
randomisation. Nevertheless, anti- TNFs had previously failed for
88% of recruited patients. Corticosteroid- free clinical remission
was observed in 29% and 31% of patients following 26 and 52
weeks of vedolizumab therapy, respectively, and clinical response
was  present  in  38%  and  35%  at  these  time  points.  Endoscopic
remission was achieved by 33% and 36% of patients at weeks 26
and  52,  respectively.  Vedolizumab  levels  >10  mg/L  at  week  22
were associated with endoscopic remission at week 26.136

The  recommendation  is  based  on  the  magnitude  thresholds
used to guide decision- making for the BSG guideline and does

not  preclude  the  use  of  these  drugs  in  combination  for  the
management of Crohn’s disease, presuming agreement with the
patient and the wider IBD MDT.

OTHER THERAPIES IN CROHN’S DISEASE
GRADE statement: Antibiotics
Summary  of  evidence:  Thirteen  RCTs  (n=1303  participants)
were included in the analyses.456 Two trials were rated as high
risk of bias (no blinding). Seven trials were rated as unclear risk
of bias, and four trials were rated as low risk of bias. Compari-
sons included ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) versus placebo,
rifaximin (800 to 2400 mg daily) versus placebo, metronidazole
(400 mg to 500 mg twice daily) versus placebo, clarithromycin
(1  g/day)  versus  placebo,  cotrimoxazole  (960  mg  twice  daily)
versus  placebo,  ciprofloxacin  (500  mg  daily),  metronidazole
(500 mg daily) and budesonide (9 mg daily) versus placebo with
budesonide  (9  mg  daily),  ciprofloxacin  (500  mg  twice  daily)
versus  5- ASA  (2  g  twice  daily),  ciprofloxacin  (500  mg  twice
daily) with infliximab versus placebo with infliximab, clarithro-
mycin (750 mg daily) and antimycobacterial versus placebo, and
metronidazole (400 mg twice daily) and cotrimoxazole (960 mg
twice daily) versus placebo. The effect of individual antibiotics
on Crohn’s disease was generally uncertain due to imprecision.
The  GRADE  summary  of  findings  is  in  online  supplemental
appendix 4, GRADE table 34.

Thirty‐eight  per  cent  (214/568)  of  participants  exposed  to
antibiotics had at least one adverse event compared with 45%
(128/284)  of  placebo- exposed  participants  (RR=0.87,  95%
CI  0.75  to  1.02;  nine  studies;  high- certainty  evidence).  The
effect of antibiotics on SAEs and withdrawal due to AEs was
uncertain. Two per cent (6/377) of antibiotic participants had
at  least  one  adverse  event  compared  with  0.7%  (1/143)  of
placebo participants (RR=1.70, 95% CI 0.29 to 10.01; three
studies;  low- certainty  evidence).  Nine  per  cent  (53/569)  of
antibiotic  participants  withdrew  due  to  AEs  compared  with
12% (36/289) of placebo participants (R= 0.86, 95% CI 0.57
to  1.29;  nine  studies;  low- certainty  evidence).  The  GRADE
summary  of  findings  is  in  online  supplemental  appendix  4,
GRADE table 34.

Antibiotics are not suggested for induction and
maintenance of remission in patients with moderate to
severe Crohn’s disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: High. Overall
magnitude: Trivial.

Justification: Assessment of efficacy is challenging due
to the sheer number of antibiotics investigated, in various
combinations and doses, within predominantly small studies. No
individual antibiotic or combination agent has been sufficiently
studied to robustly assess. As a therapeutic class, the evidence
is of high certainty that overall antibiotics show a small effect
as induction treatment, but there is no evidence to assess their
efficacy in maintenance. As such, we cannot support their use
as induction or maintenance treatment in moderate to severe
Crohn’s disease.

Implementation considerations: Antibiotics are widely
available but are not recommended. Notably, this assessment
does not address the use of antibiotics in special situations such
as intra- abdominal or perianal sepsis.

Efficacy  induction:  55%  (289/524)  of  antibiotic- exposed
participants  failed  to  achieve  remission  at  6  to  10  weeks
compared with 65% (149/231) of placebo- exposed participants
(RR=0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98; seven studies; high- certainty
evidence).  At  10  to  14  weeks,  41%  (174/428)  of  antibiotic
participants failed to achieve a clinical response compared with
49% (93/189) of placebo participants (RR=0.77, 95% CI 0.64
to 0.93; five studies; moderate- certainty evidence).

Efficacy maintenance: The effect of antibiotics on relapse in
uncertain. Forty‐five per cent (37/83) of participants exposed to
antibiotics relapsed at 52 weeks compared with 57% (41/72) of
placebo- exposed participants (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.47;
two  studies;  low- certainty  evidence).  Relapse  of  endoscopic
remission was not reported in the included studies.

Certainty  and  rationale:  Moderate-  to  high- quality  evidence
suggests that any benefit provided by antibiotics in active Crohn’s
disease  is  likely  to  be  small  or  trivial.  High- quality  evidence
suggests that there is no increased risk of side effects with anti-
biotics compared with placebo. The effect of antibiotics on the
risk of serious side effects is uncertain. The effect of antibiotics
on preventing relapse in Crohn’s disease is uncertain. Thus, no
firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of antibiotics
for maintenance of remission in Crohn’s disease can be drawn.
More research is needed to determine the harms and benefits of
antibiotic therapy in Crohn’s disease.

GRADE STATEMENT: PROBIOTICS
Summary of evidence: There were two studies that met criteria
for inclusion for assessment for the induction of remission.457 458
One study from Germany had 11 adult participants with mild-
to- moderate  Crohn’s  disease,  who  were  treated  with  a  1week-
course  of  corticosteroids  and  antibiotics  (ciprofloxacin  500
mg  twice  daily  and  metronidazole  250  mg  three  times  a  day),
followed  by  randomised  assignment  to  Lactobacillus  rham-
nosus  strain  GG  (two  billion  colony- forming  units  per  day)
or  corn  starch  placebo.  The  other  study  from  the  UK  had  35
adult  participants  with  active  Crohn’s  disease  (CDAI  150  to
450)  randomised  to  receive  a  symbiotic  treatment  (comprised
of freeze- dried Bifidobacterium longum and a commercial probi-
otic) or placebo. The overall risk of bias was low in one study,
whereas  the  other  study  had  unclear  risk  of  bias  in  relation
to  random  sequence  generation,  allocation  concealment  and
blinding. The GRADE summary of findings is in online supple-
mental appendix 4, GRADE table 35.

Seven  small  studies  were  identified  and  included  in  the
Cochrane  review  investigating  clinical  remission  in  Crohn’s
disease.  Studies  varied  according  to  probiotics  tested,  meth-
odological  quality  and  medication  regimen.  No  studies  were
pooled for statistical analysis.

Efficacy  induction:  There  was  no  evidence  of  a  difference
between  probiotics  and  placebo  for  induction  of  remission  in

Probiotics are not suggested for induction and
maintenance of remission in patients with Crohn’s disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty Very low
Overall magnitude: Unknown.

Justification: The evidence is of very low certainty therefore we
are unable to make an informed recommendation.

Implementation considerations: Probiotics are not
recommended in Crohn’s disease.

Crohn’s disease (RR=1.06; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.71; two studies,
46 participants) at 6 months. There was no difference in adverse
events  between  probiotics  and  placebo  (RR=2.55;  95%  CI
0.11  to  58.60;  two  studies,  46  participants).  The  evidence  for
both outcomes was of very low certainty due to risk of bias and
imprecision.459

Efficacy  maintenance:  There  was  no  statistically  significant
benefit of Escherichia coli Nissle for reducing the risk of relapse
compared  with  placebo  (RR=0.43,  95%  CI  0.15  to  1.20),
or  Lactobacillus  GG  after  remission  which  was  surgicallyin-
duced  (RR=1.58,  95%  CI  0.30  to  8.40)  or  medically  induced
(RR=0.83,  95%  CI  0.25  to  2.80).  There  was  no  statistically
significant benefit of probiotics for reducing the risk of relapse
compared  with  maintenance  therapy  employing  5- ASA  or
azathioprine (RR=0.67, 95% CI 0.13 to 3.30). In this study the
probiotic Lactobacillus GG was associated with adverse events.
A  small  study  using  the  yeast  Saccharomyces  boulardii  demon-
strated a difference that was not statistically significant in favour
of  probiotic  combined  with  a  reduced  level  of  maintenance
therapy over standard maintenance treatment alone (RR=0.17,
95% CI 0.02 to 1.23).460

Certainty  and  rationale:  There  is  no  evidence  to  suggest
that probiotics are beneficial for the maintenance of remission
in  Crohn’s  disease.  All  of  the  included  studies  enrolled  small
numbers  of  patients  and  might  have  lacked  statistical  power
to  show  differences,  should  they  exist.  There  is  no  evidence
to suggest that probiotics are beneficial for the maintenance of
remission in Crohn’s disease. Larger trials are required to deter-
mine if probiotics are of benefit in Crohn’s disease.

Table 9 outlines suggested rough estimates of time to achieve
treatment goals after initiation of Crohn’s disease therapies, as
advised by the STRIDE consensus.6 These times could be used as
a guide when deciding on time intervals to monitor for remission
in Crohn’s disease after initiating a new treatment.

USE OF EXCLUSIVE ENTERAL NUTRITION IN CROHN’S
DISEASE
Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) is the term used when a patient
receives  an  exclusively  liquid  diet  for  a  defined  period,  and  is
used routinely in paediatric Crohn’s disease to induce remission
(73%  remission  rates  on  an  intention- to- treat  basis),  but  not
currently in adults.461–463

A Cochrane review,452 including 27 trials, examining EEN for
inducing  remission  in  Crohn’s  disease,  found  no  difference  in

efficacy against steroids, but no conclusions can be drawn due to
very low- certainty evidence.

There are different types of enteral nutrition (elemental, semi-
elemental  (peptide  based)  and  polymeric  (whole  protein))  but
the  efficacy  of  EEN  in  Crohn’s  disease  is  not  affected  by  the
type of formula used or to the route of administration (oral vs
nasogastric tube).464–466

In  the  preoperative  setting,  a  retrospective  UK  case–control
study  showed  that  patients  given  preoperative  EEN  (6  weeks)
had  lower  rates  of  postoperative  abscesses  and  anastomotic
leaks, lower CRP and voided surgery in 25% of cases (13/51).467
A  prospective  single- centre  French  study  of  35  patients  with
Crohn’s  disease  at  high  risk  of  surgical  complications  (with
obstructive symptoms, and/or steroid treatment, and/or preop-
erative weight loss >10%, and/or perforating Crohn’s disease)
were  treated  with  preoperative  EEN  for  a  mean  of  3  weeks
before surgery.468 Postoperative outcomes were compared for 21
patients with Crohn’s disease at low surgical risk. Preoperative
EEN resulted in similar postoperative complication rates in the
high- risk (23.8%) and low- risk (22.9%) patients, suggesting that
preoperative  EEN  is  protective  for  high  surgical  risk  patients
who  require  resection.  Discontinuation  of  steroids  was  also
possible in 10/16 patients (62.5%) receiving EEN.

A  small  case- matched  prospective  Chinese  study  compared
24 patients on EEN for at least 2 weeks before surgery with a
control  group  of  24  patients  who  underwent  surgery  without
receiving preoperative EN or parenteral nutrition. The incidence
of postoperative septic complications was significantly lower in
the EN group (4% vs 25%, p=0.04).469

A  systematic  review,  which  included  seven  studies,  also
suggested  that  preoperative  EEN  may  reduce  the  infectious
complications  of  surgery,  with  a  trend  towards  fewer  patients
requiring stoma formation. Please see table 9 for estimated time
to treatment goals for EEN.470

PERIANAL CROHN'S DISEASE
Perianal  Crohn’s  disease  is  a  distinct  phenotype  characterised
by the presence of at least one fistula tract between the epithe-
lial surfaces of the anal canal, and the perineal skin and/or the
vagina.471 The prevalence of perianal Crohn’s disease has been
reported to range between 20% and 40% and is associated with
significant  morbidity—namely,  debilitating  symptoms  affecting
psychosocial well- being and sexual health.472 473

There is an increased risk of more aggressive rectal and anal
cancer  in  patients  with  chronic  perianal  fistulising  Crohn’s
disease.  The  need  for  surveillance  has  not  been  defined  in
current  guidelines,474  and  the  optimal  intervals  and  modalities
are  unknown.449  475  476  In  the  absence  of  dedicated  consensus
or  guidelines,  we  would  suggest  careful  assessment  at  regular
intervals, and especially when symptoms change, with standard
techniques,  including  endoscopy,  imaging  and  direct  examina-
tion  under  anaesthesia  with  biopsy  of  the  fistulous  tracts  to
detect cancer early and discuss treatment options with the wider

GPS 66: A practical guide for exclusive enteral nutrition
(EEN) to induce remission in Crohn’s disease.

 ⇒ Counsel patients on the risks and benefits of all available

treatment options including EEN.

 ⇒ EEN is provided as a prescribed liquid diet, excluding all food
and drink except still water. Some units allow limited optional
intake beyond this, but there is little evidence supporting
what foods or drinks can be added without affecting efficacy.

 ⇒ Whole protein (polymeric), peptide, semi- elemental or

elemental diets are equally efficacious, but whole protein
feeds are more palatable and are more likely to be tolerated.
 ⇒ EEN is nutritionally complete with all relevant micronutrients

and trace elements included.

 ⇒ Limited palatability and tolerance are often reasons for

failure, so encouragement from the whole MDT is important
for success. This is best achieved with a formalised MDT
pathway for EEN management and specific points of contact
to assess progress.

 ⇒ A starter regimen, increasing the prescribed daily volume
gradually over a few days while reducing food intake, is
important to build up tolerance and prevent the risk of
refeeding, especially in patients where dietary intake has
been suboptimal beforehand, or weight loss has been
significant.

 ⇒ Bloods for refeeding syndrome include urea and electrolytes
(for potassium), phosphate and magnesium, and should be
monitored daily while calorie intake is increased to maximum
in at- risk patients.

 ⇒ A standard target regimen should be based on requirements
for energy: 25–30 kcal/kg/day and protein: 1 g/kg/day. Non-
standard regimens may be used where refeeding syndrome
is a risk (with lower calories), or where catch- up nutrition is
required.

 ⇒ Once the target regimen is met, EEN should be continued for

6–8 weeks to induce mucosal healing.

 ⇒ Once EEN is established, the vast majority of patients can

continue with their usual daily activities.

 ⇒ Most adult patients can tolerate EEN orally; however,

nasogastric feeding may be required if target volumes cannot
be met orally or where feed tolerance is limited with boluses.

 ⇒ Regular monitoring via email or telephone will help to

maintain adherence.

INVESTIGATIONS

Malnutrition screening, nutritional assessment and correction of
nutritional status should be part of preoperative optimisation of
all patients who require abdominal surgery for IBD. Nutritional
support (oral nutritional supplements or enteral or parenteral
nutrition) should be provided as required.

We recommend pelvic MRI as an important adjunct to clinical
assessment and examination under anaesthesia, by an
experienced colorectal surgeon, in evaluation of fistulising
perianal Crohn’s disease. Depending on local availability and
expertise, endoanal ultrasound may have a role.

GPS 68

We recommend that examination under anaesthesia should
include an assessment of the rectal mucosa, as the presence
of proctitis is associated with lower rates of fistula healing in
perianal Crohn’s disease.

The assessment of perianal disease includes pelvic MRI, exam-
ination  under  anaesthesia  (EUA),  and  endoanal  ultrasound
(EAUS). Poor sonographic tissue penetration and pain associated
with perianal disease may limit the use of EAUS for deep- seated
abscesses  and  complex  fistulae.478  479  Furthermore,  EAUS  may
not be available in all IBD treatment centres. MRI is the standard
imaging  modality  in  perianal  disease  in  the  UK.  Radiological
reporting may be enhanced with validated radiological scoring
e.g. MAGNIFI- CD score, among others.480

Multimodal  assessment  with  an  EUA  and  radiological  inves-
tigations increases the diagnostic accuracy, as indolent abscesses
may  be  missed  at  EUA.473  481  Imaging  allows  for  accurate
follow- up,  as  the  closure  of  an  external  fistula  opening  does
not  always  equate  to  remission  of  inflammation  of  the  fistula
tract.482  483  An  EUA  undertaken  by  an  experienced  colorectal
surgeon, carries a sensitivity of 90% in classifying fistulae, sinus
tracks  and  abscesses,  and  allows  for  initiation  of  early  surgical
treatment.477 The presence of proctitis is associated with poorer
surgical outcomes (OR=2.85, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.89, p=0.0001),
underscoring the need for an early endoscopic assessment of the
rectal lumen.484

There are no new studies to alter recommendation since the

publication of the last BSG guidelines.8

MEDICAL AND SURGICAL TREATMENTS FOR PERIANAL
CROHN’S DISEASE

GPS 69

Multidisciplinary decision making should be the standard of care
for patients with perianal Crohn’s disease.

The  management  of  perianal  disease  warrants  a  flexible  thera-
peutic  approach,  to  reflect  the  multidimensional  and  changing
nature  of  the  disease,  preference- sensitive  patient  goals  and
differential  healthcare  professional  expertise,  as  specified  in  a
novel classification (see figure 1).475 Uncertainties and deficien-
cies in the evidence relating to perianal disease, were addressed
in a recent consensus from leading experts, with a high agree-
ment for collaborative multidisciplinary working as a platform
for shared decision- making in this setting.475 485 Other guidelines
support this approach.474 477

SETON INSERTION

GPS 70

We suggest that setons should be placed to prevent sepsis in
fistulising perianal Crohn’s disease. The optimal timing of seton
removal is uncertain and should be based on patient preferences
and complexity of the fistulae.

Guidelines

There is no additional evidence to support placement and timing
of seton removal since the last guidelines.8 The placement of a
seton depends on the complexity of the fistula (eg, high fistula,
rectovaginal fistula), and the presence of proctitis.484

In  the  PISA  study,  participants  with  a  single  high  internal
opening  fistula  were  randomised  to  chronic  seton  drainage
(removal  of  seton  at  1  year),  or  anti- TNF  therapy  alone  or  in
conjunction  with  definitive  surgical  closure  (surgical  closure  is
discussed further below). This study was terminated early owing
to  the  high  prevalence  of  re- intervention  in  the  chronic  seton
drainage group (74% compared with 42% for infliximab mono-
therapy, and 23% with combined anti- TNF and surgery).486 This
implies that benefits of setons drainage are greater in conjunc-
tion with additional advanced medical therapy. The subsequent
PISA- II  study  showed  a  clinical  closure  rate  of  76%  for  the
combined  anti- TNF  therapy  and  reparative  surgery,  where  all
participants  had  seton  placement  at  inclusion.487  An  observa-
tional  study  of  156  patients  treated  with  infliximab  following
seton  placement  found  a  higher  likelihood  of  sustained  fistula
closure in those patients who started anti- TNF therapy within 6
weeks of surgery.488

ROLE OF REPARATIVE SURGICAL THERAPIES IN PERIANAL
CROHN’S DISEASE

GPS 71

Reparative surgical options, such as advancement flap, and
ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT), may be considered
for selected patients in a multidisciplinary setting.

Reparative surgical therapies  aim  to  provide  definitive  surgical
closure  of  the  perianal  fistula.  The  surgical  options  include:
fistulotomy,  mucosal  advancement  flaps,  video- assisted  anal
fistula treatment, fistula plug, ligation of intersphincteric fistula
tract (LIFT) and fistula glue.

The  PISA- II  study  was  the  only  published  surgical  RCT  for
perianal  Crohn’s  disease  since  the  last  BSG  guidelines.  The
study was designed to incorporate the learnings and limitation
of  the  initial  PISA- I  study.486  Patient  without  preferences  were
randomised  to  surgery  (advancement  flap  or  LIFT  procedure)
or anti- TNF therapy (infliximab or adalimumab, with dose esca-
lation permitted). Preference- sensitive patients were allowed to
choose their treatment arm. All participates had seton placement
at study entry with time intervals to study intervention of 8–12
weeks in the surgical arm and 2 weeks in the anti- TNF therapy
group. Seton removal was during the surgical closure procedure
and  6  weeks  after  insertion  for  anti- TNF  therapy,  respectively.
MRI- assessed  fistula  closure  was  higher  for  the  surgery  group
(12%  compared  with  9%,  p=0.005).487  There  is  insufficient
evidence to support the use of other surgical interventions which
may be considered in the setting of future clinical trials.

Mesenchymal  stem  cell  therapy  showed  promising  initial
results  in  achieving  fistula  closure,  especially  when  combined
with  fibrin  glue.489  A  phase  III,  randomised,  double- blind,
parallel  group,  placebo- controlled,  international,  multicentre
study (ADMIRE- CD II) was designed to assess the efficacy and
safety  of  Cx601,  adult  allogeneic  expanded  adipose- derived
stem cells (darvadstrocel) for the treatment of complex perianal
fistulae in Crohn’s disease. This study failed to meet its primary
endpoint of combined remission at 24 weeks.490

GPS 72

We suggest that patients with severe perianal Crohn’s disease
refractory to medical therapy and affecting quality of life should
be offered faecal stream diversion surgery. Patients should be
counselled that the rates of subsequent successful reversal are
low, and proctectomy may ultimately be required.

Refractory perianal Crohn’s disease may present as early and
rapidly  progressive  destructive  disease  or  as  gradually  debili-
tating  symptomatic  fistula(s)  unsuitable  for  surgical  repair.475
Both presentations may cause severe symptoms and profoundly
affect  quality  of  life.  Early  intervention  with  a  defunctioning
ostomy,  and  sometimes  early  proctectomy,  is  required.475  The
risk  of  proctectomy  following  defunctioning  stoma  has  been
reported  to  be  as  high  as  68%  on  long- term  follow- up  of  up
to  103  months.491  although,  a  recent  meta- analysis  found  that
the early use of medical therapies post- faecal diversion, and the
absence of proctitis were associated with a higher likelihood of
restoring  bowel  continuity.492  Post- proctectomy,  poor  wound
healing  may  continue  to  impact  quality  of  life,  with  limited
evidence on the risk of this or on efficacious therapies to avoid
this eventuality.

(69%  responded  at  week  14).  The  RR  ratio  for  induction  of
response was 1.32 (0.54 to 3.22), without corresponding results
for  induction  of  remission.  For  maintenance  of  response  and
remission, the RR ratio was 1.88 (1.23 to 2.88) and 1.79 (1.10
to 2.92), respectively.493

In contrast, a subgroup analysis from two adalimumab studies
reported a RR for induction of response of 0.69 (0.18 to 2.62)
and 0.75 (0.2,2.77), and induction of remission of 0.69 (0.09 to
5.55) and 0.63 (0.06 to 6.41).496 497 The benefits of adalimumab
for induction of response/remission in perianal Crohn’s disease
are uncertain, with wide variations in the magnitude and direc-
tion of the effects. There are no corresponding data for main-
tenance of response, yet a study ny Colombel et al498 reported
maintenance of remission with a RR ratio of 2.57 (1.13 to 5.84),
suggesting superiority over placebo.498

The efficacy of anti- TNF therapy may be related to drug levels,
which were not considered in RCTs. Nevertheless, observational
studies  suggest  that  higher  serum  trough  infliximab  levels  are
associated with better outcomes, with a suggested target of >10
µg/mL  in  one  study.499  This  may  be  achieved  with  escalated
dosing  at  10  mg/kg,  notwithstanding  the  possibility  of  higher
risk of infections.500

Other biologics and small molecules

We recommend that medical therapies should be started
promptly after adequate surgical drainage of perianal abscesses.

In  a  systematic  review  of  published  RCTs,  19  studies  reported
outcomes  for  fistulising  Crohn’s  disease,  summarised  in  meta-
analyses.  Both  enterocutaneous  and  perianal  fistulae  were
included  in  a  few  studies,51  493  and  for  others,  outcomes  were
reported  from  subgroup  analysis  or  post- hoc  analysis.494  The
quality of evidence and uncertainty of outcomes precluded adop-
tion of the GRADE approach to the following recommendations.

Antibiotics
Ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole showed no benefit in fistula
response or remission in perianal Crohn’s disease, yet they may
play a role in the acute setting to manage sepsis, or in conjunc-
tion with advanced medical therapy.495

Anti-TNF therapies

GPS 74

We suggest infliximab as first- line biologic therapy for perianal
Crohn’s disease, to be started as soon as adequate drainage of
sepsis is achieved.

In a sensitivity analysis restricted to studies where the primary
outcomes were fistula- related, pooled data for anti- TNFs (inflix-
imab,  adalimumab,  certolizumab  and  humanised  infliximab
CDP571) showed superiority to placebo for fistula induction of
remission (RR=1.94 95% CI 1.10 to 3.41) and maintenance of
remission (RR=1.79, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.92), supporting a role

Patients with inadequate response to anti- TNF therapies may be
offered other advanced therapies; upadacitinib, ustekinumab or
vedolizumab may be considered.

Post- hoc  pooled  analysis  of  the  ustekinumab  clinical  trials
(UNITI- 1, UNITI- 2 and IM- UNITI, CERTIFI- M) showed supe-
riority  compared  with  placebo  for  fistula  response  (RR=1.80,
95%  CI  1.04  to  3.11).494  Vedolizumab,  when  compared  with
placebo,  showed  evidence  of  efficacy  for  induction  of  fistula
remission  (28%  compared  with  13%)  in  a  post- hoc  subgroup
analysis  of  the  GEMINI- 2  trials,  although  though  this  did  not
reach statistical significance.501

Induction  of  response  and  remission  with  filgotinib  from
subgroup  analysis  of  DIVERGENCE- 2  trial  reported  a  RR
ratio of 1.79 (0.60, 5.31) and 2.50 (0.64, 9.73), respectively.
The post- hoc analysis of data from upadacitinib U- EXCEL and
U- EXCEED trials, included 96 treated patients with different
types  of  fistulae  compared  with  47  in  the  placebo  group
(including  19  who  had  fistulae  at  other  sites).  Upadacitinib
showed  superiority  for  induction  of  response  and  remission
with a RR of 3.67 (91.23 to 10.93) and 3.26 (1.02 to 10.43),
respectively.502

Pooled  outcomes  for  JAK  inhibitors  (upadacitinib  and  filgo-
tinib) for induction of response and remission showed a RR ratio
of 2.56 (95% CI 1.18 to 5.53) and 2.92 (95% CI 1.21 to 7.05)
respectively.494

U- ENDURE  maintenance  data  suggest  that  upadacitinib  is
not as effective for maintenance, but the population was much
smaller (36 for response and 79 for remission).454

WITHDRAWAL OF THERAPY IN CROHN’S DISEASE

GPS 76

Joint decisions regarding drug withdrawal should be taken
in the context of the individual patient, their disease history,
estimated risk of, and predicted consequences of relapse. Patient
preference, disease history, severity and extent are key factors to
guide shared decision- making.

Once  disease  remission  has  been  achieved,  it  is  uncertain  if
long- term immunomodulation is necessary in all patients. Long-
term immunomodulation is associated with high drug costs and
therapy- related adverse events, such as skin reactions, infections
and cancers. Some patients may also want to consider treatment
cessation/holidays  for  a  variety  of  reasons,  such  as  medication
burden/compliance  and  personal  risk  of  cancer  and  infections.
The  risk  of  withdrawing  effective  therapies  include  disease
relapse,  poor  quality  of  life  and  the  consequence  of  relapse.
Re- treatment  following  withdrawal  may  also  lead  to  adverse
events,  such  as  an  increased  risk  of  developing  antibodies  to
infliximab and hypersensitivity reactions.

Before withdrawal of any maintenance IBD therapy is consid-
ered, assessment of disease activity and confirmation of clinical
remission  using  a  combination  of  clinical,  biochemical,  endo-
scopic/histological  and/or  radiological  investigations  should  be
considered  to  inform  the  risks  and  benefits  of  stopping,  while
accepting that even complete remission is associated with sizeable
relapse risk. Nevertheless, several factors have been reported as
being associated with an increased risk of relapse after stepping
down  or  withdrawing  therapy,  although  there  is  inconsistency
between  studies.  For  example,  raised  CRP  and  calprotectin,
persistent  inflammation  on  radiological  imaging503  and  endo-
scopic inflammation at the time of drug withdrawal have all been
reported to be associated with an increased relapse risk.442

We  suggest  that  patients,  in  whom  therapy  is  withdrawn,
should be monitored for evidence of relapse. The optimal moni-
toring strategy following withdrawal of maintenance treatment
has not been defined. Monitoring of clinical symptoms, objective
markers of inflammation, such as CRP/faecal calprotectin, and/or
endoscopy and/or radiology for reassessment seems reasonable.

There  are  good  practice  statements  regarding  withdrawal
of  therapy  within  the  specific  text,  where  there  is  evidence  to
support a statement.

MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL THERAPIES PRIOR TO
SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR CROHN’S DISEASE
It is estimated that intestinal resection surgery is required in 18–31%
of  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  within  5  years  of  diagnosis  and
25–40% within 10 years.504 Surgery is most commonly performed
for  complications  of  Crohn’s  disease—for  example,  stricture
formation, fistulising disease; however, it can also be considered as
an early treatment option for patients with isolated terminal ileal
disease.91 Acute emergency abdominal surgery in Crohn’s disease
should be avoided unless there is peritonism or ischaemia.99

Deferred  surgery  when  the  patient  is  optimised  for  surgery
results  in  lower  complication  rates  and  lower  rates  of  stoma
formation.505  There  is  sufficient  evidence  to  propose  delaying
surgery,  when  possible,  to  allow  a  multimodal  approach  to
management,  including  nutrition,  corticosteroid  weaning  and
management of any abscesses.

Please see further information on management of corticoste-
roids, advanced therapies and immunomodulator agents in the
preoperative period in section 8.31 and 8.32.

Guidelines

Radiologically  guided  drainage  of  abscess  or  collection  is
recommended where possible. It is suggested that surgery should
be avoided for at least 2 weeks after percutaneous drainage.506

Poor preoperative nutritional status has been identified as an
independent risk factor for postoperative intra- abdominal septic
complications  (OR=6.23,  95%  CI  1.75  to  22.52)  in  multivar-
iate  analysis,  with  malnutrition  and  nutrient  deficiencies  being
common in IBD.127 507

Malnutrition screening and nutritional assessment and correc-
tion of nutritional status should be part of preoperative optimis-
ation of all patients who require abdominal surgery for Crohn’s
disease. Those with a low BMI or recent weight loss of >10%
body  weight  are  at  increased  risk  of  surgical  complications,
particularly  intra- abdominal  sepsis  and  increased  mortality.
Obesity is also an independent risk factor for surgical site infec-
tion, readmission and postoperative complication both in adults
and children.508–510 Assessment should be ideally performed by
a dietitian. Albumin level is not a reliable marker of nutritional
status as levels physiologically decrease in the presence of active
disease or infection.99

There  are  few  prospective  studies  of  preoperative  nutrition
support  and  no  prospective  randomised  trials  with  a  non-
nutrition control group. A meta- analysis of preoperative nutri-
tional  support  in  gastrointestinal  surgery  patients  found  that
the provision of 500–1000 kcal of an immune- enhancing oral
nutritional  supplement  plus  usual  food  significantly  reduced
postoperative  complications.511  The  rate  of  postoperative
complications  in  the  group  receiving  preoperative  nutrition
(enteral  nutrition  or  total  parenteral  nutrition)  support  was
20.0% compared with 61.3% in the group who had standard
care  without  nutrition  support  (OR=0.26,  95%  CI  0.07  to
0.99, p<0.001).512

The  European  Society  of  Parenteral  and  Enteral  Nutrition
(ESPEN)  recommends  preoperative  nutritional  support  for
7–10  days  in  patients  who  are  undergoing  major  gastrointes-
tinal surgery and are mildly malnourished.513 A longer duration
is  recommended  for  severely  malnourished  patients,  even  if  it
delays  surgery.513  If  oral  nutritional  supplements  are  not  toler-
ated, then enteral nutrition should be considered, and parenteral
nutrition should only be used when nutritional targets cannot be
delivered by the enteral route.513

SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF CROHN’S DISEASE

GPS 77

We suggest that laparoscopic resection should be
considered in localised ileocaecal Crohn’s disease for those not
responding to, or relapsing after, initial medical therapy, or in
those preferring surgery to initiation or continuation of drug
therapy.

MANAGING STRICTURES

GPS 78

Patients with symptomatic stricturing small bowel Crohn’s
disease should have joint medical and surgical assessment to
optimise medical therapy and plan requirement for surgical
resection or strictureplasty.

Guidelines

GPS 79

We recommend that strictureplasty is an alternative to resection
in patients with small bowel Crohn’s disease strictures shorter
than 10 cm and is useful where there are multiple strictures or
a need to preserve gut length. Longer strictures can be treated
using non- standard strictureplasty techniques.

GPS 80

If there are multiple strictures close to each other in a segment
of bowel and there is adequate remaining healthy bowel, a
single resection may be preferable to multiple strictureplasties.

GPS 81

We suggest prioritising the use of cross- sectional abdominal
imaging and intestinal ultrasound in the diagnosis and
assessment of strictures as well as the use of ileocolonoscopy
in colonic and anastomotic strictures when clinically safe to
perform, with biopsies to exclude dysplasia and aid distinction of
fibrotic from inflammatory strictures.

Strictureplasty, a technique for surgical treatment of small bowel
strictures without loss of bowel length, is indicated with single
or multiple strictures, impending short gut or previous extensive
small bowel resection. The presence of fistulae, fistula- associated
abscesses or possible carcinoma are contraindications. The pres-
ence of active inflammation at the stricture site does not prevent
successful  strictureplasty.  Strictureplasty  is  not  associated  with
increased  reoperation  rates.  There  is  evidence  that  reopera-
tion  rates  may  be  lower  at  strictureplasty  than  resection  sites.
Although  a  systematic  review  and  meta- analysis  of  12  studies
(1026  patients)  from  2020,  showed  an  increased  likelihood  of
disease  recurrence  and  significantly  reduced  recurrence- free
survival  with  strictureplasty  than  for  those  with  bowel  resec-
tion.514  If  multiple  small  bowel  strictures  can  be  dealt  with  by
a single resection in a patient with adequate bowel length else-
where, then this is preferable to avoid a complex multiple stric-
tureplasty procedure. Such decisions have to be individualised,
considering the patient’s condition at the time of surgery (corti-
costeroid  and  immunosuppressive  drug  use,  serum  albumin,
anaemia, nutritional status), potential for postoperative compli-
cations from complex surgery and the risk of future malabsorp-
tion and malnutrition due to short gut.

ASPECTS RELATED TO SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS IN
CROHN’S DISEASE
Non-surgical management of strictures
The  CREOLE  study  evaluated  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease
(n=97) with symptomatic ileal strictures and assessed response to
adalimumab treatment.515 Treatment was successful at week 24
in 64% of patients, defined as an absence of escalation to steroid
therapy, no endoscopic dilatation and no surgery. A prognostic
score  was  constructed.  This  comprised  clinical features  (use  of
immunosuppressive  drugs  at  baseline,  obstructive  symptoms,
severity  and  duration)  and  magnetic  resonance  enterography
features  (length  of  stricture  <12  cm,  an  intermediated  prox-
imal small bowel dilatation (18–29 mm), marked enhancement

GPS 82

We suggest that endoscopic balloon dilatation is an appropriate
treatment for ileocolonic anastomotic strictures less than 4 cm
in length, without sharp angulation and with non- penetrating
disease, although the majority will require repeated dilatation.
Endoscopically accessible ileal strictures are also amenable
to balloon dilatation, but complication rates and recurrence
rates are higher. There is no role for intralesional corticosteroid
injection at the time of dilatation. Long- term data on the impact
of dilatation on surgical resections is lacking. The GDG suggests
a detailed discussion between the clinical teams and patients
before embarking on this therapy.

on  delayed  T1- weighted  sequence  and  absence  of  fistula).  A
higher score was associated with greater likelihood of response
to adalimumab therapy. The authors emphasised the complexity
of assessing inflammation and fibrotic stricturing, which nearly
always occur together, and the value of both clinical and MRI
features in deciding the value of using drug therapy rather than
surgery for small bowel strictures.516 517

A systematic review of intralesional medical therapy identified
six studies reporting outcomes in 134 patients after intralesional
administration  of  corticosteroids.  Case  series  have  described
administration  of  intralesional  infliximab  in  patients  with
primary (n=3) and anastomotic (n=3) strictures).518 All patients
had  an  improvement  in  obstructive  symptoms  and  no  patients
required  surgery  over  a  short  6month-  follow- up  period,  but
there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of intrale-
sional anti- TNF therapy in current practice.

GPS 83

Intra- abdominal abscesses should be treated by antibiotics and,
if possible, radiologically guided percutaneous drainage.











GPS 84



Following treatment of an abdominal abscess in the setting
of non- perianal fistulising Crohn’s disease, joint medical and
surgical discussion is required, but interval surgical resection is
not always necessary.







POST-SURGICAL CROHN’S DISEASE
Post- surgical Crohn’s disease recurrence can be defined as endo-
scopic  recurrence,  clinical  recurrence  and  surgical  recurrence
(ie,  need  for  further  surgery).  Endoscopic  recurrence  is  most
commonly  described  using  the  Rutgeert’s  scoring  system.  Lack
of  agreed  definitions  of  recurrence  in  research  studies  make
comparisons  between  studies  difficult.  It  is  widely  seen  that
Crohn’s  recurrence  occurs  with  high  frequency  after  surgical
resection of diseased bowel. The post519

GRADE STATEMENT: ADVANCED THERAPY FOR POST-
SURGICAL CROHN’ DISEASE
Summary of evidence: A 2019 Cochrane NMA for maintenance
of  surgically  induced  remission  in  Crohn’s  disease,524  which
included 35 RCTs with 3249 participants, was updated as part
of these guidelines. Vedolizumab data are only included in the
updated version. The GRADE summary of findings is in online
supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 36.

Efficacy:  The  2019  NMA  estimated  with  low  certainty
that  adalimumab  and  infliximab  may  be  more  effective  than
placebo  at  preventing  clinical  relapse  (adalimumab  HR=0.1,
0.02  to  0.33;  infliximab:  HR=0.36,  0.02  to  1.74)  and  endo-
scopic relapse (adalimumab HR=0.1, 0.01 to 0.32; infliximab:
HR=0.24,  0.01  to  1.2).  The  updated  NMA  results  showed
with low certainty that adalimumab may have a large effect in
preventing clinical and endoscopic relapses, and infliximab may
have a moderate effect in preventing endoscopic relapse. It also
showed with moderate certainty that vedolizumab probably has
a large effect in preventing endoscopic relapse.

In  an  open  label  study,  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  post-
ileocolonic  resection  with  primary  anastomosis,  who  were
considered  high  risk  for  recurrence  due  to  two  or  more  risk
factors  (young  age  at  diagnosis,  penetrating  disease,  active
smoking,  perianal  disease,  less  than  3  years  from  previous
surgery), were randomised to infliximab (n=10) or adalimumab

Anti- TNF therapy (infliximab or adalimumab) or
vedolizumab are suggested after ileocolonic resection
for patients with Crohn’s disease if there are significant
risk factors for disease recurrence, or patient preference
for early treatment through shared decision-making, or
endoscopic evidence of recurrent disease 6 months post-
surgery.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Large.

Justification: The studies within this context are unique in
Crohn’s disease trials. The NMA enrolled nearly all patients
within the first 90 days post- surgery. Given the significant
relapse rate in placebo or comparator groups, this calls into
question the need to wait for 6 months before starting biologic
therapy to reduce risk of clinical relapse in non- smokers
with no high- risk factors (or motivated patients as part of
shared decisionmaking). Recently, it has been recommended
that regulatory trials assessing effectiveness of therapy for
postoperative recurrence recruit patients within 30 days of
ileocolonic resection,523 further highlighting the discrepancy
between clinical practice assessing disease recurrence at 6
months, and emerging trial data.

Implementation considerations: The GDG has included
patient preference as an indication for initiating early biologic
therapy prior to 6- month surgical anastomotic endoscopic
assessment, as well as risk factors (eg, multiple prior surgeries,
resection for penetrating Crohn’s disease, history of perianal
disease or active smoker). This will need an early clinical
consultation after surgery to discuss and make a decision on
potential maintenance therapy. The choice of agent must be
made on an individual patient basis, with shared decision-
making, taking into account prior experience and exposure. The
GDG recommends post- surgical advanced therapy should be
started within 90 days of surgery where indicated.

Guidelines

(n=10).525 There was no difference in rate of endoscopic, histo-
logic  or  clinical  recurrence  at  12  months.  A  very  similar  trial
compared  infliximab  (n=11)  with  azathioprine  (n=11)  mono-
therapy  using  the  same  inclusion  criteria  for  postoperative
patients with Crohn’s disease deemed high risk.526 At 12 months,
there  was  no  significant  difference  in  endoscopic  ((IFX  9%  vs
azathioprine  40%,  p=NS)  or  clinical  recurrence  (IFX  9%  vs
azathioprine 10%), but histological recurrence was significantly
reduced in the infliximab arm (18% vs 80%, p=0.008).

Four papers included in the NMA compared infliximab with
placebo  in  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  who  had  undergone
ileocolonic  resection.  In  the  USA,  endoscopic  recurrence  at  1
year was lower in patients with Crohn’s disease recruited within
4  weeks  of  resection  and  randomised  to  infliximab  compared
with placebo, (1/11 (9%) vs 11/13 (85%), p=0.0006), despite
significantly more active smokers in the infliximab arm.527 In a
Japanese  cohort  of  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  randomised
within 4 weeks of ileocolonic resection, the primary outcomes
of  12  month  and  36  month  clinical  remission,  defined  by
CDAI<150,  were  significantly  higher  in  patients  receiving
infliximab compared with placebo (100% and 93% vs 69% and
56%,  respectively,  p<0.03).528  The  PREVENT  trial  included
patients  post- ileocolonic  resection  at  high  risk  of  recurrence,
including  multiple  prior  surgeries,  resection  for  penetrating
Crohn’s disease, history of perianal disease or active smoker.529
There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of
clinical recurrence at 76 weeks, but endoscopic recurrence up to
week 76 was significantly reduced in the infliximab arm (17%
had concomitant immunomodulators) compared with placebo
(45/147 (31%) vs 90/150 (60%), p<0.001). In Japan, a multi-
centre trial randomised patients within 4 weeks of ileocolonic
resection to infliximab monotherapy or placebo. The primary
outcome  of  composite  endoscopic  or  clinical  recurrence  at  2
years was significantly reduced in the infliximab arm compared
with placebo (10/19 (53%) vs 18/19 (95%), p=0.0032).529

Data  on  the  use  of  vedolizumab  to  reduce  postoperative
recurrence  are  beginning  to  emerge.  A  retrospective  multicentre
study  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  early  prophylaxis  (within
6  months  since  surgery)  with  biological  therapy,  comparing
anti- TNF  therapy  with  vedolizumab  and  ustekinumab  in  a  real-
world setting. Among 297 patients there was no significant differ-
ence  in  endoscopic  postoperative  recurrence  rates  within  1  year
(anti- TNF  40.2%,  vedolizumab  33%  and  ustekinumab  61.8%).
Patients  treated  with  vedolizumab  and  ustekinumab  were  more
biologic- experienced with higher rates of previous surgery. After
controlling for confounders, no differences in the endoscopic post-
operative recurrence risk were seen between anti- TNF prophylaxis
and  other  groups,  and  combining  immunomodulators  was  not
associated with a lower endoscopic postoperative recurrence.530 A
retrospective ENEIDA cohort study involving 40 patients treated
with ustekinumab and 25 with vedolizumab for the prevention of
postoperative  recurrence  also  showed  that  within  18  months  of
surgery, the incidence of endoscopic postoperative recurrence was
similar at 40% for vedolizumab and 42% for ustekinumab.531

The REPREVIO trial is the first prospective, multicentre RCT
evaluating  vedolizumab  in  the  prevention  of  endoscopic  post-
operative  recurrence  after  ileocolonic  resection.  Patients  who
underwent  surgery  and  had  ≥1  risk  factor  (active  smoking,
prior  surgery,  surgery  for  a  perforating  complication,  previous
exposure to anti- TNFs) were randomised to receive vedolizumab
(n=43) or placebo (n=37) at weeks 0, 8, 16 and 24 after surgery.
Nearly half (49%) of patients were anti- TNF exposed. Patients
on  vedolizumab  had  a  greater  chance  of  endoscopic  remission
(77% vedolizumab vs 38% placebo, p=0.0004) and had lower

Rutgeert’s scores than those on placebo, despite similar rates of
clinical recurrence.532

Certainty  and  rationale:  There  is  low  certainty  of  a  large
magnitude  of  effect  for  adalimumab,  infliximab  and  vedoli-
zumab  in  maintenance  of  postoperative  remission  in  patients
with  Crohn’s  disease.  These  data  arise  from  trials  recruiting
patients  within  the  first  90  days  after  surgery,  highlighting  the
role for early initiation of advanced therapy postoperatively, with
individualised  shared  decision- making  taking  into  account  risk
factors  for  disease  recurrence,  patient  preference  and  previous
medication history,

GRADE STATEMENT: 5-ASAS AND PURINE ANALOGUES FOR
POST-SURGICAL CROHN’S DISEASE
Summary  of  evidence:  Two  2019  Cochrane  reviews  studied
5- ASAs  and  purine  analogues  for  maintenance  of  surgically
induced  remission  in  Crohn’s  disease.533  534  Fourteen  5- ASA
RCTs  with  1867  participants,  and  10  purine  RCTs  with  928
were included. They were also included in the updated NMA for
these guidelines. The GRADE summary of findings is in online
supplemental appendix 4, GRADE table 37.

Efficacy:  The  5- ASA  Cochrane  review  found  low- certainty
results that 5- ASAs may be no different from placebo for preven-
tion  of  clinical  relapse  (RR=0.71,  0.46  to  1.1).  The  review

5-ASA and purine analogues are not suggested for post-
surgical maintenance of remission of Crohn’s disease

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Trivial.

Justification: While 5- ASA and purine analogues data reached
statistical significance in the maintenance of surgically induced
remission with low- certainty evidence, both treatments were
of very trivial magnitude, equating to NNT of 13 and 14,
respectively. Neither had evidence of effect for endoscopic
relapse prevention (due to lack of evidence and very low-
certainty outcomes). The GDG has recommended against the
use of purine analogues monotherapy, or 5- ASA monotherapy
or combination therapy in the prevention of postoperative
disease recurrence. To be clear, there is no evidence to support
or refute this at present, but this reflects the GDG commitment
for clarity, and until such evidence exits, these treatments are
not recommended. The NMA and direct evidence from clinical
practice has also been considered. In clinical practice, 5- ASAs
have little to no role in management of Crohn’s disease,
supported by subgroup expert opinion. The NMA data are not
compelling enough to suggest use of 5- ASAs in post- surgical
maintenance of remission.

This statement represents a move away from purine analogues
for first line post- surgical monotherapy, supported by NMA
results and direct meta- analysis, which suggests that the
magnitude of effect is trivial- to- small for both clinical and
endoscopic outcomes. While 5- ASA monotherapy was also
significantly better than placebo at reducing risk of clinical
relapse, the subgroup did not support a recommendation
for its routine use in post- surgical prophylaxis due to the
precise estimate at trivial for clinical outcomes and the lack of
supporting data on endoscopic remission.

Implementation consideration: For patients already on either
therapy in this context, a discussion should be held to reach a
shared decision before any change in therapy is made.

found moderate- certainty results that purine analogues may lead
to fewer clinical relapses than placebo (RR=0.79, 0.67 to 0.92),
and low- certainty evidence that there may be no difference from
placebo for endoscopic relapse. The results of the updated NMA
showed with low certainty that 5- ASA and purine analogues may
only  be  trivially  effective  compared  with  placebo  for  clinical
relapse, and the data on endoscopic relapse was very uncertain.

Certainty and rationale: There is low- certainty evidence that
purine  analogues  or  5- ASA  monotherapy  may  be  effective  in
maintenance  of  postoperative  remission  in  Crohn’s  disease;,
however,  the  magnitude  of  effect  is  trivial.  Therefore,  purine
analogues  or  5- ASA  monotherapy  is  not  recommended.  We
recommend  individualised  shared  decision- making  to  consider
the  need  to  convert  patients  already  on  5- ASA  or  purine
analogues to anti- TNF or ustekinumab or vedolizumab.

GRADE STATEMENT: OTHER TREATMENTS FOR POST-
SURGICAL CROHN’ DISEASE



















It is suggested that no other treatments are currently
used for maintenance of post-surgical remission in Crohn’s
disease.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Trivial.

Justification: Curcumin evidence is of low certainty for both
clinical and endoscopic relapse showing no difference from
placebo and so this is reflected in the statement.

Other treatments studied (including probiotics, sulfasalazine
(with or without prednisolone), budesonide, antibiotics, vitamin
D) gave low-/very low- certainty outcomes; no statements for or
against can be made.

Implementation considerations: While antibiotics collectively
did not demonstrate statistically significant benefit in NMA
for prevention of postoperative recurrence, expert consensus
supported the use of nitroimidazole antibiotics such as
metronidazole, for 3 months postoperatively, in conjunction with
available evidence.535 In one study, patients within 1 week of
ileocolonic resection were randomised to metronidazole 20 mg/
kg (n=30) or placebo (n=30).536 Colonoscopy after 12 weeks of
treatment showed a trend towards a lower rate of ileal lesions in
patients receiving metronidazole (12/23 (52%) vs 21/28 (75%),
p=0.09) and a significantly lower rate of severe disease (i3–i4)
in those receiving metronidazole (3/23 (13%) vs 12/28 (43%),
p=0.02). A similar study design was employed to test ornidazole,
demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the primary
endpoint of clinical recurrence after 54 weeks (3/38 (7.9%) vs
placebo 15/40 (37.5%), p=0.0046).537 However, the risk of poor
compliance related to the high rate of side effects, including
taste disturbance and gastrointestinal upset, should be noted.

Many patients enquire about the use of over the counter (OTC)
treatments, such as probiotics. The network meta- analyses
demonstrated no magnitude of effect for these therapies.
Equally, the network did not demonstrate adverse safety signals
related to OTC preparations, such as probiotics, curcumin
and vitamin D. These treatments cannot be recommended
by the GDG and should not replace our evidence- based
recommendations above. However, it is unlikely that patient
preference- driven use of these OTC preparation is harmful,
alongside evidence- based advanced therapies.

CROSS IBD SECTION
Drug monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease
A myriad of drug therapies are now in routine use in IBD, mostly
immunosuppressant  in  nature.  Each  of  these  medications  has
specific  recommendations  in  terms  of  monitoring  for  safety,
which  often  include  blood  monitoring.  We  have  attempted  to
summarise  these  recommendations  in  a  single  table  for  ease
of  use  but  would  reiterate  that  these  are  not  newly  generated
recommendations from this guideline but adapted recommenda-
tions from elsewhere (table 10).

Managing side effects of immunomodulators and advanced therapy
No  high- quality  evidence  is  available  on  recommendations
about managing side effects of immunotherapy and biological
therapy  for  IBD,  or  their  management/therapy  withdrawal.
One  recently  published  review  suggests  that  de  novo  cuta-
neous  lesions  (either  psoriasiform,  eczematous  or  lupus- like)
occurring in people affected by IBD while on TNFα inhibitors
require topical management (in cases of eczema or mild psori-
asiform pathology); or discontinuation (in cases of lupus); or
switch to another TNFα inhibitor; or change of biologic class
(in cases of moderate/severe psoriasiform pathology).538 Au et
al  also  suggest  that  assessment  of  de  novo  cutaneous  lesions
arising  in  patients  on  TNFα  inhibitor  treatment  should  be
multidisciplinary.538 Paradoxical articular inflammatory mani-
festations may arise in 5.2% of patients with IBD treated with
TNFα  inhibitors,  without  specific  predictive  factors.  Most

cases are transient and do not require therapy discontinuation,
although  in  a  small  proportion  (1.8%)  paradoxical  articular
manifestations represent the onset of de novo spondyloarthop-
athies (SpA).539 In one retrospective study,540 vedolizumab was
associated  with  46%  lower  risk  (HR=0.54;  95%  CI  0.35  to
0.83)  of  serious  infections  in  comparison  with  TNFα  inhib-
itors.  However,  this  was  restricted  to  ulcerative  colitis,  and
the  authors  observed  no  significant  differences  when  they
analysed  cases  of  Crohn’s  disease.  One  review  performed  in
2023540 confirmed such findings. The review by Solitano et al
also found that ustekinumab was associated with lower risk of
serious  infections  in  comparison  with  TNFα  inhibitors  (OR,
0.49;  95%  CI,  0.25  to  0.93;  I2=16%)  and  when  compared
with vedolizumab (OR=0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93; I2=67%).
Another  retrospective  study541  found  that  methotrexate
(either  oral  or  subcutaneous  injection  formulations)  was  less
well tolerated than purine analogues, though no comparisons
with other drugs were performed. Notably, patients with IBD
on methotrexate were older, had had longer disease duration
and  were  more  likely  to  be  refractory  to  previous  immune-
modulatory  treatments.  The  results  of  another  retrospective
study542  suggest  that  patients  with  IBD  on  treatment  with
azathioprine or methotrexate are less likely to experience infu-
sion reactions to infliximab. Our group would like to highlight
that no high- quality studies were available to retrieve evidence
to address this topic. The scarcity of medical literature on this
specific matter brings to the attention of the gastroenterology
community one scientific unmet need.

Guidelines

5-ASA therapy
5- ASAs  are  a  widely  available  and  generally  well- tolerated
medication.  The  choice  of  5- ASA  should  be  determined  by
local  access,  disease  location,  patient  preference  (eg,  tablets  vs
granules) and cost. Once established on oral medication, brand-
specific  prescribing  should  continue.  Brand  specificity  is  not
required for rectal products, but preferences can be considered
for ease of use. The lowest effective maintenance dose should be
used, and/ or topical therapy as appropriate.

preceding  3month- period.  Risk  prediction  scoring  systems
have  been  proposed  but  require  further  investigation.550–552
Despite this, the evidence is currently insufficient to recommend
continuing  VTE  prophylaxis  post  discharge.  Patients  admitted
for elective surgery are at an increased risk of VTE during their
admission and following discharge.553 It is routine practice in UK
to extend VTE prophylaxis post discharge after major abdom-
inal luminal surgery.

GPS 85

GPS 86

Monitoring of patients on oral 5- ASA should include baseline full
blood count; renal and hepatic function testing which should be
used with caution in mild to moderate impairment and avoided
in severe impairment. Blood test monitoring for full blood count,
renal and liver function should be repeated at 3 months, then
annually, but adjusted for individual patient factors, such as
baseline results, polypharmacy and comorbidity.

Corticosteroids and bone density
No  new  evidence  is  available  on  recommendations  about  the
timing of appropriate BMD evaluation, and how to manage low
BMD, in patients affected by IBD. Guidance on management of
osteoporosis in the UK is available from the National Osteopo-
rosis  Guideline  Group  (NOGG)  website.  Diet  and  nutritional
status both contribute to low BMD as risk factors and are rele-
vant to its management. The scarcity of new medical literature
on  this  specific  matter–and  the  lack  of  IBD- specific  references
in  regards  with  the  suggested  timings  of  assessment  of  BMD/
management of low BMD–- brings to the attention of the gastro-
enterology  community  one  underinvestigated  field  where  new
research will be welcome. Our group felt that cross- referencing
to the NICE clinical guideline CG146, published in August 2012
(and  last  updated  in  February  2017)  would  be  useful  to  the
readership.

Efficacy and safety of thromboprophylaxis during and after
hospitalisation
The  risk  of  venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  in  patients  with
IBD  appears  to  be  two  times  greater  (95%  CI  1.72  to  2.39)
than in patients without IBD.543 In patients with IBD admitted
to  hospital  for  any  reason  the  risk  is  approximately  1.5  times
greater than for inpatients without IBD.544–546

The  risk  of  VTE  increases  significantly  in  patients  with
IBD with active inflammation.547 VTE risk in these patients is
increased  compared  with  healthy  controls  (HR=8.4,  95%  CI
5.5 to 12.8, p<0.0001). When considering only the subgroup
of  patients  admitted  to  hospital,  the  additional  risk  of  VTE
conferred  by  active  IBD  was  lower  (HR=3.2,  95%  CI  1.7  to
6.3,  p=0.0006),  probably  because  of  VTE  prophylaxis.548
Prophylactic use of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin
is  therefore  recommended  during  hospital  admissions.  It  is
important to note  that this  does not precipitate or exacerbate
colonic bleeding and patients with ASUC should all receive VTE
prophylaxis.39 549

The  risk  of  VTE  does  not  resolve  on  hospital  discharge.
Patients  admitted  with  active  inflammation  have  a  persistently
increased risk for 60–90 days. Key risk factors include prolonged
length of stay, advancing age, emergency admission type, ulcer-
ative  colitis  and  multiple  previous  admissions  for  IBD  in  the

All patients with inflammatory bowel disease admitted for acute
medical illness or surgery should receive pharmacological VTE
prophylaxis unless contraindicated.

Surgery in IBD

GPS 87

Patients undergoing IBD surgery need support of the wider MDT.
This should include, where possible, IBD physicians, surgeons,
radiologists, dietitians, psychologists and peer support.

In  elective  surgery,  patients  with  IBD  should  have  their  condi-
tion assessed and optimised prior to surgery. This should include
assessment of comorbidities, imaging or endoscopy to document
disease  extent,  drainage  of  abscesses  and  treatment  of  sepsis,
assessment and correction of nutritional deficiencies, and stop-
ping  corticosteroids  and  biologics,  where  possible.  All  patients
with  IBD  undergoing  surgery  should  follow  an  enhanced
recovery protocol.91 504

Corticosteroids in the perioperative period
Patients undergoing IBD surgery while on corticosteroids have
an increased risk of postoperative infectious complications, VTE
and  anastomotic  leak.554  There  is  some  evidence  that  risks  are
greater  for  those  taking  high- dose  steroids  (≥40  mg  predniso-
lone).328 330 A comparison of prednisolone doses >20 mg vs ≤20
mg did not show a significant difference in risk of infections.327
In the setting of proctocolectomy, the use of use of ≥20 mg pred-
nisolone is associated with increased risk of complications.331 332
Patients with IBD having elective surgery should have corticoste-
roids stopped, if possible, or brought to as low a dose as can be
managed without deterioration. This advice does not pertain to
patients who are being managed for ASUC – please see section
5.6 for additional information.

Patients who are on corticosteroids at the time of IBD surgery
should be given the equivalent dose of intravenous hydrocorti-
sone until they can resume oral prednisolone.329 Prednisolone 5
mg  is  equivalent  to  hydrocortisone  20  mg  or  methylpredniso-
lone 4 mg. There is no value increasing steroid dosage to cover
stress in the perioperative period, as shown in a randomised trial
in IBD surgery333 and a case series.334 Anaesthetists will generally
give a single steroid dose prior to induction (such as dexameth-
asone  4  mg  intravenously  or  intramuscularly)  for  those  taking
more than 5 mg prednisolone.335 Patients who are on physiolog-
ical corticosteroid replacement because of disorders of the hypo-
thalamic pituitary axis (such as oral hydrocortisone 20 mg in the
morning, 10 mg mid- day) should receive supplementary doses in
the perioperative period.336 For patients who have had complete
resection of active disease, it is important to avoid inappropriate
prolongation of steroids after surgery, and there is virtue in stan-
dardised  steroid- taper  protocols  in  the  postoperative  period,
dependent on the dose and duration of steroids preoperatively,
with clear communication between patient, medical and surgical
teams about postoperative medication plans.

GPS 89

Patients with IBD who have been on oral corticosteroids for
more than 4 weeks prior to surgery should receive an equivalent
intravenous dose of hydrocortisone while nil by mouth in the
perioperative period.

GPS 90

For non- emergency surgery in Crohn’s disease or ulcerative
colitis, corticosteroids should be stopped preoperatively, or dose
minimised, wherever possible, to reduce risk of postoperative
complications.

Immunosuppressive agents in the perioperative period

GPS 91

Immunosuppressive agents (purine analogues and methotrexate)
and biological agents can be continued in the perioperative
period in patients requiring IBD surgery.

With one exception, the literature on the use of immunosuppres-
sive therapy (purine analogues and methotrexate) leading up to
surgery does not describe an association with an increased risk of

postoperative complications.328 330 Anti- TNF impairs neutrophil
chemotaxis, which raises concern about the impact it might have
on infection rates post- surgery.555

Numerous  single- centre  retrospective  studies  and  meta-
analyses  of  predominately  Crohn’s  disease  observational
cohorts have been published, with conflicting results, with some
suggesting  an  increased  risk  of  postoperative  complications
(surgical  site  infection  and  postoperative  infection)  in  patients
receiving anti- TNF therapy and other studies showing no asso-
ciation.556 557

Two large prospective studies are reassuring. In PUCCINI, a
prospective multicentre observational US study of 947 patients
with IBD (640 Crohn’s disease, 382 anti- TNF exposed) the rates
of any infection, including surgical site infection, were similar in
both  anti- TNF  exposed  and  unexposed  patients  irrespective  of
anti- TNF drug concentration.339

The  French  Remind  Study  of  209  patients  with  Crohn’s
disease  undergoing  ileocaecal  resection  found  that  preopera-
tive anti- TNF therapy (regardless of the serum level or the time
interval between last administration and surgery) was not associ-
ated with postoperative complications.439

Some  early  reports  raised  concerns  that  vedolizumab  use  in
the  perioperative  period  may  increase  the  risk  of  surgical  site
infections.355  558  However,  larger  more  recent  studies,  which
have  taken  into  account  disease  severity  and  type  of  surgery,
are  reassuring,  showing  no  increased  risk  of  postoperative  or
infectious complications in patients exposed to vedolizumab in
the  preoperative  period.559–561Although  prospective  studies  are
lacking regarding the safety of ustekinumab in the perioperative
period, the two largest retrospective studies,562 563 including 44
and 66 patients on ustekinumab, respectively, did not show an
increased risk of surgical complications. A meta- analysis of 172
patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  whose  last  dose  of  ustekinumab
was  at  most  16  weeks  prior  to  surgery  found  similar  compli-
cation  rates  (including  surgical  site  infection,  intra- abdominal
sepsis and readmission) to those of patients exposed to anti- TNF
agents.564

In  a  further  meta- analysis  of  3225  patients  with  Crohn’s
disease,  332  of  whom  received  ustekinumab  preoperatively,
there was no evidence of difference in the overall complications
(OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.23), p=0.37, I2=40%) between
Crohn’s  disease  patients  who  had  ustekinumab  preoperatively
and those who had no ustekinumab. There was also no differ-
ence  in  infectious  complications  (OR=1.15,  95%  CI  0.86  to
1.53), p=o.35, I2=2%).565 These studies support continuation of
biologics and immunosuppressants in the perioperative period.

Regarding  the  safety  of  JAK  inhibitors  in  the  operative
setting, there is one retrospective review of 53 patients exposed
to  tofacitinib  within  4  weeks  of  total  colectomy  for  refractory
ulcerative  colitis.  13.2%  of  patients  had  a  VTE,  and  it  was
suggested  that  prolonged  VTE  prophylaxis  should  be  used  in
these  patients.562  563  There  are  no  available  data  on  other  JAK
inhibitors or small molecules at present, and this is an area where
future research is required.

SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR SUPERADDED
INFECTIOUS COLITIS
New  onset  or  worsening  of  symptoms  in  IBD  should  be  scru-
tinised  to  discern  disease  relapse  from  superinfections,  which
should be promptly identified and treated prior to initiation or
alterations of any immunosuppressive therapies.

Moderate to severe activity in IBD, immunosuppressive medi-
cations,  poor  nutrition,  comorbidities,  including  congenital
and  acquired  immunodeficiencies,  and  age  can  be  risk  factors

Guidelines

for  infections.203  A  thorough  history,  including  travel,  recent
courses of antibiotics, changes in immunosuppressive therapies,
contact history and social history including diet and sexual prac-
tice, should be sought. All patients presenting with worsening of
symptoms or refractory disease should have stool cultures sent
for microscopy and culture. Testing for ova, cysts and parasites
is  recommended  according  to  local  policies  and  travel  history.
Details  of  appropriate  returning  travellers  should  be  discussed
with  the  local  infectious  diseases  team.  In  those  with  relevant
sexual history, rectal swabs for sexually transmitted diseases and
repeat HIV testing or referral to genitourinary medicine clinics
should be considered.

GPS 92

CMV infection in patients who are hospitalised with flares in
ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease should be treated with intra-
venous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily for 5–10 days, followed
by valganciclovir 900 mg daily until completion of a 2–3 week
course.203  Unless  there  is  evidence  of  disseminated  CMV  reac-
tivation  illness,  immunosuppressive  therapies  for  IBD  should
be continued to minimise relapse of IBD. Full blood count and
renal  function  should  be  closely  monitored  as  neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injuries are associated with
antiviral therapy. Evidence of disseminated systemic CMV reac-
tivation (fever, meningoencephalitis, pneumonitis, oesophagitis
or hepatitis) requires cessation of all immunosuppressive thera-
pies, prompt initiation of intravenous ganciclovir and discussion
with local infectious diseases team.

Patients with new or worsening symptoms of IBD should have
stool cultures for enteroinvasive bacterial infections and stool
Clostridioides difficile assay. Careful review of travel and contact
history should be taken, with microscopy culture and microscopy
for amoebic and/or Shigella dysentery sent in patients with
relevant travel history.

GPS 94

Where a decision has been made to treat CMV, intravenous
ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily for 5–10 days should be given,
followed by valganciclovir 900 mg daily until completion of a
2–3 week course.

CYTOMEGALOVIRUS
Cytomegalovirus  (CMV)  can  be  present  in  up  to  10–30%  of
patients  with  steroid  refractory  IBD566  and  is  associated  with
poor  outcomes,  such  as  recurrent  flares,  toxic  megacolon  and
need for surgery. Purine analogues are an independent risk factor
for CMV reactivation.

Patients  requiring  hospitalisation  for  active  IBD,  and  outpa-
tients  with  moderate  to  severe  disease  refractory  IBD  not
responding  to  immunosuppressive  therapy,  should  be  inves-
tigated  for  CMV.  Diagnosing  active  CMV  can  be  challenging.
Serum antigen and PCR tests do not correlate with colonic infec-
tion;  therefore,  we  recommend  gastrointestinal  tissue  immu-
nohistochemistry  or  PCR.567  Haematoxylin  and  eosin  staining
(H&E) for inclusion bodies has poor sensitivity when compared
with these techniques.

GPS 93

Patients with IBD flare requiring hospitalisation and outpatients
with moderate to severe refractory IBD not responding to
immunosuppressive therapies should have colonic tissue sent for
CMV immunohistochemistry or PCR.

Site  and  number  of  biopsies  influence  the  yield  of  CMV.
Sampling  from  actively  inflamed  areas  and  from  multiple
segments  of  colon  will  increase  the  likelihood  of  capture.  A
minimum of 11 and 16 samples from the left colon in ulcerative
colitis  and  Crohn’s  disease,  respectively,  was  recommended  by
one study.568

The  decision  to  treat  CMV  reactivation  should  consider
patient  history,  serological  findings  (antigen/DNA  titre,  leuco-
penia, low platelet count and elevated liver enzymes) and tissue
viral load. Low- level serological reactivation of CMV in patients
on immunosuppressive therapy often does not need treatment.
There is no clear threshold as to when to treat CMV reactiva-
tion; however, steroid refractoriness, high tissue viral load and
systemic  illness  warrant  treatment.  Discussion  with  the  local
microbiology team may also aid decision to treat.

Clostridioides difficile infection associated with IBD
A  diagnosis  of  IBD  is  an  independent  risk  factor  for  C.
difficile  infection,  independent  of  co- prescription  of  PPI
or  antibiotics.5  The  incidence  of C.  difficile  is  significantly
higher in patients with active disease than in those in remis-
sion.569  C.  difficile  infection  in  IBD  contributes  to  higher
rates  of  colectomy,  postoperative  complications  and  higher
mortality.570  571  Colonic  involvement  and  use  of  biologics
and antibiotics are risk factors for developing C. difficile in
patients with IBD.571

There  are  a  number  of  different  assays  available  when
screening  for  C.  difficile  infection.  Glutamate  degydrogenase
(GDH) antigen is used to detect C. difficile organism, and molec-
ular methods such as nucleic acid amplification technology tests
detect  the  presence  of  toxin  genes.572  Enzyme  immunoassays
(EIA)  and  cytotoxicity  neutralisation  assay  are  used  to  detect
C.  difficile  toxin.  Given  the  cost  of  highly  sensitive  assays,
most laboratories carry out two- step procedures, such as GDH
antigen  testing  (highly  sensitive)  followed  by  toxin  A/B  EIA
(highly  specific).  Please  liaise  with  local  laboratories  to  under-
stand which assays are used.

As part of the disease activity assessment in IBD, stool samples
should be sent for C. difficile infection. Vancomycin or fidaxo-
micin are recommended for 10 days for treating non severe C.
difficile  infection.  Intravenous  metronidazole  should  be  added
for 10 days in severe cases.203 Faecal microbiota transplantation
should be considered as a treatment option in cases of recurrent
C. difficile infection. A systematic review containing nine cohort
studies, comprising a total of 346 patients with IBD and C. diffi-
cile patients who were treated with, FMT concluded that there is
no difference in cure rate between the IBD and non- IBD popula-
tion.573 Another systematic review containing 457 patients with
C.  difficile  and  IBD  reported  overall  pooled  cure  rate  of  88%
compared with IBD flare after FMT in 26.8%.574 Other system-
atic reviews have reported similar success rates with low adverse
events.574 575

Decisions surrounding continuing immunosuppressive thera-
pies should take into consideration the severity of the C. difficile
infection and IBD activity.

GPS 95

C. difficile infection should be treated with vancomycin or
fidaxomicin for 10 days in non- severe cases in accordance with
local trust guidelines. Addition of intravenous metronidazole
should be considered in hospitalised patients with severe
infection with microbiologist guidance.

GPS 96

FMT should be considered for treatment refractory or recurrent
C. difficile on an individual basis in patients with IBD.

GPS 97

Patients with IBD who have travelled for long periods or lived
in endemic areas may be at increased risk of parasitic infections
and should have Strongyloides serology and eosinophil count
checked before starting anti- TNF therapy.

IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA
Summary of evidence: A Cochrane review of treatment of iron
deficiency anaemia in IBD included 11 studies (1670 randomised
participants).576 The studies compared intravenous iron sucrose
versus oral iron sulphate (two studies); oral iron sulphate versus
oral iron hydroxide polymaltose complex (one study); oral iron
fumarate  versus  intravenous  iron  sucrose  (one  study);  intra-
venous  ferric  carboxymaltose  versus  intravenous  iron  sucrose
(one study); erythropoietin injection+intravenous iron sucrose
versus intravenous iron sucrose+injection placebo (one study);
oral  ferric  maltol  versus  oral  placebo  (one  study);  oral  ferric
maltol  versus  intravenous  ferric  carboxymaltose  (one  study);
intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus oral iron sulphate (one
study);  intravenous  iron  isomaltoside  versus  oral  iron  sulphate
(one  study);  erythropoietin  injection  versus  oral  placebo  (one

We suggest treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in
patients in remission should be with one tablet per day
of iron. If not tolerated or effective, consider either
reducing to one tablet every other day, alternative oral
preparations or, if required, parental iron.

Recommendation: Conditional. Overall certainty: Low. Overall
magnitude: Trivial difference comparing intravenous and
oral for success.

Justification: The overall certainty of evidence is low, although
certainty of evidence for the safety data is very low due to
sparse events. There was only a trivial difference between
intravenous and oral preparations of iron for response.
Therefore, given the practical, feasibility and cost advantages
of oral iron supplementation, it is proposed as the suggested
treatment. Data on tolerability is of very low certainty so no
recommendations may be made.

Implementation considerations: We suggest initial treatment
with oral iron if this is tolerated. If this is not tolerated
intravenous iron should be supplemented.

Guidelines

study).  The  GRADE  summary  of  findings  is  in  online  supple-
mental appendix 4, GRADE table 38.

All  studies  compared  participants  with  Crohn’s  disease  and
ulcerative colitis together, as well as considering a range of disease
activity states. The primary outcome of number of responders,
was defined as those with an increase in haemoglobin of 20 g/L
in all but two studies, in which an increase of 10 g/L was used.

An analysis of all intravenous iron preparations versus all oral
iron  preparations  showed  that  intravenous  administration  may
lead to more responders (368/554 vs 205/373, RR=1.17, 95%
CI  1.05  to  1.31,  NNTB=11,  low  certainty  due  to  risk  of  bias
and  inconsistency).  Withdrawals  due  to  adverse  events  may  be
greater in oral iron preparations versus intravenous (15/554 vs
31/373, RR=0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.74, low certainty due to
risk of bias, inconsistency and imprecision).

Certainty and rationale: Oral iron as ferric maltol may lead to
more people having resolution of iron deficiency than placebo
treatment. It is unclear whether there is any difference between
any of the other treatments studied for treating iron deficiency
anaemia.  It  is  unclear  whether  there  is  any  difference  in  any
adverse events between all the therapies tested.GPS

GPS 98 Recommendations for managing iron deficiency
anaemia in IBD.

 ⇒ Iron deficiency anaemia is very common in patients with

active IBD – often resulting in significant morbidity

 ⇒ As systemic inflammation inhibits absorption of iron, iron

tablets should not be used in those with active disease and,
in patients with inactive disease, no more than 100 mg
elemental iron should be taken daily.

 ⇒ Ferritin levels up to 100 µg/L in the presence of inflammation
may still reflect iron deficiency. Measurement of transferrin
saturation may therefore be helpful.

 ⇒ Other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 and folate

deficiency, marrow suppression due to anaemia of chronic
disease and overt blood loss, should be considered and
managed accordingly.

 ⇒ Treatment of IDA should be with one tablet per day of iron. If
not tolerated, a reduced dose of one tablet every other day,
alternative oral preparations or parenteral iron should be
considered.

What treatments can be used for iron deficiency anaemia in adult
patients with IBD, independently of treatments to achieve or
maintain remission?
Iron  deficiency  anaemia  is  a  common  systemic  complication
of  IBD—particularly  with  active  IBD—causing  significant
morbidity with consequential impacts on quality of life. Other
causes  of  anaemia,  such  as  vitamin  B12  and  folate  deficiency,
bone  marrow  suppression  due  to  anaemia  of  chronic  disease,
and overt blood loss may contribute to the anaemic state. These
should be considered and managed accordingly.577

The  ECCO  guidelines  on  the  diagnosis  and  management  of
iron deficiency and anaemia in IBD recommend that iron tablets
should  not  be  used  in  patients  with  active  disease,  as  systemic
inflammation inhibits the absorption of iron. For patients with
inactive  disease,  no  more  than  100  mg  elemental  iron  should
be taken daily. Ferritin levels up to 100 µg/L in the presence of
inflammation may still reflect iron deficiency, therefore measure-
ment of transferrin saturation may still be helpful.577

Guidelines

Oral  iron  tablet  therapy  should  be  limited  to  one  tablet  to
be  taken  once  daily/alternate  days  to  improve  absorption  and
tolerance. If oral iron is not tolerated and patients with IBD have
moderate to severe iron deficiency anaemia (Hb<100 g/L), then
intravenous iron should be used.577

In  a  review576  of  interventions  for  treating  iron  deficiency
anaemia in IBD, various intravenous and oral iron preparations
were evaluated. An updated review is summarised in the findings
table. Overall, the data were limited owing to a low number of
suitable  studies.  Intravenous  iron  was  found  to  be  better  than
oral  iron  in  terms  of  the  number  of  responders;  9.3%  more
(2.2%–17%, GRADE: certainty of evidence is low, effect range
trivial  to  small),  with  trivially  (5.1%)  fewer  withdrawals  from
therapy due to adverse events (2.1%–6.6%, GRADE: certainty
of evidence is very low). However, serious adverse events with
intravenous  iron  were  worse  (3.5%  more)  than  with  oral  iron
(0.6%–10.4%,  GRADE:  certainty  of  evidence  is  low,  effect
range trivially more to moderately more). The data for change in
haemoglobin (with treatment), compliance, and tolerability was
very uncertain (GRADE: certainty of evidence is very low).576

Fatigue  as  a  stand- alone  symptom  in  patients  with  IBD  is  a
challenging symptom to manage when reversible causes such as
anaemia,  hypothyroidism,  and  active  IBD  inflammation  have
been addressed. In a 2020 Cochrane review, interventions such
as  cognitive  behavioural  therapy,  physical  activity,  and  phar-
macological  therapies  such  as  iron  were  evaluated.  Owing  to
insufficient data, no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and
safety of interventions could be drawn.578

Pre-conception, pregnancy and post-partum IBD
Pre-conception counselling
In counselling patients aiming to get pregnant and delivering a
healthy baby, the key message is “healthy mum, healthy baby”.
An  early  discussion  about  conception  and  pregnancy  should
occur in all women of childbearing age with IBD to reduce the
risk  of  voluntary  childlessness.  The  consultation  should  focus
on  addressing  the  patient’s  concerns,  patient  education  and  a
review of general health with the aim of disease remission prior
to  conception.  It  is  well  known  that  medication  adherence,
smoking  cessation  and  pregnancy  outcomes  are  improved  in
those who receive pre- conception counselling.579

Patients with IBD worry about passing on their disease to their
children,  and  these  concerns  should  be  explored.  In  a  Danish
population  study,  the  familial  risk  was  higher  in  first- degree
relatives  of  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease,  almost  an  eightfold
increased  risk,  compared  with  ulcerative  colitis,  which  had  a
fourfold increased risk.580 Offspring of one affected parent have
a 10% risk of inheriting IBD, which increases to 30% when both
parents are affected.581 Patient education is key as many women
continue to proceed with voluntary childlessness, affecting 17%
of 1324 women in a UK study, which in part was due to poor
disease  knowledge.582  Counselling  should  also  be  provided  to
male patients with IBD and they should be advised to continue
their  medication  when  indicated.  However,  patients  on  sulfas-
alazine  affected  by  subfertility  should  switch  this  therapy  to
5- ASA if possible. Similar to non- IBD patients, cases of subfer-
tility should be referred to the appropriate specialist services at
a suitable time.

Disease activity
A  2013  meta- analysis  of  14  studies  showed  that  both  patients
with ulcerative colitis (10 studies, n=1130) and Crohn’s disease
(six studies, n=519) who conceived with clinically active disease

GPS 99: General guidance on pregnancy in patients with
IBD.

Pre- conception:
 ⇒ Education: Importance of keeping well (‘you need to be well
for your baby to be well’). Discuss potential adverse foetal
outcomes of uncontrolled IBD (eg, pre- term birth and low
birth weight), the risk of disease relapse versus risk of taking
medication during pregnancy.

 ⇒ Explore concerns: such as risk of disease inheritance.
 ⇒ General health: advise folic acid (400 μg/day for everyone
and 5 mg/day for those taking sulfasalazine, those with
significant small bowel resections or active small bowel
disease), nutrition, cervical smear, smoking cessation and
vaccinations.

 ⇒ Disease assessment: Is the patient as well as possible
with their IBD? Consider objective assessments: faecal
calprotectin, endoscopy and small bowel non- ionising
imaging in small bowel Crohn’s disease. If necessary, escalate
treatment.

 ⇒ Remission: Aim for a minimum of 3 months' remission prior

to conception.

 ⇒ Medication: Is the patient receiving the safest possible

combination of medicines for pregnancy? Pre- conception
advice regarding vitamin D and folic acid supplementation.

 ⇒ Stop methotrexate, JAK inhibitors or S1P inhibitors >3

months prior to conception.

 ⇒ Individual plan for disease monitoring and management

during pregnancy.
During pregnancy:
 ⇒ Treat both maintenance and relapses as normal with 5- ASA,
purine analogues, biologics (most safety data for anti- TNF,
less but reassuring data for vedolizumab and ustekinumab),
nutrition and steroids. Indications for surgery in pregnant
women with IBD are the same as for non- pregnant patients.

 ⇒ Use therapies with the best evidence base for safety in

pregnancy.

 ⇒ Use imaging as needed, but minimise radiation exposure
with emphasis where possible on ultrasound and MR.
Essential endoscopic investigations only when needed for
clinical decision- making. Avoid the use of gadolinium as part
of MR enterography during pregnancy.

 ⇒ VTE prophylaxis for hospitalised patients, and outpatients
with active IBD, for the duration for the third trimester.779

 ⇒ Involve the IBD MDT where required.
 ⇒ All patients with IBD should be assessed at least once in a

consultant- led obstetric clinic. Joint IBD antenatal clinics may
offer optimal care.780

 ⇒ Mental health screening and referral to appropriate services

before, during and after pregnancy.

Delivery and post partum:
 ⇒ Mode of delivery should be determined by obstetric
considerations and patient preference, except for
active perianal disease, and ileoanal pouch or ileorectal
anastomosis where caesarean section is often preferred.

 ⇒ VTE prophylaxis is important after caesarean section.
 ⇒ Medicines low risk in pregnancy are also low risk in breast

feeding and should continue.

 ⇒ Breast feeding is the preferred method of feeding and does

not affect the course of IBD.

 ⇒ Postpone live vaccinations for the infant for the first 12

months in those who had biologic exposure in pregnancy.592

had a twofold increased risk of disease relapse during pregnancy
compared with those in clinical remission. In a prospective study
of 229 Dutch women with IBD (157 Crohn’s disease, 66 ulcer-
ative  colitis,  and  6  IBD  unidentified,  active  disease  at  concep-
tion had a nearly fourfold risk of ongoing disease activity and/or
new relapses during pregnancy (RR=3.8, 95% CI 2.8 to 5.2).583
Patients with ulcerative colitis relapsed more often during preg-
nancy  than  those  with  Crohn’s  disease  (aOR=3.71,  95%  CI
1.86  to  7.40).583The  increased  risk  of  relapse  with  ulcerative
colitis has been shown in other studies. The 2021 pregnancy IBD
and  neonatal  outcomes  (PIANO)  registry,  a  prospective  multi-
centre cohort study of 1490 completed pregnancies in the USA,
showed  that  birth  parents  with  ulcerative  colitis  had  a  signifi-
cantly lower rate of remission per trimester compared with birth
parents with Crohn’s disease (p=0.002 trimester 1, p<0.0001
trimesters  2,  3).584  A  prospective  study  of  298  Israeli  women
with quiescent IBD also showed that those with ulcerative colitis
have a higher risk of active disease in pregnancy: 48.1% of those
with ulcerative colitis had a relapsing episode versus 31.8% of
those with Crohn’s disease (p=0.005). The use of biologic ther-
apies  was  protective  against  disease  relapse  (25.0%  vs  43.9%,
p=0.001).585

Foetal outcomes
A 2021 meta- analysis of 28 studies showed active IBD in preg-
nancy was significantly associated with low birth weight (LBW),
preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), spontaneous abor-
tion and stillbirths compared with women with inactive IBD.586
A  Korean  population  study  of  2058  patients  with  IBD  (589
Crohn’s  disease,  1469  ulcerative  colitis)  with  20  580  matched
controls, not included in the meta- analysis, showed similar preg-
nancy  outcomes  between  patients  with  quiescent  to  mild  IBD
and the controls.587 However, pregnant women with moderate
to severe IBD had higher rates of spontaneous abortion (14.9%
vs  11.9%,  OR=1.33,  95%  CI  1.04  to  1.68)  and  intrauterine
growth retardation (3.4% vs 1.0%, OR=3.20, 95% CI 1.75 to
5.84). In the PIANO registry, active disease was associated with
spontaneous  abortion  (HR=3.41,  95%  CI  1.51  to  7.69)  and
preterm  birth  with  increased  infant  infection  (OR=1.73,  95%
CI 1.19 to 2.51).588

Monitoring and management
Disease activity at conception strongly influences the course of IBD
during pregnancy and affects maternal and foetal outcomes. The aim
prior to conception should ideally be 3 months of corticosteroid- free
remission on stable therapy.584 Clinical assessment as well as objec-
tive  measures:  full  blood  count,  haematinics,  C- reactive  protein,
faecal calprotectin, endoscopy and imaging, should be considered.
Therapeutic drug monitoring for purine analogue metabolites and
trough  drug  and  anti- drug  antibody  TNF  levels  will  allow  drug
optimisation and aid in guiding treatment options in the case of a
disease relapse in pregnancy requiring a drug switch.

Monitoring of pregnancy in IBD
If possible, a review in each trimester, which may include non-
invasive  assessments,  should  guide  maternal  IBD  care.  Bloods
tests such as haemoglobin, albumin and CRP can be affected by
pregnancy589; however, their overall trends may be useful in the
assessment  of  the  patient.  Faecal  calprotectin  correlates  with
disease  activity  throughout  pregnancy  and  is  useful  as  a  non-
invasive marker.589 590 Patients with IBD with ileostomies have
been  shown  to  be  at  high  risk  of  developing  significant  stoma
complications in a multicentre audit.591 A total of 19/82 (23%)

Guidelines

pregnancies were affected: nine stoma prolapses (two required
surgery),  three  parastomal  hernias  (two  required  surgery)  and
seven small bowel obstructions (three required surgery). Women
with  ileostomies  should  be  educated  regarding  symptoms  to
watch out for, and monitored closely in pregnancy.

Further  investigations  should  be  guided  by  whether  active
disease develops. Routine endoscopy is not recommended, but
if  clinically  required,  it  should  be  aimed  for  beyond  the  first
trimester, procedure time minimised, no or lowest dose of seda-
tion used, and the patient positioned in the left lateral position
to avoid vena cava or aortic compression.592 Capsule endoscopy
is not currently recommended in pregnancy due to lack of data
on safety of the electromagnetic field of the capsule recorder.593
The  benefits  of  routine  imaging  are  unclear  and  therefore  not
recommended.  If  clinically  required,  MRI  without  the  use  of
gadolinium is preferred over CT to avoid radiation exposure. If
local expertise is available, gastrointestinal ultrasound provides
an  alternative  objective  assessment  of  disease  activity.  A  multi-
centre  observational  study  of  90  patients  and  127  ultrasound
scans  showed  that  adequate  colonic  and  terminal  ileal  views
were obtained up to week 20 of gestation (respectively 91% and
93%).18 Terminal ileal views deteriorated from week 20, though
colonic  views  were  deemed  adequate  up  to  week  33  as  78%
could be assessed, but this was only in nine patients.594

Conventional therapies in pregnancy
5-ASAs
5- ASA crosses the placenta, but their use during pregnancy is not
associated with adverse foetal outcomes.595 Sulfasalazine affects
folate absorption and thus, folate supplementation of 5 mg/day
is  recommended.596  5- ASAs  have  negligible  excretion  in  breast
milk and are deemed low risk for breast feeding.597

Purine analogues
Purine analogues may be used in pregnancy as a single agent, or
with anti- TNF medications. Two meta- analyses and more recent
controlled  studies  have  not  shown  adverse  foetal  outcomes,
including  congenital  abnormalities,  with  purine  analogues
compared  with  women  with  IBD  not  treated  with  purine
analogues.588  598–600  A  multicentre  retrospective  IBD  study
reviewed infant outcomes up to 5 years for 1000 children where
24%  were  exposed  to  purine  analogues  monotherapy,  and  the
drug was not associated with long- term health problems in the
children. Self- limiting intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy was
associated with purine analogues use during pregnancy.600 If the
patient is in remission on purine analogues, continuation of the
drug  is  advised.  Pregnancy  could  affect  metabolism  of  purine
analogues, so it is reasonable to check drug metabolite levels if
active disease or abnormal liver function develops in pregnancy.
Co- therapy with allopurinol may increase the risk of malforma-
tions, although this is based on only 40 pregnancy reports with
two  similar  malformations.  Ideally,  alternatives  should  be  used
(biologics or purine analogue therapy without allopurinol).601

Methotrexate
Methotrexate is teratogenic and associated with miscarriage, and
therefore not to be used during pregnancy.602 Patients of child-
bearing age should be counselled about these risks and advised
to  use  contraception  while  taking  the  drug.  If  conception  is
planned, methotrexate should be stopped ideally for 3 months,
but at least 1 month in both male and female patients. If preg-
nancy accidentally occurs on methotrexate, the drug should be
stopped, and close involvement of the obstetric team is advised.

Guidelines

Calcineurin inhibitors
Cyclosporin and tacrolimus are now rarely required for the induc-
tion  of  remission  in  corticosteroid  refractory  acute  ulcerative
colitis due to their significant side- effect profile since the advent of
biologics. The safety data of calcineurin inhibitors in pregnancy in
patients with IBD are limited but meta- analysis in transplant medi-
cine suggests they are low risk in pregnancy and are not associated
with congenital malformations or preterm labour.603 604

Corticosteroids
Studies  assessing  the  effect  of  corticosteroids  on  foetal  and
maternal outcomes are confounded by the impact of the under-
lying disease for which they are prescribed. In IBD their use is
inextricably  linked  to  the  presence  of  active  disease,  which  is
known to cause adverse outcomes in pregnancy. Maternal intra-
venous corticosteroids are detectable in the fetus at an 8–10- fold
lower  concentration;  however, even  small increases in  cortico-
steroids  can  have  a  significant  impact  on  foetal  physiology.605
The  literature  in  non- IBD  patients  suggests  an  association
between  corticosteroid  use  and  congenital  abnormalities,  such
as  cleft  lip/palate,  preterm  labour,  intrauterine  growth  retar-
dation,  small- for- gestational  age,  within  the  limitations  noted
above.606 Additional factors that are important in corticosteroid
use in pregnancy is their timing and duration and it is possible
that  other  medical  conditions,  in  comparison  with  IBD,  may
require longer- term dosing. In IBD, the PIANO registry showed
that  birth  parents  exposed  to  corticosteroids  had  an  increase
in  preterm  birth  (OR=1.79,  95%  CI  1.18  to  2.73),  low  birth
weight  (OR=1.76,  95%  CI  1.07  to  2.88)  and  neonatal  inten-
sive  care  unit  admission  (OR=1.54,  95%  CI  1.03  to  2.30).607
Corticosteroid  use  in  the  second  and/or  third  trimester  was
also  associated  with  serious  infections  at  9  and  12  months  for
the infant (4% vs 2% and 5% vs 2%, respectively, p=0.03 and
p=0.001).607 Women requiring corticosteroid use during preg-
nancy are at an increased risk of gestational diabetes (aOR=4.3,
95% CI 1.2 to 16.3) and should be closely monitored for this.608
The  overall  picture  strengthens  the  importance  of  controlling
disease  activity  pre- conception  and  during  pregnancy  with
steroid- sparing therapy if feasible. As an alternative, for milder
active  disease,  budesonide  has  a  reduced  placental  transfer
compared with prednisolone, and although data are limited, no
associated adverse outcomes have been associated with its use in
pregnancy.609  Active  disease  should  be  treated,  and  corticoste-
roids may be the most appropriate therapeutic choice. If other
therapeutic  choices  are  not  appropriate,  sufficiently  fast  acting
or when the disease is severely active, corticosteroids remain the
preferred treatment.

Biological therapies and small molecules

GPS 100

For patients with IBD receiving anti- TNF therapy, we suggest
the drug is continued throughout pregnancy to minimise the
risk of relapse and the adverse outcomes associated with
active disease, with low- certainty evidence of no increased
risk of pregnancy- related adverse outcomes (conditional
recommendation, low- certainty evidence). We suggest
continuing anti- TNF therapy throughout the whole of pregnancy
as this confers no increased risk compared with discontinuing
therapy in the third trimester.

GPS 101

Tofacitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib, ozanimod and etrasimod are
contraindicated during conception, pregnancy and lactation due
to serious malformations found in animal studies.

GPS 102

In patients with IBD in remission receiving non- anti- TNF
biologics, there are fewer data on risk of relapse in stopping
the drug versus the risk to the fetus of drug exposure. Overall
data from several studies have suggested that continuation of
vedolizumab or ustekinumab is not associated with adverse
maternal or foetal outcomes.

Active  transfer  of  IgG  from  the  maternal  to  foetal  circulation
occurs at the surface of the syncytiotrophoblast placental layer
through  the  selective  binding  of  the  Fc  gamma  portion  of  the
maternal  IgG  antibody  to  the  foetal  circulation.610  Active
transport of IgG starts at approximately week 13 of gestation,
progressing continually until delivery with a preferential trans-
port of IgG1 followed by IgG4, IgG3 and then IgG2.(630, 631).
Anti- TNF  agents,  such  as  infliximab,  adalimumab  and  golim-
umab,  are  IgG1  monoclonal  antibodies,  whereas  certolizumab
is a Fab fragment of IgG1, (without the Fc portion of IgG1) and
so there is significantly less transfer through the placenta. Vedol-
izumab,  ustekinumab  and  risankizumab  are  also  IgG1  mono-
clonal antibodies.611–613

Pregnancy  affects  the  pharmacokinetics  of  biologics:  adali-
mumab  and  ustekinumab  levels  remain  stable,  while  inflix-
imab  levels  increase  and  vedolizumab  levels  decrease.614  615
The  prospective  PIANO  study  assessed  infant  and  cord  serum
biologic  concentration  in  those  exposed  to  infliximab  (n=99),
adalimumab  (n=66),  certolizumab  pegol  (n=33),  vedolizumab
(n=22), ustekinumab (n=7), natalizumab (n=4) and golimumab
(n=4).588  Infants  had  detectable  concentrations  of  all  drugs  at
delivery,  bar  certolizumab,  as  expected.  Drug  concentration
in  the  infant’s  blood  was  higher  than  the  maternal  concentra-
tion for most biologics, apart from golimumab (same level) and
vedolizumab  (8.2  µg/mL  for  the  infant  compared  with  13  µg/
mL). 6 The use of infliximab and adalimumab during pregnancy
has been associated with foetal and cord blood levels of drug up
to fourfold higher than in maternal blood.616–618

Following delivery, infliximab levels were detectable for up to
7 months and adalimumab levels remained detectable for up to
11 weeks from birth in the infant.616 Mean time for drug clear-
ance has been reported as 7.3 months for infliximab, 4 months
for adalimumab and 3.8 months for vedolizumab (not detectable
levels at 6 months).619 620 In a small prospective study, median
time  to  ustekinumab  clearance  in  nine  infants  was  9  weeks
(range 6–19).615

Discontinuing biological therapies in the second trimester will
limit drug exposure during the time of highest transmission of
immunoglobulins  from  the  birth  parent  to  the  fetus.  Although
the timing of the last biologic appears to correlate with maternal
serum and cord blood levels, the relationship is not linear with
variability due to differences in maternal dose and interval, indi-
vidual  pharmacokinetics  and  the  immaturity  of  the  newborn
reticuloendothelial  system.  Due  to  the  increase  in  infliximab
levels  during  pregnancy,  there  may  be  a  role  for  therapeutic
drug  monitoring.  While  low  levels  of  infliximab,  adalimumab,

certolizumab,  natalizumab  and  ustekinumab  can  be  detected
in  breast  milk  from  birth  parents  receiving  these  biologics,
breastfed  infants  of  birth  parents  receiving  biologics,  immuno-
suppressants or combination therapy have similar risks of infec-
tion  and  similar  milestone  achievement  at  12  months  to  those
of non- breastfed infants or infants unexposed to these drugs.621

Cessation of anti-TNF therapy in the second trimester in quiescent
IBD
A small case–control study and a cohort study of pregnancy in
women with clinically quiescent IBD did not show a significant
increase  in  risk  of  disease  relapse  if  anti- TNF  therapy  (inflix-
imab and adalimumab) is stopped between weeks 25 and 30.622
However,  a  retrospective  study  of  8726  women  with  IBD,  of
which  1457  pregnancies  (1313  Crohn’s  disease,  144  ulcer-
ative colitis), mainly treated with infliximab (n=800) or adali-
mumab  (n=631),  found  the  opposite.  In  corticosteroid- naïve
patients,  suggesting  previously  clinically  quiescent  and  stable
disease, women who stopped anti- TNF therapy before 24 weeks
(60/131, 45.8%) had significantly more relapses than those who
continued anti- TNF therapy (63/206, 30.6%, p=0.005).623 This
difference  remained  after  adjustment  for  disease  severity,  age,
IBD  type  and  duration  and  concomitant  mercaptopurine  use
(aOR=1.98;  95%  CI  1.25  to  3.15).623  Anti- TNF  therapy  was
associated with a higher risk of overall maternal complications
(aOR=1.49; 95% CI 1.31 to 1.67) and infections (aOR=1.31;
95% CI 1.16 to 1.47), but maintaining anti- TNF after 24 weeks
did  not  increase  these  risks.623  There  is  no  benefit  in  stopping
anti- TNF  in  the  third  trimester  as  infant  infection  rates  were
similar in those whose birth parents were and were not exposed
during  the  third  trimester.  Therefore,  discontinuation  of  anti-
TNFs  during  pregnancy  in  those  with  quiescent  disease  is  not
advised due to the risk of a flare.

Continuation of anti-TNF therapy throughout pregnancy in patients
with IBD at high risk of flare
In a Danish study of 219 women with IBD, 144 (66%) experi-
enced active disease and had anti- TNF therapy continued in the
third trimester (92 treated with infliximab, 44 with adalimumab,
1  with  certolizumab  and  7  treated  with  more  than  one  drug)
with no increased risk of low birth weight or preterm birth asso-
ciated with the drug.624 Of the 144 women with disease activity,
55  were  categorised  with  mild  disease  and  89  with  moderate
to severe disease. Disease activity was associated with low birth
weight (OR=2.05) and preterm birth (OR=2.64, increasing to
an OR of 3.6 in moderate to severe disease).624 Discontinuation
of therapy may be associated with a risk of relapse during preg-
nancy and in the postpartum period.579 617

Risk to the fetus of continuing anti-TNF therapy throughout
pregnancy
A 2016 meta- analysis of six studies confirmed no increased risk
of adverse pregnancy outcomes, congenital abnormality, preterm
birth or low birth weight in those exposed to anti- TNF during
pregnancy.625 A large retrospective cohort study in 1457 preg-
nancies in women exposed to anti- TNF therapy for IBD showed
no increased infection rates in children for up to 1 year of life
(aOR=0.89,  95%  CI  0.76  to  1.05).623  In  this  study,  treatment
with  anti- TNF  was  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  overall
maternal complications (aOR=1.49, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.67) and
infections (aOR=1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.47), but ongoing use
of anti- TNF therapy beyond 24 weeks did not increase maternal
complications.623  The  primary  analysis  from  the  multicentre

Guidelines

prospective  PIANO  study  of  869  women  with  exposure  to
biologics, of which the majority were anti- TNF (421 infliximab,
279 adalimumab, 135 certolizumab pegol, 11 golimumab, and
52 exposed to more than one), showed that drug exposure did
not increase the rate of congenital malformations, spontaneous
abortions,  preterm  birth,  low  birth  weight  and  infections  over
the first year of life584 Infection rates did not differ by individual
biologic  agent  or  combined  use  of  purine  analogues.  Higher
disease activity was associated with risk of spontaneous abortion
(HR=3.41, 95% CI 1.51 to 7.69), and preterm birth increased
infant infection (OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.51).584

Despite  significant  foetal  exposure  to  anti- TNF  drugs,  there
is no evidence that continuing anti- TNF therapy through preg-
nancy  has  a  negative  impact  on  the  pregnancy  or  neonatal
outcomes, including neonatal susceptibility to infection.

Long-term infant outcomes of anti-TNF therapy during pregnancy
A  multicentre  retrospective  study  from  the  Netherlands  has
reviewed  outcomes  up  to  5  years  for  1000  children  born  to
626  birth  parents  with  IBD  (61%  Crohn’s  disease,  36%  ulcer-
ative  colitis  and  3%  IBD  unclassified).600  Twenty  percent  had
intrauterine  exposure  to  anti- TNF  and  24%  were  exposed  to
purine  analogue  monotherapy.  Neither  anti- TNF  nor  purine
analogue exposure was associated with adverse birth outcomes
or  long- term  health  outcomes  of  the  children,  including  infec-
tions requiring antibiotics, severe infections requiring admission,
adverse  reactions  to  vaccinations,  growth  failure,  autoimmune
diseases and malignancies.600

The  TEDDY  study,  a  retrospective  multicentre  European
study,  followed  up  841  children  born  to  women  with  IBD,  of
whom 46% were exposed to anti- TNF either during pregnancy
or  within  3  months  prior  to  conception  and  a  non- exposed
comparator  group.626  Median  follow- up  after  delivery  was  47
months in the exposed group and 68 months in the non- exposed
group.  The  incidence  of  severe  infections  was  similar  between
groups, and anti- TNF exposure during pregnancy was not asso-
ciated with a higher risk of severe infections (HR=1.2, 95% CI
0.8 to 1.8).626 The exposed group had more caesarean sections,
low  birth  weight  neonates  and  neonatal  intensive  care  unit
admissions.626 The PIANO study reported no impact on devel-
opmental delay up to 4 years in children exposed to biologics.600

Infant vaccinations after exposure to biologics

GPS 103
















We suggest that BCG vaccination (if indicated) should be
withheld until at least 12 months after birth for infants exposed
in utero to biological therapies. Although administering the live
rotavirus vaccine infants exposed in utero to biological therapies
is probably low risk, this should be discussed against the modest
benefits in well- resourced healthcare settings like the UK.
Non- live vaccinations should be given according to standard
vaccination schedule and all live vaccinations should be given
at, or after, 12 months. Breast feeding while on biological
therapy does not likely confer an additional risk and vaccination
decisions should be based on in utero exposure only.




Offspring  exposed  to  biologics  in  utero  are  able  to  mount
appropriate  antibody  responses  to  inactivated  vaccines  and
should  complete  the  inactivated  vaccine  programme  as  sched-
uled.52  However,  live  vaccinations  can  be  fatal  due  to  the  risk

of  immunosuppression  from  placental  transfer  of  biologic  in
pregnancy.

A 2022 systematic review assessed the safety of live vaccina-
tions  in  infants  exposed  to  anti- TNF  therapy.627  Six  of  the  10
studies included were in patients with IBD. Of the 215 infants
who received the Bacillus- Calmette- Guerin (BCG) vaccine there
was one fatally disseminated (BCG) infection following vaccina-
tion at 3 months and seven adverse reactions. Six out of seven
had  received  BCG  vaccination  at  <1  month  of  age,627  and  all
of  these  infants  had  foetal  exposure  to  infliximab.  Four  fatal
cases  of  disseminated  BCG  infection  were  reported  from  the
Medicines  and  Healthcare  products  Regulatory  Agency  from
anti- TNF foetal exposure: two from infliximab, one from adali-
mumab and one unspecified anti- TNF.627

Recent European guidelines recommend a delay of 1 year for
all live vaccinations for infants exposed to biologics in utero or
until  the  biologic  is  no  longer  detected  in  the  infant’s  serum.
Ultimately, the risk of vaccination should be balanced with the
risk of the child acquiring the disease. We recommend the BCG
vaccination  is  deferred  to  12  months  of  age.  There  remains
uncertainty about administration of rotavirus vaccine following
exposure  in  utero  to  biologics.  A  prospective  cohort  study  of
191  infants  published  in  2023628  suggested  rotavirus  vaccina-
tion was low risk, and some guidelines are now recommending
consideration of giving this vaccine. Overall, the risk and benefit
of administering the vaccine should be considered in the specific
clinical and geographic context, and the benefit in in the UK may
be very limited given the good availability of care for rotavirus
infections.

Anti-integrin (vedolizumab)
A 2021 meta- analysis assessing pregnancy outcomes in women
exposed  to  vedolizumab  included  four  studies.629  Vedoli-
zumab exposure was associated with adverse pregnancy- related
outcomes (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.13), increased preterm
births  (OR=2.16,  95%  CI  1.28  to  3.66)  and  early  loss  of

pregnancies (OR=1.79, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.01) but no difference
in number of live births or congenital malformations (OR=1.56,
95%  CI,  0.56  to  4.37).629  However,  the  authors  noted  that
disease  activity  in  those  exposed  to  vedolizumab  confounded
the  results  as  the  studies  included  patients  with  higher  disease
activity or increased number of relapses during conception and
or pregnancy in the vedolizumab exposed cohort.629–631

Numerous studies have indicated the safety of vedolizumab in
pregnancy,  including  prospective  studies  not  part  of  the  meta-
analysis:  the  multicentre  NOVA  study  (50  patients),  an  Israeli
study  (24  patients),  the  PIANO  registry  (22  patients)  and  an
American study (41 patients).619 632 In addition, the NOVA study
showed normal developmental milestones at 12 months and no
risk of infections in the infant.619

Anti-IL-12 and anti-IL-23 (ustekinumab, risankizumab)
For ustekinumab, two small retrospective studies of 29 and 57
patients,  and  a  prospective  study  of  18  patients  suggest  it  is
probably  low  risk  in  pregnant  women.631  There  were  compa-
rable  rates  of  prematurity,  live  births,  spontaneous  abortions
and congenital abnormalities and maternal complications in the
ustekinumab- exposed groups to those in the general population
and those exposed to anti- TNF therapy.631

Human  data  on  risankizumab’s  safety  in  pregnancy  are
limited.  It  is  currently  approved  for  use  in  Crohn’s  disease  in
the UK. Physicians’ communication from Abbvie shows that 60
pregnancies have occurred with risankizumab exposure, which
included  11  spontaneous  abortions,  2elective  terminations.  18
live births. To date, risankizumab has not been associated with
major congenital abnormalities.

JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upadacitinib, filgotinib)
Owing to their small size, tofacitinib and upadacitinib can cross
the placenta from the critical first trimester. Data from animal
studies on tofacitinib showed a reduction in live birth and tera-
togenicity in pregnant rabbits and rats, but at doses of 73 and 6.3

times the recommended human dose. A review of 158 pregnancy
outcomes from maternal and paternal exposure to tofacitinib in
the  intervention  studies  for  rheumatoid  arthritis,  psoriasis  and
psoriatic arthritis indicated the rates of congenital abnormalities
and live birth to be comparable to those of the general popula-
tion. Eleven cases of maternal exposure and 14 cases of paternal
exposure to tofacitinib occurred pre- conception or during preg-
nancy  in  the  ulcerative  colitis  interventional  studies.  In  this
small  cohort,  there  were  no  foetal  death  or  neonatal  deaths,
no  congenital  malformations,  two  spontaneous  abortions  and
two  medical  terminations.633  Animal  studies  showed  skeletal
and  cardiovascular  malformations  in  pregnant  rats  and  rabbits
exposed to high doses of the upadacitinib.

Owing to the limited safety data in pregnant women with IBD
and the findings from the animal studies, JAK inhibitors are not
advised when pregnancy is being planned or during pregnancy.
The manufacturer advises at least 4 weeks between the last dose
of the medication and attempting  conception. sphi

Sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitors (ozanimod and etrasomid)
Studies  in  animals  have  shown  reproductive  toxicity,  including
foetal  loss  and  anomalies,  notably,  malformations  of  blood
vessels, generalised oedema (anasarca) and malpositioned testes
and vertebrae. Sphingosine- 1- phosphate is known to be involved
in vascular formation during embryogenesis. The ozanimod clin-
ical  development  programme  has  presented  an  abstract  of  83
pregnancies with maternal and paternal exposure to ozanimod
in the first trimester in patients with multiple sclerosis and IBD
(12 patients).634 The rate of spontaneous abortion and preterm
labour was comparable to those of the general population, and
no congenital abnormalities were present.

Ozanimod is not recommended for use during pregnancy and
breast  feeding.  The  manufacturer  advises  3  months  between
the last dose and conception. No data relating to etrasimod are
currently available. Please see table 11 for a safety summary for
IBD medications used in pregnancy.

Delivery
Women with IBD are more likely to have a caesarean section, with
a meta- analysis reporting 1.5 times increased likelihood (95% CI
1.26 to 1.79; p<0.001).635 636 A caesarean section is strongly recom-
mended in those with active perianal disease or previous vaginal
fistulae. Vaginal delivery in these patients is associated with wors-
ening of perianal disease in two- thirds and increased risk of signifi-
cant perineal tears (OR=10.9; 95% C, 8.3 to 4.1; p<0.001).636 637
Women without these complications, including those with stomas,
should be reassured in proceeding with a vaginal delivery. Specifi-
cally, they are not at increased risk of perineal tearing, poor wound
healing or recurrence of perianal disease.636 637 A multicentre UK
retrospective audit of 82 pregnancies from 77 patients with stomas
(ileostomy in 72 and colostomy in 10 women) found a 73% rate of
caesarean sections (58 cases: 44 electively and 14 emergency).591
In those who had caesarean sections, there were three bladder inju-
ries, two postoperative wound infections, one postoperative collec-
tion required radiological drainage and in two patients, significant
intra- abdominal adhesions were encountered during surgery that
required adhesiolysis. Only 19 cases had an IBD reason listed for
the  need  for  caesarean  sections.  Patients  with  IBD  with  stomas
should be counselled regarding the risks of caesarean sections as
surgery can be more difficult in these patients and is likely to lead
to further adhesions.

In  those  with  an  ileal  pouch  anal  anastomosis  or  in  those
where  an  ileal  pouch  anal  anastomosis  is  being  planned,  the

Guidelines

decision  is  complex  as  even  a  minor  impairment  of  sphincter
function  could  increase  likelihood  of  faecal  incontinence  and
impaired  quality  of  life.  A  2017  meta- analysis  assessed  conti-
nence  outcomes  by  delivery  method  in  those  with  ileal  pouch
anal anastomosis in eight studies (358 patients).636 637 Uncompli-
cated vaginal delivery had no significant impact on continence
or  stool  frequency.  However,  studies  suggested  that  a  compli-
cated  vaginal  delivery  (instrumentation,  episiotomy,  significant
vaginal  tears,  baby  weight  >4.5  kg,  prolonged  second- stage
labour and an emergency caesarean section after failed vaginal
delivery) did affect rates of faecal incontinence.591 In addition,
only one study of 58 patients evaluated objective measures using
anorectal  manometry  and  endo  anal  sonography  and  found
that women who had a vaginal delivery had significantly lower
anorectal squeeze pressures and more anal sphincter defects.638
As it is difficult to predict the course of delivery, in those with
ileal pouch anal anastomosis or in those in whom an ileal pouch
anal  anastomosis  is  being  planned,  a  shared  decision- making
approach  with  patient,  obstetrician  and  colorectal  surgeons
suggested.

Post  partum,  the  risk  of  venothromboembolism  in  patients
with  active  IBD,  especially  after  a  caesarean  section  should  be
managed. If complications such as infection occur, suspension of
biological therapy should occur temporarily.

Breast feeding
Breast feeding provides the best nutrition and immune protec-
tion  for  the  infant.  Women  with  IBD  should  be  supported  in
their decision for infant feeding and reassured that the majority
of medications used in IBD are considered low risk while breast
feeding.

Animal  studies  in  both  tofacitinib  and  upadacitinib,  showed
the  drug  is  excreted  in  milk  and  that  drug  concentration  was
higher  than  in  the  birth  parent.  Breast  feeding  is  not  recom-
mended for women on JAK inhibitors or S1P modulators.

Managing pain in IBD

GPS 104

For patients with IBD and chronic pain, after ruling out
stricturing disease, abscess, or uncontrolled inflammation, it is
essential to explore other psychological factors and IBS overlap.

GPS 105

We suggest that in patients with IBD, psychological therapies
may be offered to interested patients, particularly those with
psychological symptoms, as an adjunctive therapy to improve
symptom control and quality of life.

Pain is a frequent symptom in IBD, affecting patients both during
active  disease  and  periods  of  remission.639–641  Pain  has  a  nega-
tive  impact  on  the  quality  of  life,642–644  and  is  more  prevalent
in women and those who experience stress, anxiety, or depres-
sion.645 646 In addition to these psychological factors, potential
causes of pain can encompass factors such as overlap with IBS,85
visceral hypersensitivity, possibly linked to microscopic inflam-
mation, fibromyalgia and bacterial overgrowth.647 648

Due  to  the  overlap  of  IBS  and  IBD,  often  accompanied  by
like

Guidelines

GPS 106

We recommend that for patients with coexisting IBS overlap in
IBD, the BSG IBS treatment recommendations are followed to
enhance symptom control and improve overall quality of life.

cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (CBT),  counselling,  relaxation
therapies  and  gut  hypnotherapy  may  offer  potential  benefits
and are considered safe in addressing pain even though strong
evidence  is  limited.649–652  Additionally,  IBS  diets  have  demon-
strated  benefits,  and  consulting  the  BSG- IBS  guidelines  is
advisable.653

Fatigue in IBD

GPS 107

Patients with IBD with disabling fatigue who have no
demonstrable correctable metabolic or nutritional deficiency,
and no active IBD, or patients with IBD whose fatigue persists
despite treatment for these factors, may wish to consider non-
pharmacological interventions.

An  RCT  of  psychoeducation  about  IBD  and  fatigue,  plus
solution- focused  therapy  (a  brief  form  of  psychotherapy),  for
3  months  in  patients  with  quiescent  IBD,  showed  a  reduction
in  fatigue  for  up  to  3  months  after  completion  of  therapy.
However, the effect diminished during follow- up. By 9 months
there  was  no  difference  between  the  treatment  group  and
controls.654  Another  RCT  compared  professionally  led  stress
management  with  self- directed  self- management  and  with
conventional therapy in 45 patients with Crohn’s disease. After
eight  sessions,  professionally  led  stress  management  achieved
a  greater  reduction  in  tiredness  than  other  interventions.  The
reduction  remained  beneficial  at  12  months.  However,  the
difference  was  not  statistically  significant.  Also,  tiredness  was
not the sole endpoint of the study.655

A  longitudinal  study  showed  that  regular  exercise  improved
physical  fatigue  in  IBD.656  Additionally,  an  RCT  of  phys-
ical  activity  advice  and/or  omega  3  supplementation  in  IBD,
published  in  abstract  form,  showed  that  fatigue  scores  (Func-
tional  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illness  Therapy  (FACIT)  Scale)
were better than those in the placebo group for those receiving
both interventions and also for those receiving physical activity
advice alone, but the certainty of evidence was low.657

A  prospective  randomised  study  of  electroacupuncture  in
IBD,  based  on  the  FACIT  Fatigue  Scale,  showed  a  significant
reduction  in  fatigue  in  both  treatment  and  sham  groups  in
comparison  with  controls  at  8  weeks  post- therapy,  although
no  difference  was  observed  between  the  groups.658  An  RCT
showed that high doses of oral thiamine resulted in a reduction
in fatigue at 4 weeks, but was not effective when continued for
12  weeks  and  was  also  ineffective  at  6  months.659  660  Similar
positive  findings  have  been  observed  with  vitamin  D  supple-
mentation as well.

Fatigue is a key concern for patients and significantly affects
their quality of life and well- being regardless of disease activity.
Currently,  little  evidence  exists  for  the  causes  of  fatigue  and
effective  treatment  options.  Research  on  the  pathogenesis  of
IBD- related fatigue is needed to develop welldefined treatment
algorithms and options.

Inflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing
cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare, chronic cholestatic
condition characterised by bile duct inflammation, fibrosis and
stricturing, leading to progressive liver dysfunction. Pathogenesis
is  incompletely  understood,  although  PSC  is  thought  to  occur
in those with a genetic predisposition following environmental
exposures;  dysbiosis  and  a  dysregulated  immune  response  are
strongly implicated.661 The strongest clinical risk factor for devel-
oping  PSC  is  its  close  association  with  IBD,  creating  a  distinct
PSC- IBD  subtype  with  unique  clinicopathological  features.662
Management of PSC is challenging as no proven medical therapy
exists  to  modify  the  natural  history  of  the  disease  to  prevent
progression to cirrhosis and end- stage liver disease.663

Epidemiology
Patients with PSC usually have concurrent IBD. Most population-
based studies of patients with PSC report comorbid IBD, mainly
ulcerative colitis, in greater than 50% of patients, ranging from
20%  in  Singapore  to  88%  in  Iceland.664  Conversely,  a  much
smaller proportion of patients with IBD develop PSC. The overall
pooled prevalence of PSC was 2.16% in a systematic review and
meta- analysis of 776 700 patients with IBD.665 The pooled prev-
alence  in  patients  with  ulcerative  colitis,  Crohn’s  disease,  and
IBD  unclassified  was  2.47%,  0.96%  and  5.01%,  respectively,
and was significantly higher in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn’s
disease (OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.29).665 There appears to be
a geographical variation with higher rates of PSC- IBD in Amer-
ican and European populations, and a lower association in Asian
populations.666 The age of IBD onset in patients with PSC- IBD
is contentious; some studies report a lower median age of IBD
onset compared with controls without PSC,667–669 while others
report a higher median age.662 Typically, IBD is diagnosed before
PSC, although the timing of diagnosis may be shifting in recent
years with PSC being diagnosed first.670

Phenotype of patients with PSC-IBD and disease activity
Patients with PSC- IBD have distinct clinical features in contrast
to  patients  with  IBD  without  PSC.671  When  coexistent,  either
can  run  a  subclinical  course,  particularly  in  the  early  stages  of
disease,  and  may  be  underdiagnosed.  PSC- ulcerative  colitis  is
characterised  by  a  pan- colonic  or  right  colonic  inflammation,
but the severity appears to be milder, with reduced corticosteroid
use and reduced rates of hospitalisations.669 671–675 Histologically,
colonic  inflammation  also  appears  to  be  mild  with  focal  basal
plasmacytosis  and  occasional  mild  cryptitis  rather  than  active
cryptitis with crypt abscesses, surface erosions or ulceration.674
Additionally, patients with PSC- IBD have higher rates of rectal
sparing  and  backwash  ileitis  than  non- PSC- IBD.12  662  673  676  In
PSC- Crohn’s  disease,  colonic  inflammation  is  reported  most
commonly (36.8–82.1%), followed by ileocolonic involvement
(21.8–57.9%);  isolated  small  bowel  Crohn’s  disease  in  PSC-
Crohn’s  disease  is  rare  (2–5%).671  PSC- Crohn’s  disease  also
runs  a  quiescent  disease  course,  and  stricturing  or  penetrating
phenotypes  are  uncommon.  Given  the  atypical,  milder  disease
of patients with PSC- IBD, it is important for gastroenterologists
to have a lower threshold for investigation. All patients with PSC
should initially undergo an ileocolonoscopy with biopsies, and
patients found to have colitis should then have annual surveil-
lance  colonoscopy  because  of  the  increased  risk  of  colorectal
cancer.677 Conversely, persistently abnormal liver functions in a
patient  with  IBD  requires  a  prompt  liver  aetiology  evaluation,
including a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and

referral  to  a  liver  specialist  if  no  cause  is  found  on  a  standard
screen.678

There are data to suggest an inverse relationship between PSC
disease severity and IBD activity following liver transplantation.
Patients  with  severe  PSC  requiring  transplantation  had  more
quiescent ulcerative colitis with fewer ulcerative colitis relapses,
requiring  less  immunosuppressive  drug  treatment  than  those
not  requiring  transplant.679  However,  studies  observing  IBD
disease course following liver transplantation are conflicting as
several report worsening IBD activity despite the use of immu-
nosuppressive  drugs,680  681  and  another  reported  improved
clinical  and  histo- endoscopic  IBD  scores  compared  with  the
non- transplanted cohort.673

Colorectal cancer risk
A  potential  link  between  PSC  and  increased  dysplasia  and
colorectal cancer risk in patients with IBD was first described in
the  early  1990s.682  Since  then,  numerous  studies  have  demon-
strated  that  PSC  is  a  critical  risk  factor  for  the  development
of  colorectal  cancer  in  patients  with  IBD.671  This  is  alongside
heightened risks for hepatobiliary malignancy, particularly chol-
angiocarcinoma. A meta- analysis including 13 379 patients with
IBD, of whom 1022 (7.6%) had concomitant PSC, demonstrated
a  threefold  increased  risk  of  colorectal  dysplasia  and  cancer
among  patients  with  PSC- IBD  compared  with  the  IBD- only
population  (OR=3.24;  95%  CI  2.14  to  4.90).683  In  a  recent
10- year UK- wide study of 284 560 incident IBD cases, develop-
ment of PSC in 2588 cases was associated with increased risk of
death  and  colorectal  cancer  (HR=3.20  and  2.43,  respectively;
p<0.001) and a lower median age at colorectal cancer diagnosis
(59 years vs 69 years without PSC; p<0.001). Compared with
patients with IBD alone, patients with PSC- IBD had a fourfold
higher  risk  of  colorectal  cancer  if  they  received  a  diagnosis  of
IBD at an age younger than 40 years.684 The risk of colorectal
cancer  in  PSC- Crohn’s  disease  has  been  shown  to  either  be
comparable  to  PSC- ulcerative  colitis685  or  lower.686  Data  here
are limited as PSC- Crohn’s disease is less prevalent, and cases are
complicated by the difficulties in discerning IBD subtype given
the typical PSC- IBD characteristics. Nonetheless, annual surveil-
lance colonoscopy is advocated at the point of IBD diagnosis for
patients with concurrent PSC, even after liver transplantation, to
enable early detection of dysplasia and neoplasia.

GPS 108

Commencement of colonoscopy surveillance:
 ⇒ 8 Years after IBD symptom onset.
 ⇒ From diagnosis if primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Ongoing colonoscopy surveillance for PSC- IBD.
 ⇒ Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (including post-

orthotopic liver transplant) fall into the high- risk category for
colorectal cancer and require annual surveillance.

Guidelines

1.5% to 16% compared with 3% to 11% in patients with IBD
without  PSC  after  IPAA.671  For  patients  with  IPSC  with  ulcer-
ative  colitis  undergoing  liver  transplantation,  graft  outcomes
are better for those who have an end ileostomy after colectomy
compared  with  colectomy  and  IPAA.687  Graft  loss  was  mainly
associated with hepatic artery thrombosis and biliary strictures.
The risk associated with IPAA is not dependent on the timing of
colectomy in relation to the liver transplantation. A more recent
study  showed  higher  rates  of  pouchitis,  but  not  pouch  failure,
in  patients  receiving  a  liver  transplant,  compared  with  non-
transplanted patients.688 Patients with PSC may be offered IPAA
as long as they understand the potential implications.

GPS 109

Patients undergoing colectomy who have coexistent ulcerative
colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be advised that
there is an increased risk of pouchitis, to inform decision- making
regarding ileoanal pouch formation or permanent ileostomy.

Patient education
There  is  evidence  that  patient  educational  interventions  can
have beneficial effects on patients’ disease control and quality
of  life  in  IBD.  Educational  interventions  can  take  different
forms  of  delivery  including  face- to- face,  virtual  sessions  or
workshops,  printed  or  online  educational  material,  online
educational  guides  or  mobile  smartphone  applications.  It
is  envisaged  that  education  can  enhance  patient  knowledge
of  IBD  in  order  to  empower  them  to  manage  their  condi-
tion;  however,  the  question  on  how  this  might  affect  disease
outcomes  is  complex  and  poorly  understood.  A  patient
summary is given in Appendix 5.

Educational  interventions  can  be  divided  into  those  that

ensure patients have the information and support:
1.  To recognise a relapse of their condition.
2.  To improve medication adherence and recognise adverse side

effects.

3.  To  educate  themselves  on  self- management  and  quality  of

life.

4.  To  educate  themselves  on  environmental  factors,  diet  and

exercise.

5.  To use psychology tools to improve their quality of life.

Several  studies  in  recent  years  have  looked  at  a  variety  of
educational  interventions  and  their  potential  impact  on  IBD
outcomes.

Patients  with  IBD  were  randomised  to  an  educational
programme versus control in an RCT carried out by the GETAID
group.689  The  primary  endpoint  of  an  increase  in  a  specific
psycho- pedagogic score of >20% was met in 46% vs 24% of the
educated  and  control  groups,  respectively  (p=0.0003).  These
findings  support  the  set- up  of  educational  programmes  in  the
management of IBD.

Surgery in PSC
For patients with IBD- PSC who undergo proctocolectomy and
ileal  pouch  anal  anastomosis  (IPAA),  there  is  a  higher  rate  of
complications and pouch failure. The most common complica-
tion is pouchitis, and in a systematic review of 11 406 patients
with  PSC- IBD,  pouchitis  affected  14%  to  90%  of  patients
compared with 12% to 53% in ulcerative colitis without PSC.671
Pouch failure was similar in patients with PSC- IBD and seen in

GPS 110

We recommend that patient education interventions may be
offered to patients with IBD as an adjuvant to routine clinical
practice, with the aim of improving patient engagement,
medication adherence and reducing hospital attendances.

Guidelines

Berding et al randomised patients into an intervention group
(two- part  IBD  education  programme)  versus  control.690  They
concluded that an IBD education programme can have a positive
impact on psychological distress and self- management skills, but
no effect was observed on disease activity, health- related quality
of life (QoL) or symptoms of anxiety and depression. Another
recent RCT assessed the impact of patient- centred information
on level of knowledge and QoL of patients with newly diagnosed
IBD.691 The authors concluded from their findings that an educa-
tional intervention shortly after diagnosis can improve patients’
knowledge  and  QoL  regardless  of  disease  activity.  Looking  at
forms  of  education  delivery,  a  smaller  RCT  assessed  the  effect
of web- based education versus standard education via books.692
Symptom  severity,  disease  activity  and  QoL  were  found  to  be
improved in both groups, suggesting that patient education can
improve outcomes, but that the content of patient education is
more important than the form of delivery. The effect of intensi-
fied IBD nurse care was assessed by Barkan et al.693 Patients were
randomised to standard or intensified nurse care and outcomes
of  patients’  uncertainty  scores  and  PROMs  were  evaluated  at
recruitment and after therapy initiation. At week 14, uncertainty
scores  were  found  to  significantly  differ  between  both  groups,
with  an  improvement  seen  in  the  IBD  nurse  care  group.  They
also  found  that  intensified  IBD  nurse  care  was  associated  with
improvement  in  certain  PROMs,  such  as  defaecation  manage-
ment, well- being and sexual dysfunction.

With more of a focus on mindfulness, González- Moret et al
carried  out  a  RCT  looking  at  the  effect  of  mindfulness- based
therapy  in  IBD  versus  standard  care.694  Significant  decreases
were  observed  in  objective  biomarkers  of  inflammation  (CRP
and faecal calprotectin) in the mindfulness group compared with
standard care. Similarly, another study explored the benefits of
a  lifestyle  modification  programme  versus  control  in  patients
with  ulcerative  colitis  in  clinical  remission  with  impaired
QoL.695  Improvements  in  QoL  were  observed  in  both  groups.
In contrast to González- Moret et al, there was no effect seen on
clinical  disease  activity.  A  systematic  review  and  meta- analysis
of  seven  RCTs  (n=655)  looked  specifically  at  the  effects  of
cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (CBT).696  They  concluded  that
CBT  appeared  to  support  higher  QoL  in  patients  with  IBD
than in those receiving standard treatment, but had no effect on
disease activity, anxiety or perceived stress in patients with IBD,
suggesting that CBT could be an acceptable adjunctive therapy,
but its effect was limited.

Several  recent  studies  have  focused  specifically  on  medica-
tion  adherence  interventions.  Three  recent  studies  looked  at
the impact of an educational intervention (namely, an education
programme,697  novel  patient  education  tool,698  and  once  daily
versus divided dosing regimen699). All the studies found no signif-
icant improvement in adherence rates between groups.697–699 A
systematic review of 17 studies (n=1144) looked at medication
adherence  interventions.700  The  interventions  included  were
online educational resources or courses, telemedicine, automatic
reminders, text messages, electronic needle containers. Although
each  study  demonstrated  some  level  of  success  in  improving
medication adherence in patients with IBD, overall, the studies
were of poor quality and poor statistical analysis.

In  another  systematic  review  from  2022  (n=2637),  Nguyen
et  al  looked  at  mixed  online  or  mobile  phone  educational
resources or courses and their impact on disease activity moni-
toring, treatment adherence, quality of life and healthcare util-
isation.701  Digital  interventions  were  of  average  usefulness  in
all  the  outcome  areas  measured,  with  medication  adherence

being the most successful, but this outcome was looked at in the
fewest studies. The review summarised the possibility of digital
interventions  to  improve  outcomes  but  did  not  demonstrate  a
majority of studies enabling this.

The  most  comprehensive  overview  on  this  topic  available
to  date  is  a  Cochrane  systematic  review  and  meta- analysis
performed by Gordon et al.702 A total of 2708 patients, from 14
RCTs, were included. The interventions were educational semi-
nars, educational text messages, e- learning modules, group and
solo  education  programmes,  guidebooks,  educational  sessions
via  IBD  pocket  guides,  interactive  educational  videos.  Four
studies  looked  at  the  outcome  of  disease  activity,  5  studies  at
relapses, 10 studies at quality of life, 4 studies at healthcare util-
isation, 5 studies at medication adherence and seven studies at
patient knowledge. Overall, the studies were limited, and poor
reporting of outcome measures severely limited the scope of the
meta- analysis and affected the certainty of evidence. Gordon et
al  concluded  that  there  is  evidence  that  education  is  probably
of no benefit to disease activity or quality of life in comparison
with  standard  care  and  may  be  of  no  benefit  to  occurrence  of
relapse in comparison with standard care. However, the authors
stressed that the utility of these findings is questionable. Based
on the outcomes of these analyses, and the likely mechanism of
action of education for patients with IBD as well as the intended
goals of the educational interventions and their impact on stake-
holders,  they  suggested  that  further  research  to  investigate  the
impact  of  education  on  primary  outcomes  of  disease  activity,
disease state and quality of life is probably not indicated.

Suggested future key research areas are to ensure educational
interventions  are  reported  in  a  manner  that  supports  transpar-
ency,  dissemination  and  replication,  and  to  focus  on  outcomes
that educational interventions can be directly targeted to address.
Medication adherence and healthcare access are recommended
as good targets for future work. Furthermore, specific subsets of
patients such as those with newly diagnosed IBD or socially and
financially  disadvantaged  patients  who  may  be  in  greater  need
of  educational  support  should  also  be  encouraged.  It  should
be  emphasised  that  educational  programmes  should  be  patient
centred—ultimately,  they  need  to  provide  information  and
provide  support  that  patients  need  in  order  to  empower  them
to manage their condition. Education, information and support
resources  are  available  to  patients  from  charities  including
Crohn’s and Colitis UK (https:// crohnsandcolitis. org. uk/).

Transition from paediatric to adult services
The BSG IBD GDG consider transition from paediatric to adult
care and the support of young people undergoing this process as
a fundamental component of high- quality care. A specific guide-
line  was  published  on  this  topic  by  BSG  in  2017  and  is  now
undergoing review. It is beyond the scope of this document to
revisit  this  whole  area;  however,  we  endorse  the  parallel  BSG
guidelines on this topic.703 In brief, 16 recommendations were
made across four headings in the last guideline—namely, patient
populations involved in transition; risks of failing transition or
poor  transition;  models  of  transition;  patient  and  carer/parent
perspective.  Ultimately,  the  guideline  promoted  structured
transition  with  overlap  between  paediatric  and  adult  gastroen-
terology and proposed a pathway to support this.703. A topical
review  on  transition  was  also  published  by  European  Crohn’s
and  Colitis  Organisation  (ECCO)  in  2017  with  14  practice
points highlighted.704 The ECCO document was perhaps a little
less process- orientated and a little more patient- orientated and

s82

so the two are complementary. Irrespective, there was agreement
on the need for a structured approach to transition.

Subsequent to the last BSG transition guidelines, a systematic
review  has  been  published  on  the  topic  within  IBD,  encom-
passing 23 studies, only 10 of which were published as full- text
articles. The overall quality of evidence was considered very low
by GRADE. Eleven of the studies suggested improved outcomes
with structured transition.705

Smoking and IBD

GPS 111

All patients with IBD should be advised to stop smoking, and
national guidance on smoking cessation should be followed.
Patients with IBD should be warned of the risks of continued
smoking.

Smoking is a proven and highly significant cause of illness and
death  in  the  UK,  irrespective  of  any  consideration  of  IBD.  In
particular, smoking increases the risk of multiple cancers as well
as  serious  cardiovascular  and  pulmonary  sequalae.  All  patients
with IBD should be asked about their smoking history, including
vaping/e- cigarette  use,  specifically  asking  about  active,  passive
or social smoking. Those exposed to smoking should be advised
of the harm to their health and, if applicable, offered smoking
cessation referral. Without support there is a less than 10% like-
lihood  of  long- term  abstinence,  but  this  can  be  reversed  with
interventions.706  707  Interventions  include  behavioural  therapy
alongside pharmacological interventions such as nicotine replace-
ment and other prescription medications such as bupropion and
varenicline. The approach to smoking cessation in patients with
IBD does not differ from the approach in other patient groups,
therefore we recommend that IBD teams should follow existing
national guidance as the best approach to this intervention.

The  arrival  and  growth  of  e- cigarette  use  since  the  last  BSG
IBD Guidelines has generated an area where advice is warranted
but evidence is lacking, hence the need for caution and a need to
review this topic area as our understanding develops. One preva-
lent English study in 2019 described at least 3% uptake of e- cig-
arettes in an outpatient IBD population.708 A single retrospective
case–control study from the USA suggested e- cigarette use was not
associated with indices of severe IBD disease, including surgery or
escalation  to/switching  of  biologics.709  At  present,  the  evidence
suggests  that  nicotine- containing  e- cigarettes  are  more  effective
at promoting abstinence from smoking than other conventional
approaches  and  the  risk  of  serious  adverse  events  appears  low,
although with limited long- term data.710 It is not our role as IBD
clinicians  to  review  the  evidence  of  risk/benefit  of  e- cigarettes,
outwit the context of our disease expertise, however, colleagues
in the British Thoracic Society have recently completed an excel-
lent  document  on  smoking  cessation  which  includes  discussion
of e- cigarettes. We would like to endorse this document as useful

GPS 112

Preoperative counselling advising smoking cessation is
recommended. Before elective Crohn’s disease surgery, patients
should be informed of the increased risks of surgery including
higher rates of stoma formation and the increased risk of disease
recurrence in smokers.

Guidelines

reading for the BSG membership, but would reiterate four partic-
ular points here: people who do not smoke should not vape; when
people use vapes to stop smoking, they should switch completely
to  vaping  from  smoking;  vaping  is  not  risk- free;  vaping  should
not be used by an individual under 18 years of age.

Smoking with Crohn’s disease
Smoking is more common in patients with Crohn’s disease than
in the general population and more likely in those diagnosed at
an older age.711 712 A study in the USA showed that 47% of those
diagnosed with Crohn’s disease over the age of 40 were active
smokers, compared with 27% in the background population.712
Smoking is associated with a worse IBD disease course than in
never smokers,711 713 more adverse effects in women who smoke
than  men714  and  a  higher  risk  of  surgery  and  worse  outcomes
post- surgery.  A  meta- analysis  showed  a  2.5  times  increased
risk  of  repeat  surgery  and  2  times  risk  of  clinical  recurrence
in  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease.715  Smoking  also  worsens  all
outcomes in colorectal surgery, regardless of the indication for
this surgery.716 717 Passive or occasional light smoking (less than
10 cigarettes per day) does not reduce the damaging effects of
smoking  in  Crohn’s  disease,  therefore  it  is  important  that  we
advocate  complete  cessation.718  There  are  benefits  of  stopping
smoking  at  any  stage  of  a  patient’s  disease  journey.719  Despite
poor  awareness  in  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  of  the  bene-
fits  of  stopping,720  721  and  the  knowledge  that  smoking  cessa-
tion services can be underused,722 setting up a smoking cessation
service can be cost- effective when disease management costs are
considered.723 In the TABACROHN study, a smoking cessation
programme supported 31% of patients with Crohn’s disease to
stop  smoking  completely,  with  23%  (74%  of  those  stopping)
remaining abstinent 18 months later.724

Smoking with ulcerative colitis
The  interplay  of  smoking  and  ulcerative  colitis  remains  a  clin-
ical challenge, which may increase in complexity with the advent
of e- cigarettes. Nonetheless, there is solid evidence on which to
base  specific  guidance,  which  we  will  summarise  here.  Ulcer-
ative colitis is more likely to develop in those who have recently
stopped  smoking  and  is  more  common  in  non- smokers.713  725
In  those  who  previously  smoked,  the  highest  risk  period  for
ulcerative colitis onset is in the first 2–5 years after stopping.726
Ex- smokers  present  with  ulcerative  colitis  later  in  life  than
never- smokers.727 728 patients with ulcerative colitis who smoke
have better outcomes overall, such as reduced colectomy rates,
less primary sclerosing cholangitis and less backwash ileitis, than
never smokers.718 Higher overall smoking is associated with less
extensive disease and a reduced need for therapy. Patients with
ulcerative  colitis  who  stop  smoking  have  a  significantly  worse
disease course than those who continue, with increased steroid
and immunomodulator use and increased hospitalisation rates.718
Ex- smokers  with  refractory  ulcerative  colitis  who  resumed
smoking  had  high  rates  of  steroid- free  remission.729  However,
smoking does not reduce the risk of pouchitis after ileal pouch-
anal  anastomosis  for  ulcerative  colitis,  neither  smoking  at  the
time of operation nor later.730 In spite of the perceived benefits
of smoking in ulcerative colitis, the risk versus benefit remains
heavily  in  favour  of  cessation  because  of  the  well- recognised
cardiovascular, respiratory and carcinogenesis risks of smoking.
Every effort should therefore be made to encourage patients to
stop, even if this includes an escalation of IBD pharmacotherapy
or consideration of surgery. In no circumstance should smoking
be  advocated  on  medical  grounds  as  a  therapeutic  option  in

ulcerative colitis. a proactive plan should therefore be offered to
mitigate the risk of worsening disease, including an increase in
medical treatment, at the time of smoking cessation.

Digital health technology

GPS 113

We recommend that the use of digital health technology should
be offered to patients with IBD as an adjunct to face- to- face
interactions, particularly with regard to improving patient
engagement and medication adherence and reducing hospital
attendances. Care must be taken not to disadvantage those
affected by digital poverty and alternative inclusive parallel
strategies must be developed.

Over  the  past  decade,  technology  has  advanced  at  an  increas-
ingly rapid pace, offering powerful opportunities to collect and
analyse large datasets. Telemedicine, through digital health tech-
nology, includes the use of mobile phones, tablets, web platforms
and  wearables  to  improve  health  outcomes.  Its  revolutionary
impact  on  healthcare  contributes  towards  personalised  health.
Despite the major impact of new technology on all medical fields,
including IBD, the scientific evidence currently available is still
preliminary and relies on moderate- or low- quality studies.

Sparse  clinical  trials  have  provided  inconsistent  evidence
regarding the impact of new tools on clinical disease outcomes.
Nevertheless,  the  current  evidence  supports  the  use  of  digital
technology in view of its safety and its complementary benefit
to  traditional  management.  Five  areas  of  clinical  care  that  can
benefit  from  digital  health  technology  are  education  (disease
knowledge), monitoring, treatment, follow- up and patient satis-
faction.694 731–740

A  recent  systematic  review  and  meta- analysis  published  by
Gordon  et  al741  on  remote  telehealth  care  for  patients  with
IBD  included  19  RCTs  with  a  total  of  3489  participants.  The
interventions  were  either  web- based  or  telephone-based.  The
evidence suggested that, for disease activity, flare- ups, relapses,
and  quality  of  life,  web- based  disease  monitoring  is  probably
no different from standard of care in adults. One study showed
that  medication  adherence  probably  increases  with  web- based
monitoring compared with usual care (MD 0.24 points, 95% CI
0.01  to  0.47,  moderate  certainty).  The  review  could  not  draw
conclusions  on  the  effects  of  telephone- based  disease  moni-
toring,  or  web- based  disease  monitoring  compared  with  usual
care  on  healthcare  access,  participant  engagement,  attendance
rate, interactions with healthcare professionals, or cost- or time-
effectiveness (very low evidence).741

Another recent systematic review and meta- analysis by Kuria-
kose  Kuzhiyanjal,  et  al742  also  showed  no  benefits  of  digital
technology  on  disease  activity,  number  of  relapses  or  clinical
remission, with moderate certainty of evidence in adults and low
certainty in children. However, it identified benefits of remote
tools  for  quality  of  life,  number  of  outpatient  visits  and  emer-
gency admissions.742

An umbrella review of eight systematic reviews, including four
meta- analyses,  reported  patient  benefits  limited  to  satisfaction,
quality of life, quality of care, medication adherence and reduced
hospital attendances but found no impact on disease activity.743

In summary, systematic reviews of the RCTs on digital health
technology  in  IBD  performed  so  far,  highlight  mixed  results
from  highly  heterogeneous  studies.  Most  found  no  statistical

difference between controls and intervention groups in achieving
and  maintaining  remission  or  preventing  flare- ups.  A  common
weakness  of  the  studies  is  the  insufficient  description  of  the
nature,  frequency  and  duration  of  the  digital  interventions.743
Nevertheless, the data available suggest that digital health tech-
nology contributes to higher medication adherence and reduced
hospital  assessments  compared  with  usual  care.  While  the
reviews to date support the potential of digital interventions to
improve outcomes, they do not demonstrate this in the majority
of studies. Telemedicine should be regarded as a promising mode
of healthcare delivery and as an important adjuvant to routine
clinical practice.

Digital health technology is also likely to offer a virtual moni-
toring  context  that  will  support  point- of- care  testing  such  as
home faecal calprotectin. Further research is needed to identify
which  patients  with  IBD  would  most  benefit  from  telemedi-
cine, allowing these approaches to be tailored to specific patient
populations.  In  addition,  assessing  and  quantifying  the  impact
of  remote  care,  telemedicine  and  digital  health  technology  on
sustainability  and  carbon  footprint  deserves  prioritisation  in
the current era of global warming, pollution and other environ-
mental threats.744

Further research is required to assist planning and providing
appropriate  services  that  best  meet  patient  needs  and  prefer-
ences.  Future  RCTs  should  include  a  follow- up  duration  of  at
least  2  years  and  detailed  intervention  descriptions  to  ensure
reproducibility. These trials should evaluate the benefits of digital
health  technology  on  both  IBD- related  and  patient- reported
outcomes. The research needs for adolescents and young adults
with IBD were explored in a research priority setting partnership
supported by BSG and BSPGHAN and will guide future funding
directions in this population.745

Inflammatory bowel disease and spondyloarthropathies

GPS 114

 ⇒ In people simultaneously diagnosed with IBD and SpA

(including axial/peripheral SpA and psoriatic arthritis (PsA)),
monoclonal TNFα inhibitors (or their biosimilars) are the
recommended choice of treatment, in view of their efficacy
in IBD.

 ⇒ Tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor) is effective in ulcerative colitis and
licensed for ulcerative colitis and PsA in the UK. However,
tofacitinib is not licensed for Crohn’s disease in the UK.
 ⇒ Upadacitinib is licensed in the UK for Crohn’s disease,

ulcerative colitis, PsA and axial SpA (including ankylosing
spondylitis).

 ⇒ Ustekinumab is licensed in the UK for Crohn’s disease,

ulcerative colitis, PsA and psoriasis (PsO), but not for axial
SpA (including ankylosing spondylitis).

 ⇒ Risankizumab is licensed in the UK for Crohn’s disease,

PsA and PsO, but not for axial SpA (including ankylosing
spondylitis).

 ⇒ Etanercept, abatacept, secukinumab, ixekizumab and

brodalumab should be avoided owing to the lack of efficacy
and to the risk of causing exacerbation of IBDs.

The  effectiveness  of  IBD  treatments  on  SpA  (including  axial/
peripheral  spondyloarthritis  and  PsA)  needs  to  be  broken
down  according  to  the  different  domains  that  characterise
SpA—namely:

Guidelines

 ► Peripheral arthritis; enthesitis/dactylitis.
 ► Axial  disease  (no  current  evidence  about  the  efficacy  of

the IL- 23 pathway blockade—either p40 or p19 blockersused in
the treatment of PsA.752

IL- 23 pathway inhibition for treating this domain).

For clinicians taking care of patients with IBD and a related
concomitant SpA, we would recommend signposting to the BSR
recommendations  for  PsA  or  the  ASAS- EULAR  recommenda-
tions for axial SpA.746 747 No phase II or III clinical trial so far has
formally assessed the efficacy of therapies for IBD in people who
have concomitant SpA (regardless of specific domain manifesta-
tions). No head- to- head comparisons of the drugs listed above
suggest  that  any  of  these  treatments  are  superior  to  another
when treating SpA (including axial/peripheral SpA and PsA). A
multidisciplinary  approach  to  management,  with  elements  of
cooperation across different specialties (gastroenterology, rheu-
matology,  dermatology,  ophthalmology  and  others)  should  be
adopted whenever possible. There is no evidence of the efficacy
of vedolizumab in SpA. Some studies point to increased risk of
arthritis  (flare/de  novo  development)  in  patients  treated  with
vedolizumab for IBD.748–750 However, the effect of withdrawal
of  prior  treatment  with  steroids  or  TNFα  inhibitors  should  be
factored in when appraising this evidence.751

Peripheral arthritis
Data  favour  the  use  of  a  number  of  different  treatments  over
placebo for peripheral arthritis. These are methotrexate, sulfas-
alazine, TNFα- nhibitors, IL- 12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab, IL- 23
inhibitors  and  JAK  inhibitors.  No  head- to- head  data  suggest
that any of the target treatments are superior to another when
treating  peripheral  arthritis.  Although  UK  regulations  allow
the use of IL- 17A and IL- 17A/F inhibitors for treatment of PsO
and PsA, we would recommend clinicians to be cautious when
considering the use of these drugs in patients who have concom-
itant IBD, even if inactive.752–756 Abatacept is licensed for use in
PsA, although it is not effective in the treatment of IBD or PsO.757

Enthesitis/dactylitis
As above, data favour the use of a number of different treatments
over  placebo  for  this  domain.  These  are  methotrexate  (condi-
tional  recommendation,  limited  evidence),  TNFα  inhibitors,
the  IL- 12/23  inhibitor  ustekinumab,  IL- 23  inhibitors  and  JAK
inhibitors. Again, no head- to- head data suggest that any of these
treatments are superior to another.

Axial disease
In axial SpA or patients with PsA and related axial involvement,
fewer  efficacious  medications  are  available.  Evidence- based
effective treatments in axial disease include TNFα inhibitors, JAK
inhibitors and IL- 17 inhibitors—though the last of these requires
caution when considered for patients with IBD. In patients with
IBD and concomitant psoriatic axial disease, no robust evidence
is  yet  available  to  suggest  that  IL- 12/23  and  IL- 23  inhibitors
might have efficacy in the axial setting. However, there are no
trials  directly  addressing  axial  PsA  in  IBD,  and  expert  recom-
mendations  in  rheumatology  shun  the  use  of  IL- 23  pathway
blockers in this PsA axial setting.

The lack of medical literature on this specific, narrow matter
brings to the attention of the gastroenterology community one
scientific unmet need. Yet, it is important to highlight the diffi-
culties expected in setting up—and running—clinical trials aimed
at  ascertaining  the  simultaneous  effect  of  any  intervention  on
double outcome measures (that is, pertaining to SpA alongside
to  IBD).  So  far,  no  robust  evidence  suggests  response  of  axial
manifestations of SpA (including ankylosing spondylitis (AS)) to

Some non- biologic agents are useful for the treatment of SpA
and unlikely to induce IBD relapses at the same time. Sulphas-
alazine—a  drug  licensed  in  the  UK  for  the  treatment  of  both
ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease has some efficacy on PsA,
though not on PsO or axial manifestations of SpA. Methotrexate
is  useful  in  peripheral  manifestations  of  PsA,  skin  PsO  and  all
IBD  (though  predominantly  in  Crohn’s  disease),  but  it  is  not
effective on axial manifestations of SpA.

The  JAK  inhibitors  can  be  beneficial  to  both  SpA  and  IBD.
Tofacitinib’s UK licence allows use in PsA and ulcerative colitis,
though not in Crohn’s disease. Upadacitinib has efficacy, and a
licence, for the treatment of AS, PsA, Crohn’s disease and ulcer-
ative colitis and is effective in PsO. To the best of our knowledge,
literature  has  not  reported  so  far  on  paradoxical  flares  of  IBD
relapses or uveitis linked to small molecules.

The  PDE4  blocker  apremilast,  licensed  for  PsA  and  PsO,  is
not  associated  with  the  induction  of  IBD  relapses.  Although
not effective in axial SpA and not commonly used in IBD, some
evidence  points  to  its  beneficial  effect  on  ulcerative  colitis.758
With regard to the biologic agent, all TNFα inhibitors belonging
to  the  monoclonal  antibodies  class—and  certolizumab—have
demonstrated  effect  on  IBDs,  PsA,  PsO  and  axial  manifesta-
tions  of  SpA.  A  few  caveats  stand  when  biologic  agents  come
to  consideration,  though.  Etanercept  was  associated  with  IBD
relapses when used for SpA.759 The IL- 23 blocker ustekinumab,
while  effective  on  IBDs,  PsO  and  peripheral  manifestations  of
SpA  and  PsA,  has  not  so  far  shown  beneficial  effects  on  axial
manifestations of SpA. The same broadly applies to IL- 23 inhibi-
tors. The use of IL- 17 blockers requires attention, owing to their
association with gastrointestinal effects, and gastroenterologists
should avoid them in active IBD.753 760

TNFα inhibitors have the ability to induce a form of paradox-
ical psoriasis in 2–5% of treated cases, possibly via a mechanism
of selective overexpression of type I interferons driven by dermal
accumulation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. According to recent
estimates, incidence of PsO or psoriasiform lesions in patients with
IBD treated with TNFα inhibitors is 6% (95% CI 5.0% to 7.0%),761
pointing to the possibility that this paradoxical reaction may occur
slightly more frequently in IBD. The same study found that factors
associated  with  paradoxical  PsO  development  were:  smoking
(OR=1.97, 1.56 to 2.48); Crohn’s disease affecting the ileo- colonic
tract (OR=1.48, 1.03 to 2.13); female gender (OR=1.46, 1.23 to
1.73);  younger  age  at  initiation  of  TNFα  inhibitors  (OR=1.03,
1.00 to1.05).761 Occasional reports of de novo articular inflamma-
tory manifestations—for example, PsA occurring in patients with
IBD receiving TNFα inhibitors, have emerged in the medical liter-
ature. However, such events appear to be less frequent than those
affecting  the  skin.762  Multiple  studies  linked  vedolizumab  to  the
emergence of SpA- related pathology following successful therapy
for IBD. However, these events are uncommon.748 750 751

Ocular  complications  in  IBD  are  infrequent  and  occur  in
<10%  of  cases.27  The  use  of  systemic  steroids  may  cause  side
effects, including cataract after prolonged use and raised intra-
ocular  pressure  leading  to  secondary  open- angle  glaucoma.
Corticosteroid- induced  glaucoma,  however,  is  more  common
with the use of topical ocular formulations, rather than systemic
formulations of steroids. Total parenteral nutrition may be asso-
ciated with retinal maculopathy. The same authors highlighted
that  the  use  of  anti- cholinergic  agents  can  cause  disturbances
of  accommodation  and  pupillary  dilatation.  The  use  of  some
immunosuppressive  therapy—namely,  cyclosporin,  is  associ-
ated  with  optic  neuropathy,  opthalmoplegia  and  nystagmus.763

Methotrexate  is  an  uncommon  cause  of  periorbital  oedema,
ocular pain, blurred vision, photophobia, conjunctivitis, bleph-
aritis,  decreased  reflex  tear  secretion  and  non- arteritic  isch-
aemic  optic  neuropathy.764  Low- quality  evidence  points  to  the
possibility of occurrence of some forms of ocular inflammation
(inclusive of optic neuritis and uveitis) following treatment with
TNFα  inhibitors.765  Gastroenterologists  should  be  aware  of
such potential treatment- related side effects. Limited evidence is
available about ocular side effects with the newer biologics. One
case report of ustekinumab- induced sclerouveitis was published
in 2022,766 suggesting uncommon occurrence.
