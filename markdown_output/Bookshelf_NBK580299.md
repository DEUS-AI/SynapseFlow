Preface

As a practicing gastroenterologist, I treated patients who had Crohn’s
disease and ulcerative colitis. Both are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)
and  among  the  most  common  autoimmune  diseases.  Over  the  last  two
decades, we have made progress in diagnosing IBD, but we have not yet
identified biomarkers that enable us to screen for it. We have made revo-
lutionary advances in targeting pharmaceutical therapies to manage IBD,
but these options are still limited, many patients have refractory disease,
and the therapies themselves may have significant side effects. There is
currently no cure for IBD, so for much of their lives, patients may be at
risk for developing additional autoimmune diseases as well as complica-
tions such as cancer, infections, and maternal/fetal complications. During
the course of this study, I was also reminded that we do not have reliable
U.S. incidence and prevalence data for IBD.

A  goal  of  autoimmune  disease  research  is  to  empower  physicians
to  more  accurately  diagnose,  treat,  minimize,  and  ideally,  cure  disease.
There  is  a  critical  research  gap  in  personalized  medicine,  for  example,
the  ability  to  measure  a  combination  of  individual  genetics,  serologies,
phenotypes, and biological mechanisms that predict response to a specific
therapy. Side effects and eventual failures, over time, of current medica-
tions dictate a need for continuing research into disease pathogenesis and
candidate therapeutics.

Congressional legislation has often assisted in focusing National Insti-
tutes of Health (NIH) efforts to meet urgent demands related to the health



PREFACE

and welfare of U.S. citizens. In 2019 Congress called for NIH to contract
with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to
identify and review NIH’s research efforts in the broad area of autoim-
mune diseases with a particular emphasis on the risk factors, diagnostic
tools,  barriers  to  diagnosis,  treatments,  and  prospects  for  cure.  Given
the  complexity  of  autoimmune  diseases  and  the  fact  that  they  encom-
pass many conditions, the committee’s expertise included clinicians and
researchers  in  numerous  specialties  that  focus  on  autoimmune  diseases
as  well  as  epidemiologists,  health  disparities  researchers,  and  persons
familiar with NIH’s research administration processes.

NIH has conducted research that has contributed significantly to the
advances in care of autoimmune disease, and it is important to continue
to translate research knowledge into more precise diagnostic criteria and
clinical interventions to achieve the best outcomes and benefit the lives
of our patients. Progress in medical research requires visionary strategic
thinking, the ability to meet constant challenges in disease prevention and
therapeutics, new findings in genetics, coordination, and interdisciplinary
guidance.

The  recommendations  of  the  committee  in  Chapter  7  are  preceded
by a thoughtful analysis of Institute and Center (IC) autoimmune disease
research activity along with the committee findings and conclusions. The
number  and  complexity  of  these  diseases  requires  a  concerted  strategic
effort  that  leverages  the  many  research  activities  that  occur  across  ICs.
The committee identifies opportunities and options for enhancing auto-
immune disease research at NIH. The committee’s recommendations pro-
vide a basis for developing a strategy with metrics that yield data that can
be reviewed periodically. It is our hope that a subsequent review would
show advancement in autoimmune disease research and improvements
in outcomes.

On behalf of the committee, I would like express our thanks for the
responsiveness of NIH’s ICs and Offices in aiding the committee to gather
information. A special thanks to Lisa Begg (Office of the Director/Office
of  Research  on  Women’s  Health),  Susan  Cooper  (National  Institute  of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID]), and Ellen Goldmuntz (NIAID)
for their guidance and support.

I would also like to thank the committee members for their tremen-
dous  commitment  and  hard  work,  all  the  more  meaningful  in  view  of
increased responsibilities both in their practices and their lives as a result
of the pandemic, and the need to meet and work together virtually.

On behalf of the committee, I would like to express our thanks and
appreciation to the National Academies leadership and staff: Rose Marie

Summary1

Autoimmune diseases occur when the body’s immune system, which
normally  defends  the  body  against  disease  and  infection,  malfunctions
and mistakenly attacks healthy cells, tissues, and organs. Common auto-
immune  diseases  include  celiac  disease,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  psoriasis,
multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and type 1 diabetes.
Autoimmune diseases are chronic and lifelong and can cause significant
physical and psychosocial impairment, impeding activities of daily living,
productivity, and quality of life. They can occur at any age, and many, but
not all, predominantly affect women, with female-to-male ratios reaching
6:1  or  higher  for  some  diseases. Autoimmune  diseases  as  a  group  rank
among  the  10  leading  causes  of  death  for  females.  Individuals  with  an
autoimmune  disease  commonly  develop  more  than  one  autoimmune
disease, and they can be at increased risk of developing cancer and cardio-
vascular disease as well as a wide variety of other illnesses and complica-
tions. There are no known cures for autoimmune diseases.

There  is  no  consensus  on  what  illnesses  are  autoimmune  diseases;
counts range from more than 80 to 150 diseases depending on the source.
Definitional  boundaries  of  autoimmunity  and  autoimmune  disease  are
evolving,  and  there  are  differing  approaches  to  characterizing  autoim-
mune  diseases—one  based  on  clinical  criteria  and  another  based  on
underlying  biological  mechanisms.  The  diseases  are  heterogeneous  in

presentation, and using stringent clinical criteria can impede the optimal
design of clinical trials and studies as well as the diagnosis and care of
patients.

Strong  epidemiologic  data  of  the  U.S.  incidence  and  prevalence  of
autoimmune  diseases  in  the  past  10–20  years  are  limited,  and  a  lack  of
population-based data is of particular concern. The last study that consid-
ered autoimmune diseases as a whole in the United States was published
in 2009 and estimated the prevalence of autoimmune diseases to be 7.6
to 9.4 percent—or 25 to 31 million people today.2 However, this estimate
was based on only 29 autoimmune diseases, and it does not account for
increases  in  prevalence  in  the  past  decade.  The  impact  of  autoimmune
diseases is significant, and trend data are showing an increasing incidence
and/or  prevalence  of  most  autoimmune  diseases  the  committee  exam-
ined, including in children, in whom an increased prevalence of inflam-
matory  bowel  disease  (IBD)  and  type  1  diabetes  were  observed  in  the
past decade. The earlier an autoimmune disease manifests, the longer an
individual must live with accruing damage, increased risks of complica-
tions and other conditions, and adverse effects on quality of life. No single
pattern of racial and ethnic disparities is seen in incidence or prevalence
among autoimmune diseases; for some conditions, the highest rates occur
among Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native populations, while for
others,  the  highest  rates  occur  in  White  populations.  Disparities  in  the
severity  and  prognosis  of  autoimmune  diseases  have  been  observed  as
well as disparities in the provision of care. There is little data on the direct
and indirect costs in the United States of specific autoimmune diseases or
of  autoimmune  diseases  overall.  However,  one  study  found  the  annual
direct  costs  of  multiple  sclerosis  to  be  second  only  to  congestive  heart
failure, and another estimated the average total lifetime cost for patients
with  Crohn’s  disease,  an  IBD,  to  be  $622,056.  Congressional  interest  in
autoimmune  diseases,  driven  largely  by  constituents,  advocacy  groups,
and other stakeholders, is longstanding, and congressional requests and
mandates  have  contributed  to  the  trajectory  of  National  Institutes  of
Health (NIH) autoimmune disease research.

CHARGE TO THE COMMITTEE

In response to a congressional request, NIH asked the National Acad-
emies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to form an expert committee

SUMMARY


to assess NIH research activities on autoimmune diseases with a particu-
lar  emphasis  on  the  risk  factors,  diagnostic  tools,  barriers  to  diagnoses,
treatments, and prospects for cures. The committee’s task also included
considering the occurrence of multiple autoimmune diseases in individu-
als and the interplay of the diseases with comorbidities, as well as iden-
tifying barriers to NIH-sponsored research, research gaps, and promising
areas for future NIH-sponsored research that would benefit the greatest
need. Box S-1 provides the committee’s Statement of Task.

COMMITTEE’S APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ITS CHARGE

The committee formed to address NIH’s task consisted of 13 experts
in  autoimmune  diseases,  immunology,  epidemiology,  environmental

BOX S-1

Statement of Task

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will convene

an  ad  hoc  committee  to  conduct  a  congressionally  mandated  study  of  NIH  re­
search on autoimmune diseases. The study will:

•	  Provide a general overview (with particular focus on NIH research efforts)

of epidemiologic trends in autoimmune diseases.

•	  For  common  autoimmune  diseases  (including  those  that  are  overrep­
resented  in  women),  evaluate  the  NIH  research  portfolio  with  particular
attention to issues such as risk factors; diagnostic tools; barriers to diag­
noses; treatments; and prospects for cures.

•	  Review NIH’s  research  activities  related  to  specific autoimmune diseas­
es,  the  occurrence  of  multiple  autoimmune  diseases  in  individuals,  and
the interplay of autoimmune diseases and comorbidities.

•	  Assess  trends  in  the  focus  of  NIH  research  and  address  whether  the
trends are reflective of the changes in epidemiology as compared to other
factors such as availability of research tools and technologies, and emerg­
ing biomedical knowledge and concepts.
Identify barriers to NIH-sponsored research and research gaps for autoim­
mune diseases.
Identify  promising  areas  for  future  NIH-sponsored  research  for  autoim­
mune diseases that would benefit the greatest need.



•	  Evaluate  Institute  and  Center  structure  in  support  of  NIH  autoimmune
disease research to identify where needs are met and where coordination
could be enhanced.

•	  Produce  and  publish  a  final  consensus  committee  report  summarizing
the committee’s findings, conclusions, and recommendations. The report
must address NIH accomplishments, challenges that NIH faces, as well
as possible solutions to the challenges.

health,  neurology,  nephrology,  gastroenterology,  cardiology,  psychiatry,
rheumatology,  disability,  pediatrics,  women’s  health,  sex  differences
research,  health  disparities  research,  and  research  administration.  The
committee  convened  virtually  10  times,  including  3  public  sessions  to
gather information from individuals with expertise on topics and subjects
of interest to the committee, including panels of representatives of NIH
Institutes  and  Centers  (ICs)  and  Offices;  and  experts  on  autoimmune
diseases and autoimmune disease research from academia and disease-
focused organizations.

Given the study timeframe, the committee chose a select number of
autoimmune diseases to examine as it would be unable to examine a large
set of diseases. Initially the committee cross-referenced diseases that two
autoimmune disease organizations3  agreed upon. To arrive at a final list,
the committee considered autoimmune diseases that are identified in con-
gressional language requesting this study; are overrepresented in women;
may affect multiple systems and are associated with comorbidities; and
that illustrate the spectrum of autoimmune diseases. A final consideration
was the availability of data on NIH research funding for the disease, as
the committee had determined that this could provide valuable informa-
tion on the focus of NIH’s autoimmune disease research portfolio.

The  committee  selected  11  diseases  for  special  focus:  Sjögren’s  dis-
ease,  systemic  lupus  erythematosus,  antiphospholipid  syndrome,  rheu-
matoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease
and ulcerative colitis), celiac disease, primary biliary cholangitis, multiple
sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune thyroid disease (Graves’ dis-
ease and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).

The Study Process and Information Gathering

The  committee  first  undertook  a  high-level  examination  of  the  11
select diseases that illustrate the spectrum of autoimmune diseases, inves-
tigating each for epidemiology and impact, risk factors and etiology, diag-
nostic tools, treatments and prospects for cures, heterogeneity in presenta-
tion, animal models aiding in the understanding of the disease, as well as
applicable research progress and gaps in answer to the statement of task.
With this context, the committee determined that the characteristics
that distinguish autoimmune diseases from each other are important and
provide  valuable  information  about  the  pathogenesis  of  each  disease.

3  The  Autoimmune  Association  is  a  nonprofit  organization  focused  on  the  impact  of
autoimmunity  and  the  eradication  of  autoimmune  diseases.  The  Autoimmune  Registry,
Inc., is a nonprofit organization serving as a hub for research, statistics, and patient data on
autoimmune diseases.

SUMMARY


However, the committee also recognized, and chose to highlight and dis-
cuss, the commonalities among autoimmune diseases.

The committee then undertook a review of the NIH research portfolio
on autoimmune disease. The general framework for this review included,
to  the  extent  possible,  reviewing  a  set  of  inputs  (spending),  activities
(research conducted), and outputs (clinical trials, patents, and other indi-
cators) of NIH’s investment in autoimmune disease research.

The  committee  examined  overall  NIH  spending for autoimmune  dis-
ease   research   grants   and   projects   and   that  of   13   ICs   that  contribute   the
most funding to  autoimmune  disease  research.  The  committee  examined
congressional   action   regarding  NIH  autoimmune   disease   research,   the
different types  of  NIH-funded  grants  and  awards,  the  process  for  review-
ing and  awarding grants, and  the  funding and  operation  of  extramural
and   intramural   programs.   The   committee   also   reviewed   NIH-wide   and
individual-IC  missions  and  strategic  plans;  autoimmune  disease-related
initiatives  involving collaboration;  and  NIH  approaches  to  coordinating
research.

To  examine  the  activities  of  the  NIH-funded  autoimmune  disease
research portfolio, the committee relied on two sources: NIH’s Research,
Condition,  and  Disease  Categorization  system  (RCDC)  and  the  NIH
Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) website. The com-
mittee analyzed data from fiscal year 2008, the first year for which data
were available, through fiscal year 2020, the last year for which data were
available at the time of analysis. All grants/projects categorized as being
in  the  RCDC  “autoimmune  diseases”  spending  category  for the  desig-
nated period were assembled, and the resulting 8,470 grants constituted
the  committee’s  research  database.  The  committee  determined  that  cer-
tain types of grants merited particular attention in portfolio evaluation;
investigator-initiated (R) grants, for example, are the bulk of NIH-funded
research. The specified award types were analyzed by the committee in
a variety of ways and according to NIH overall, individual ICs, and each
disease of interest.

The  statement  of  task  directed  the  committee  to  evaluate  the  NIH
research portfolio for issues such as risk  factors, diagnostic tools, barri-
ers to diagnoses, treatments, and prospects for cures. As reviewing 8,470
abstracts individually was not deemed feasible, the committee chose three
approaches to the task, and the methodologies for these appear in Chap-
ter  6  and Appendix  H.  The  first  applied  topic  modeling  to  identify  the
most  common  grant  research  topics  and  the  fluctuation  in  these  topics
over time. For the second approach, the committee searched the abstract
database  to  identify  which  other  NIH  RCDC  spending  categories  co-
occurred with the autoimmune disease-spending category; this analysis
provided  insight  into  themes  in  autoimmune  disease  research.  For  the


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

third  method,  committee  members  used  their  scientific  knowledge  and
expertise  to  review  a  sample  of  more  than  1,200  abstracts  to  assess  the
primary areas of research focus as identified in the statement of task.

The committee’s approach to assessing the accomplishments, or out-
puts,  of  funded  research  on  autoimmune  disease  included  a  high-level
examination of clinical trial activity, bibliometric indicators, and patents.
The methodologies are in Appendix G.

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

Based  on  its  review  of  the  literature,  the  committee  highlighted  the
characteristics   that  are   common   across   autoimmune   diseases   because
they provide  valuable  information  about disease  pathogenesis  that could
provide  direction for  more  targeted  research  that might lead  to  strategies
to  prevent,  delay,  diagnose,  treat,  and  cure  disease.  Considering autoim-
mune diseases  as  a  “group”  according to  “common  mechanisms  of  dis-
ease”  might provide  novel  insights  beyond  those  gained  by focusing on
the  affected  organ or  system,  or  on individual  diseases.  Below  are  areas
of  research  opportunity.

Genetics. Autoimmunity appears to require interaction between envi-
ronmental factors and one or more genes. Many of the genes that confer
susceptibility to autoimmune disease, and that the diseases share, regu-
late immune response; dysfunction of the immune response is critical to
the  development  of  autoimmune  disease.  Identifying  the  mechanisms
that  underlie  genotype–phenotype  associations  will  enable  researchers
to better target treatment.

Environmental exposures. Research supports a “second-hit” hypothesis—
that  a  genetic  profile  requires  an  additional  exposure  event  to  become
clinical  illness. Among  the  exposures  associated  with  autoimmune  dis-
eases  are  infectious  agents  and  respirable  silica.  Defining  the  type  and
duration  of  exposures  associated  with  disease  for  specific  diseases  and
across diseases, as well as defining the permutations of genes and envi-
ronmental exposures that lead to autoimmune diseases could benefit the
field.

Biomarkers. Biomarkers such as cytokines and autoantibodies can be
detected before clinical disease develops and an increase in pro-inflam-
matory cells, cytokines, and signaling pathways are implicated in disease
development. Identifying traditional and novel biomarkers could enable
disease  prediction,  which  coupled  with  advances  in  therapeutic  areas
could possibly be used to delay or prevent disease before clinical disease
develops, or modify disease outcomes.

Sex.  Sex  chromosomes,  sex  hormones,  and  the  effects  of  environ-
mental  exposures  on  sex  hormones  appear  to  play  a  role  in  differences

SUMMARY


between males and females in the occurrence and pathogenesis of autoim-
mune disease. Understanding this activity better could inform approaches
to diagnosis and treatment.

Autoimmune disease complications / coexisting autoimmune diseases. Both
are  common,  with  some  illnesses  occurring  across  several  autoimmune
diseases.  Examining  the  patterns  could  inform  the  understanding  of
pathophysiology  and  mechanistic  pathways  as  well  as  approaches  to
patient care.

Mechanistic  pathways  as  therapeutic  targets.  Mechanisms  of  immune-
mediated damage that leads to the varied clinical phenotypes of different
diseases may share common immune pathways. Identification of specific
proinflammatory signaling pathways and their cytokines as pathogenic in
autoimmune diseases has resulted in targeted therapeutics; some thera-
pies have been shared across diseases. Discovery of further pathways that
promote or inhibit autoimmune disease could inform drug development.
Animal  models.  Existing  animal  models  have  and  can  continue  to
help define common genetic and environmentally induced mechanisms.
Development of models for diseases that do not have models and contin-
ued development of a variety of novel culture, animal, and other models
to  better  answer  questions  posed  by  advances  in  translational  research
would benefit the field of autoimmune disease.

ANALYSIS OF INSTITUTE AND CENTER

AND SPECIFIC AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH ACTIVITY

In reviewing NIH’s research portfolio on autoimmune diseases, the
committee  employed  a  general  framework  that  considered  the  inputs
(spending),  activities  (research  conducted),  and  outputs  (clinical  trials,
patents, and other indicators) of NIH’s investment in autoimmune disease
research. It is notable that spending on autoimmune diseases as a percent-
age of overall NIH obligations has remained at only 2.6 percent between
2013 and 2020. This is in marked contrast to increases seen in overall NIH
obligations during the same period. In addition, the distribution of this
funding  for  autoimmune  diseases  indicates  that  certain  ICs  dominate
overall spending on research and training and the types of research activi-
ties funded.

An overview of the focus of the funded autoimmune research grants
as  requested  by  the  statement  of  task  was  conducted  using  three  dif-
ferent  methodologies—artificial  intelligence,  NIH  RCDC  spending  cat-
egories, and committee member judgement—yielding different levels of
specificity. While there was some consistency in the focus areas identified
among the three methods—the areas of pathophysiology of the immune


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

response, genetics, and treatment and therapy were common to all three
methods—some methods highlighted other areas of focus more readily.
For  accomplishments  associated  with  funded  research  on  autoim-
mune disease, the committee considered clinical trial activity, which rep-
resents translating research knowledge into interventions that influence
health-related biomedical or behavioral outcomes; bibliometric indicators;
and patents. With respect to clinical trials, there is a greater percentage of
clinical trials from filing years 2008 to 2020 for such autoimmune diseases
as type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, IBD, and rheumatoid
arthritis,  with  a  much  smaller  percentage  seen  for  other  autoimmune
diseases.  Further,  results  from  bibliometric  analyses  indicate  that  the
knowledge  associated  with  existing  research  grants  has  been  success-
fully  disseminated  to  the  research  community  through  publications  in
well-regarded scientific journals. In terms of patent applications, filings
occur primarily for some autoimmune diseases with far fewer filings for
others. In general, findings related to research outputs suggest the need
for a nuanced and in-depth examination of why progress via clinical trials
and patent filings does not seem to have been made for certain autoim-
mune diseases.

Despite  the  generation  of  important  information  summarizing  the
autoimmune  disease  research  enterprise,  the  committee  encountered
substantial challenges in making quantitative or qualitative judgements
about the portfolio and the progress made to address the broad range of
autoimmune diseases. In part, this is because a recent overarching stra-
tegic  research  plan  with  implementation  goals  and  milestones  does  not
exist, thus the committee was unable to discern concrete metrics against
which progress could be assessed.

OPPORTUNITIES AND OPTIONS FOR ENHANCING

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH AT NIH

The  committee’s  formal  review  of  the  NIH  autoimmune  disease
research  portfolio  confirms  that  much  extraordinary  work  related  to
autoimmune disease has been undertaken and likely will continue. The
committee also faced a daunting task given the evolving areas of autoim-
munity and autoimmune disease, differing approaches to defining auto-
immune disease, lack of consensus on what diseases they include, and a
lack of epidemiologic data. The examination of the 11 diseases highlights
the complexity of autoimmune diseases ranging from molecular mecha-
nisms to individuals, families and populations affected, heterogeneity in
presentation and evolution of the disease, and available treatments and
responses to therapy. The committee agreed that the diseases’ common-
alities  may  provide  additional  and  significant  insights  that  can  further

SUMMARY


the development of patient care and therapies, and as such may offer the
greatest opportunity for advancing the field.

The general framework for the review of the NIH autoimmune dis-
ease research portfolio includes inputs (funding, organizational structure
and  administrative  processes,  IC  missions  and  strategies,  collaborative
initiatives, and methods of collaboration), activities (the kinds of research
funded), and outputs or accomplishments.

Major barriers to NIH’s ability to maximize outcomes of this research
portfolio  is  the  variation  found  in  IC  strategic  plans  regarding  autoim-
mune diseases and most significantly, the absence of a research plan that
spans  all  ICs  to  provide  an  overall  strategic  NIH  plan  for  autoimmune
diseases. Absent the latter, NIH lacks a comprehensive, transparent, and
strategic approach to how it plans and evaluates progress made on auto-
immune disease research.

The  committee  determined  that  five  essential  elements  are  neces-
sary  for  rapid  advancement  and  improvement  in  autoimmune  disease
research:


	 Strategic research planning to set priorities
	 An  emphasis  on  coordinating  across  ICs  and  enhancing  collab-
orative  research  given  the  crosscutting  nature  of  autoimmune
diseases

3.	  An orientation toward innovation

	 A focus on evaluating the autoimmune research portfolio in order

to determine progress made across NIH

	 Resources to support planning, collaboration, and innovation


While  the  committee  recognizes  that  the  diffuse  and  investigator-
initiated nature of NIH research and of autoimmune disease research in
particular has many well-described and accepted advantages, NIH does
not optimally promote these five elements.

Identifying  gaps  and  opportunities  can  be  achieved  by  a  relatively
independent,  structured,  and  ongoing  examination  of  the  research  con-
ducted.  This  can  then  inform  planning  for  how  to  most  successfully
address those gaps and opportunities, which would also benefit from a
detailed  but  not  prescriptive  strategic  plan.  Neither  a  rigorous  evalua-
tion nor strategic planning currently occurs in an overarching, sustained,
and  resourced  fashion.  There  currently  is  no  overarching  strategic  plan
guiding research activities and IC collaboration on autoimmune research
activities.

The  committee  identified  an  opportunity  not  just  for  filling  gaps
that may fall between the work of diverse ICs but also for capturing and
leveraging  an  understanding  of  the  crosscutting  nature  of  autoimmune


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

diseases,  including  their  underlying  common  disease  mechanisms,  risk
factors, and shared concomitant conditions. The committee believes that
the  emerging  and  evolving  science  now  makes  those  connections  more
achievable than ever before. Such information could be building blocks
for,  and  could  accelerate  innovative  progress  toward  prevention,  early
diagnosis, treatment, and cure.

Some  of  this  work  can  advance  without  the  infusion  of  major  new
resources.  However  the  committee  believes  that  any  centralized  entity,
to be effective, will require new resources; and that the broader and bet-
ter research enterprise on autoimmune disease has a greater potential to
bring relief to patients and their families.

The  committee  considered  five  options  for  enhancing  autoimmune
disease  research  and  resulting  outcomes.  These  included  (1)  increased
funding for autoimmune disease research; (2a) coordination through revi-
talization of the NIH Autoimmune Disease Coordinating Committee; (2b)
coordination through creation of a U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services Autoimmune Disease Coordinating Committee; (3) development
of  a  congressionally  mandated  national  autoimmune  diseases/autoim-
munity research plan; (4) creation of a new National Institute of Autoim-
mune Disease and Autoimmunity Research; and (5) creation of an Office
of Autoimmune Disease/Autoimmunity Research within the Office of the
Director of NIH. The pros and cons, costs, and feasibility of each option
are discussed in Chapter 7.

The committee found that the best option for addressing these chal-
lenges and opportunities would be the creation of an Office of Autoim-
mune Disease/Autoimmunity Research within the Office of the Director
of NIH. It found significant merit in this option, provided the option is
pursued in a way in which it is likely to succeed.

Such  an  Office  would  be  positioned  to  respond  to  the  committee’s

concerns by:


Facilitating cross-NIH multidisciplinary collaboration and stimu-
lating innovation around autoimmune disease research

	 Engaging in priority setting, strategic planning, and implementation
	 Budgeting  for  and  allocating  available  research  funds  in  align-

ment with the strategic plan

	 Managing and evaluating research efforts
	 Communicating with key stakeholders
	 Providing visible leadership on autoimmune disease research.


This option is not a new one and was proposed in a bill advanced by then
Senator Joe Biden in 1999.

Realistically,  as  governmental  units  at  NIH  and  elsewhere  persua-
sively argue to the Congress, the impact of a research organization is likely

SUMMARY


to be correlated with the extent to which it owns and controls resources.
This is particularly true in the case of new entities advising on and nego-
tiating the activities of multiple actors who are already resourced. Given
this, the committee considered two configurations of this Office.

In  the  first,  the  Office  would  have  its  own  research  budget  and  it
would substantially control certain key budgetary decisions about auto-
immune  disease  research  activities  conducted  elsewhere  in  NIH.  In  the
second configuration, while the Office would have certain responsibilities,
it  would  receive  only  modest  or  limited  resources  or  authority  to  carry
them  out.  Current  Offices  have  budgets  that  range  widely,  which  can
affect an Office’s ability to fund research, and most Offices are permitted
to fund grants only in collaboration with an IC. The ability of the Office
of AIDS Research to allocate congressionally appropriated funds for AIDS
research is unusual. The committee recommends the former, fully recog-
nizing that budgetary control is among the most sensitive issues within
any  organization.  The  committee  recognizes  that  some  middle  ground
might need to be struck.

Success will also depend on tailoring the Office to specific and man-
ageable  objectives.  Further,  a  successful  crosscutting  Office  needs  the
capacity to suggest and advance creative new scientific approaches, part-
ners, and paradigms. While effective offices recognize the importance of
living within institutional cultures and constraints, they can still suggest
and direct new ways of doing business that others may not see, have the
time or expertise to consider, or the resources to pursue. This, in the view
of the committee, is how a new Office of Autoimmune Disease/Autoim-
munity Research within the Office of the NIH Director would provide its
greatest value.

As noted above, the committee believes that successful implementa-
tion of any option will depend on careful attention to a variety of criti-
cal success factors in addition to budget considerations. Simply put, the
committee believes that no new office is preferable to one that is not sub-
stantive, serious, supported, well defined, and well resourced. NIH is an
institution with world-class expertise, billions of dollars in resources, and
extraordinarily high standards. No one benefits when a new organization
is created at NIH that does not meet those standards.

With  these  provisos,  the  committee  believes  that  a  well-configured
Office  of  Autoimmune  Disease/Autoimmunity  Research  could  be  an
essential ingredient in further stimulating promising and impactful auto-
immune disease and autoimmunity research at NIH that can be translated
into clinical practices that will prevent autoimmune disease or improve
the lives of those living with autoimmune disease. The responsibilities the
committee envisions for the Office appear in Box S-2.


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

BOX S-2

Duties of the Office as Envisioned by Committee

A.	  The Office would devise a process for and lead the collaborative development of
a Strategic Plan to  address  opportunities  and  gaps  in  scientific  knowledge. This
would result in an NIH Strategic Plan for Autoimmune Disease and Autoimmunity
Related Research. The plan would:
1.	  Establish both a high-level blueprint and a more detailed research agenda.
2.	  Set both high-level national priorities and detailed disease-specific and cross­

cutting priorities.

3.	  Describe a detailed research program and implementation plan for carrying

out that agenda.

4.	  Work with ICs to identify and promote research opportunities that align with
strategic  plan  goals  (e.g.,  developing  solicited  requests  for  applications
(RFAs)  for  crosscutting  research  grants,  promoting  Small  Business  Inno­
vation  Research  (SBIR)  and  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer  (STTR)
Programs grants).

5.	  Address autoimmune disease research workforce and training issues, includ­

ing diversity of the workforce.

6.	  Provide  metrics  for  evaluating  progress  and  a  process  for  applying  those

metrics.

7.	  Examine scientific and organizational barriers to breakthroughs and potential

solutions.

In  developing  and  implementing  the  strategic  plan,  the  Office  would  actively  seek
the collaboration and engagement of IC intramural and extramural investigators
and   other   stakeholders.   This   outreach   would   serve   to   catalyze   innovation   and
identify emerging areas of research opportunity. Strengthening outreach could also
inform funding for other important research priorities undertaken by various ICs.

In   support   of   strategic   planning,   the   Office,   in   collaboration   with   ICs   and   other
stakeholders,  should  develop  a  consensus  vocabulary  that  includes  both  clini
cally   defined   autoimmune   diseases   and   autoimmune   mechanisms   and   a   list   of
autoimmune  diseases.  Such  a  definition  and  list  of  diseases  is  critical  to  improve
research and data collection, and guide patient care and coordinate communica
tion.  Periodic  reassessment  of  the  definition  and  listing  of  autoimmune  diseases
should be undertaken based upon emerging data.

B.	  The Office would ensure that funds are invested in the areas of highest scientific

priority. The Office would:
1.	  Engage in developing detailed autoimmune disease research budgets.
2.	  Set budgetary priorities and attempt to align available dollars.
3.	  With its own resources fund certain activities including those that are cross­
cutting; high risk/reward; relevant to special populations; and related to work­
force development.

SUMMARY


C.	  The Office would provide scientific coordination and management of the research

program. This would include:
1.	  Serving as a focal point for external parties seeking information or providing

input on autoimmune disease research opportunities at NIH.

2.	  Serving  as  a  convener  for  emerging  and  crosscutting  science  on  autoim­
mune disease. Collaborating with organizations focused on persons-centered
research  like  the  Patient-Centered  Outcomes  Research  Institute  and  other
stakeholders—industry,  disease  organizations,  patient  advocacy,  and  pa­
tients and their families—in priority setting and research design.
3.	  Stimulating novel approaches to autoimmune disease research.

Leveraging  existing  efforts  and  develop  synergies  across  multiple  ICs  and
scientific disciplines.

5.	  Coordinating  with  the  Center  for  Scientific  Review  to  review  assignment
guidelines to ensure that autoimmune diseases grants are assigned to the ap­
propriate study sections with optimal representation of experts and expertise,
including  expertise  for  reviewing  basic  science  (i.e.,  tissue  culture,  animal,
translational) and human studies, and evaluate assignment guidelines on an
ongoing basis.

6.	  Coordinating existing autoimmune disease data-collection systems and bio­
repository resources across NIH; creating a database of such resources to
facilitate  research  collaboration;  and  coordinating  with  external  databases
that  may  have  useful  data  (e.g.,  the  VA  Million  Veterans  Program,  the  UK
Biobank, and industry biorepositories).

7.	  Coordinating autoimmune disease research across other HHS agencies and
other  federal  agencies  (e.g., Agency  for  Healthcare  Research  and  Quality,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration)
to promote cohesion in efforts to advance generation of knowledge and care
delivery for autoimmune disease.

D.	  The Office would conduct or contract for evaluations of ongoing efforts.

E.	  The Office would produce annual reports on the progress made on autoimmune
disease research activities for Congress. Annual congressional reports can provide
key information on priorities and outcomes to enable policymakers to assess the
level of funding for autoimmune disease research. Others who could benefit from
such information are key stakeholders in the autoimmune research enterprise and
members of the public.

F.	  Building  on  this  report  and  other  relevant  reviews,  the  Office  would  lead  the  de­
velopment of an enhanced information system for autoimmune disease research.
The  committee’s  efforts  revealed  challenges  researchers  and  policymakers  may
face in easily accessing, synthesizing, and analyzing relevant research opportuni­
ties and results. The committee believes that, consistent with NIH’s existing and
excellent information systems, more can be done to allow researchers ready but
refined access to research opportunities and ongoing research efforts.


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

The committee’s recommendations follow, the introduction for Rec-

ommendation 1 having been provided.

Recommendation  1:  The  Director  of  the  National  Institutes  of
Health  should  create  an  Office  of  Autoimmune  Disease/Autoim­
munity Research within the Office of the Director.

Acknowledging  that  creating  an  Office  of  Autoimmune  Disease/
Autoimmunity Research may take some time, the committee makes two
specific recommendations related to data collection that could be imple-
mented  independent  of  the  Office  by  ICs,  one  independently  and  the
other  in  collaboration  with  other  ICs.  First,  progress  on  autoimmune
disease  requires  substantially  more  sophisticated  and  refined  epidemi-
ology  on  the  individual  and  aggregate  burden  of  autoimmune  disease.
The  extant  knowledge  base  is  growing,  but  there  are  important  gaps,
including  incidence  and  prevalence  trends,  comprehensive  evaluations
of the risk factors and the burden (including direct and indirect costs) of
these diseases, the impact on different populations, the trajectory of these
diseases from the period before disease manifests through the life course,
and the impact of specific treatments and interventions.

The  committee  found  a  lack  of  long-term  (20  years  or  more)  popu-
lation-based epidemiology studies on autoimmune disease.  Such stud-
ies  would  allow  for  assessing  trends,  identifying  differences  among
population  subgroups,  and  determining  the  prevalence  and  incidence
of under-researched autoimmune diseases and conditions, such as celiac
disease. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End  Results  Program,  which  provides  information  on  cancer  incidence
and  survival  in  the  United  States,  is  a  model  for  such  studies  already
existing at NIH.

Recommendation 2: The National Institutes of Health should estab­
lish  long-term  systems  to  collect  and  ensure  optimum  usability
of  population-based  surveillance  and  epidemiological  data  (e.g.,
incidence,  prevalence)  on  autoimmune  diseases  and  measures  of
autoimmunity (e.g., autoantibodies, inflammation) and support the
optimization of existing data sources.

The  committee  also  found  that  few  studies  exist  that  are  able  to
provide  information  on  the  long-term  progression  of  autoimmune  dis-
ease  beginning  in  the  period  before  disease  manifests  through  the  life
course. Such studies would allow for a greater understanding of the het-
erogeneity of disease expression and changes with time and over various

SUMMARY


life  stages.  Such  studies  could  be  designed  to  address  wide  variety  of
disease outcomes and health effects.

Establishing  population  cohorts  is  critical  for  studying  mechanisms
leading to autoimmune diseases. Early life exposures and timing of these
exposures influence health at different life stages at a population and indi-
vidual patient level. Autoimmune diseases are long-lasting heterogeneous
conditions for which manifestations and comorbidities change over time.
It is essential to support long-term (10–20+ years) patient cohort studies.
Such studies would provide understanding of opportunities for develop-
ing clinical treatments and behavioral interventions.

Recommendation 3: The National Institutes of Health should sup­
port  the  development  of  population  cohorts  that  extend  from  the
period before disease manifests to the development of symptoms
and disease, and should support patient cohorts that will allow the
examination  of  the  progression,  coexisting  morbidities,  and  long­
term (20+ years) outcomes of autoimmune diseases. Data collection
should include, but need not be limited to:

•	  Genome-wide association
•	  Environmental and occupational exposures such as respirable

silica, vitamin D and iodine, viruses, and smoking

•	  Autoantibody, cytokine, and T cell assays, particularly in new-

onset disease

•	  Response  to  therapeutic  interventions,  including  timing  of
treatment (e.g., to assess whether early treatments prevent dis­
ease progression)

•	  Development of co-occurring autoimmune diseases

Finally, to address the research gaps outlined throughout this report,
a  comprehensive  national  research  agenda  for  autoimmune  diseases  is
required. Achieving this objective will require coordination and collabo-
ration  among  researchers,  research  groups,  and  stakeholders  as  well  as
the  dedicated  pursuit  of  research  that  defines  autoantibodies  that  pre-
dict and diagnose autoimmune diseases; identifies common mechanisms
in  inflammation;  determines  gene–environment  interactions  within  and
across  autoimmune  diseases;  examines  the  role  of  environmental  expo-
sures  on  autoimmune  diseases;  elucidates  disparities  and  their  deter-
minants;  determines  the  impact  of  comorbidities  and  complications  of
autoimmune diseases on clinical outcomes, functional outcomes, quality
of life, and health care utilization; and explores the effect of interventions
to mitigate impact of comorbidities and complications for patients with
autoimmune disease across the lifespan.


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Recommendation  4:  The  National  Institutes  of  Health  should
provide  funding  and  support  for  a  national  research  agenda  that
addresses key gaps identified by the committee. Prioritized research
streams  should  include,  but  need  not  be  limited  to,  clinical  and
basic research that addresses the research streams below.

•	  Dissect heterogeneity across and within autoimmune diseases to
decipher common and disease-specific pathogenic mechanisms
•	  Study rare autoimmune diseases and develop supporting ani­

mal models


	 Define  autoantibodies  and  other  biomarkers  that  can  diag­
nose and predict the initiation and progression of autoimmune
diseases

•	  Determine the biologic functions of genetic variants and gene–
environment  interactions  within  and  across  autoimmune  dis­
eases using novel, cutting-edge technologies

•	  Examine the role of environmental exposures and social deter­
minants of health in autoimmune diseases across the lifespan
•	  Determine the impact of coexisting morbidities, including co-
occurring  autoimmune  diseases  and  complications  of  autoim­
mune  diseases,  across  the  lifespan,  and  develop  and  evaluate
interventions to improve patient outcomes.

•	  Foster  research  to  advance  health  equity  for  all  autoimmune

disease patients

The committee provides detailed subheadings for these research areas

in Chapter 7.

CONCLUSION

The  quantity  and  quality  of  the  research  NIH  conducts  on  autoim-
mune diseases is impressive. The committee believes that a strategic plan
for all NIH autoimmune disease research and a well-configured and well-
funded Office to support the coordination and collaboration of all ICs that
can play a role in advancing the field represent an opportunity for NIH
both  to  optimize  its  significant  resources  and  to  maximize  the  ground
covered by the research it conducts.


Introduction

Autoimmune diseases occur when the body’s immune system, which
normally  defends  the  body  against  disease  and  infection,  malfunctions
and mistakenly attacks healthy cells, tissues, and organs (NIEHS, 2021).
These attacks can affect any part of the body, and damage may target a
specific organ system or be systemic (Fridkis-Hareli, 2008). For some dis-
eases, diagnosis can be problematic; people can experience symptoms and
accrue  tissue  damage  for  years  and  consult  multiple  physicians  before
receiving a correct diagnosis (Arbuckle et al., 2003; Calabrese et al., 2021;
Dall’Era, 2013). Pain is a common symptom, and nerve dysfunction can
amplify pain sensations (Mifflin and Kerr, 2017). People with autoimmune
diseases  commonly  develop  more  than  one  autoimmune  disease  (Cojo-
caru et al., 2010; Rojas-Villarraga et al., 2012), and they can be at increased
risk of developing cancer (Franks and Slansky, 2012) and cardiovascular
disease (Williams et al., 2019) among other comorbidities and complica-
tions. Autoimmune diseases are chronic and lifelong and can cause signif-
icant physical and psychosocial impairment, impeding activities of daily
living, productivity, and quality of life. In children, autoimmune diseases
can cause irreversible organ damage at an early age and adversely affect
growth and development, with lasting effects into adulthood (Amaro and
Chiarelli, 2020; Cirillo et al., 2017; Groot et al., 2019; Heshin-Bekenstein et
al., 2018; Lim et al., 2013, 2017; Mauras et al., 2021; Mitchell, 2017; Ruano
et al., 2018). Autoimmune disease can also be fatal; uncontrolled type 1
diabetes  is  well-known  to  be  life-threatening  (Reno  et  al.,  2018),  a  2018
study determined systemic lupus erythematosus to be a leading cause of



ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

death in young females in the United States (Yen and Singh, 2018), and
autoimmune  diseases  as  a  group  rank  among  the  10  leading  causes  of
death for females (Thomas et al., 2010; Walsh and Rau, 2000). There are
no known cures for autoimmune diseases.

There  are  limited  data  on  the  incidence  and  prevalence  of  autoim-
mune diseases. In 2005, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Autoim-
mune  Diseases  Coordinating  Committee  (ADCC)1  estimated  that  auto-
immune  diseases  affect  14.7  to  23.5  million  people  in  the  United  States
(ADCC, 2005). More recent epidemiologic data are inadequate to provide
an updated estimate of the U.S. prevalence of autoimmune diseases, but
the  number  is  likely  higher  given  the  increase  in  the  U.S.  population
(United States Census Bureau, 2021) and the prevalence of some autoim-
mune  diseases  and  autoantibodies  appears  to  be  growing  (Dinse  et  al.,
2020;  Mayer-Davis  et  al.,  2017;  Shivashankar  et  al.,  2017).  The  personal
and societal costs of autoimmune diseases are substantial but difficult to
estimate overall, because costs are attributed mostly to specific diagnoses
and because calculations of acute care costs, medications, hospitalizations,
and  annual  or  lifetime  costs,  for  example,  are  not  standardized  across
autoimmune diseases (AARDA and NCAPG, 2011).

NIH,  the  U.S.  federal  agency  primarily  responsible  for  sponsoring
and conducting biomedical research, supports research on autoimmune
disease.2 NIH’s stated mission is to “seek fundamental knowledge about
the  nature  and  behavior  of  living  systems  and  the  application  of  that
knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and dis-
ability” (NIH, 2017). The agency conducts its mission and goals through a
complex and multidisciplinary structure of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs),
each focusing on different areas of biomedical research. The Office of the
Director  sets  policies  and  coordinates  the  activities  of  the  ICs. Autoim-
mune disease research activities occur across the ICs through both extra-
mural and intramural research activities. In fiscal year 2020, NIH’s budget
obligations3  were  approximately  $41.5  billion,  of  which  NIH  spent  $1.1

1 NIH established the ADCC in 1998 in response to congressional encouragement to facili-
tate coordination of autoimmune disease research across NIH, federal agencies, professional
societies, and patient and advocacy organizations (NIAID, 2021).

2 NIH is one of the 11 operating divisions in the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services  (HHS,  2022).  The  other  10  operating  divisions  are  Administration  for  Children
and Families (ACF), Administration for Community Living (ACL), Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ), Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices (CMS), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health Resources and Services Admin-
istration  (HRSA),  Indian  Health  Service  (IHS),  and  Substance  Abuse  and  Mental  Health
Services Administration (SAMHSA).

billion,  or  2.6  percent  of  the  NIH  obligations,  supporting  autoimmune
disease research (NIH, 2020, 2021).

In language supporting the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act,
2020,4  Congress noted that autoimmune diseases affect an estimated 5 to
7 percent of Americans; that these diseases are more common in women
than men; and that many women with one autoimmune disease have a
second autoimmune disease or other condition. That language also stated
that “there is no single office within National Institutes of Health tasked
with coordinating research across the agency or examining the complex
interplay among these diseases and conditions,” and it called for NIH to
contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medi-
cine (National Academies) to identify and review NIH’s research efforts
in  this  broad  area.  In  response,  the  National  Academies  convened  the
Committee for the Assessment of NIH Research on Autoimmune Diseases
(the committee) to respond to this request. The 13-member interdisciplin-
ary  committee  consisted  of  experts  in  autoimmune  diseases,  immunol-
ogy, epidemiology, environmental health, neurology, nephrology, gastro-
enterology,  cardiology,  psychiatry,  rheumatology,  disability,  pediatrics,
women’s health, sex differences research, health disparities research, and
research administration. One member of the committee has had multiple
sclerosis for years, providing insight into the lived experience of having
an autoimmune disease. More information about the committee members
can be found in Appendix A.

Charge to the Committee

The Statement of Task guiding this study charged the committee to
assess  NIH  research  activities  on  autoimmune  diseases  with  a  particu-
lar  emphasis  on  the  risk  factors,  diagnostic  tools,  barriers  to  diagnoses,
treatments, and prospects for cures. The committee’s task also included
considering  the  occurrence  of  multiple  autoimmune  diseases  and  the
interplay  of  the  diseases  with  comorbidities,  as  well  as  identifying  bar-
riers to NIH-sponsored research, research gaps, and promising areas for
future NIH-sponsored research that would benefit the greatest need. Box
1-1 provides the committee’s Statement of Task.

Committee’s Approach

mune disease research funding focused on a select number of autoimmune

BOX 1-1

Statement of Task

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine will convene

an  ad  hoc  committee  to  conduct  a  congressionally  mandated  study  of  NIH  re­
search on autoimmune diseases. The study will:

•	  Provide a general overview (with particular focus on NIH research efforts)

of epidemiologic trends in autoimmune diseases.

•	  For common autoimmune diseases (including those that are overrepresent­
ed in women), evaluate the NIH research portfolio with particular attention
to  issues  such  as  risk  factors;  diagnostic  tools;  barriers  to  diagnoses;
treatments; and prospects for cures.

•	  Review  NIH’s  research  activities  related  to  specific  autoimmune  diseas­
es, the occurrence of multiple autoimmune diseases in individuals, and the
interplay of autoimmune diseases and comorbidities.

•	  Assess trends in the focus of NIH research and address whether the trends
are reflective of the changes in epidemiology as compared to other factors
such as availability of research tools and technologies, and emerging bio­
medical knowledge and concepts.
Identify barriers to NIH-sponsored research and research gaps for autoim­
mune diseases.
Identify  promising  areas  for  future  NIH-sponsored  research  for  autoim­
mune diseases that would benefit the greatest need.



•	  Evaluate  Institute  and  Center  structure  in  support  of  NIH  autoimmune
disease research to identify where needs are met and where coordination
could be enhanced.

•	  Produce  and  publish  a  final  consensus  committee  report  summarizing  the
committee’s  findings,  conclusions,  and  recommendations.  The  report  must
address  NIH  accomplishments,  challenges  that  NIH  faces,  as  well  as  pos­
sible solutions to the challenges.

conditions  over  a  select  period  of  time.  The  committee  notes  that  there
is neither a consensus definition of autoimmune disease, nor a standard
list of autoimmune diseases, though the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) identifies more than 80 autoimmune diseases
(NIAID,  2017).  In  addition,  the  Autoimmune  Registry5  and  the  Auto-
immune  Association  (formerly  named  American  Autoimmune  Related

Diseases Association, or AARDA)6  compiled two longer lists of autoim-
mune diseases that include 147 and 150 diseases, respectively (Autoim-
mune  Association,  2021b;  Autoimmune  Registry  Inc.,  2020).  Appendix
B  lists  the  diseases  the  Autoimmune  Association  identifies  as  autoim-
mune  diseases.  The  committee  acknowledged  that  given  the  timeframe
it had to conduct its work, it would be unable to examine a large set of
autoimmune diseases. As an initial step in selecting a set of diseases, the
committee cross-referenced the Autoimmune Association list of diseases
with the list of diseases that the Autoimmune Registry designates as hav-
ing  “strong”  evidence  for  being  autoimmune  diseases.  The  committee
deemed the resulting list to be a reasonable starting point from which to
choose.

Autoimmune Diseases of Focus

A number of factors contributed to the committee’s selection of auto-
immune  diseases. Box 1-2 lists these  factors, and Table 1-1 lists the dis-
eases the committee selected.

The  committee  acknowledges  that  there  are  autoimmune  diseases
that are more rare than the diseases it selected for special focus, but the
committee believes that including rare diseases could have diminished its
ability to answer the questions with which it had been tasked.

BOX 1-2

Factors Considered in Selecting Diseases for Special Focus

•	  Autoimmune diseases identified in Congressional Record H11061-01, 2019.
•	  Diseases overrepresented in women.
•	  Diseases that may affect multiple systems and are associated with comor­

bidities.1

•	  Diseases that illustrate the spectrum of autoimmune disease.
•	  Availability of NIH data on research funding for the disease.

1 More  granular  definitions  of  coexisting  disease  (comorbidity,  complication,  co-occurring

autoimmune disease, and overlapping autoimmune disease) are provided in Chapter 2.

immune Related Disorders [AARDA]) is a nonprofit organization focused on the eradication
of autoimmune diseases and impact of autoimmunity (Autoimmune Association, 2021a).

INTRODUCTION


Autoimmune Diseases Identified in Congressional Record and
Overrepresentation of Women

The language supporting the call for the National Academies study
specifically noted the following autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthri-
tis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease,
and type 1 diabetes. The congressional language also included a reference
to  the  2010  National  Academies  study  Women’s  Health  Research:  Prog­
ress,  Pitfalls,  and  Promise  that  identified  autoimmune  conditions  as  “the
leading  cause  of  morbidity  in  women,  and  they  affect  women’s  quality
of  life  greatly”  (IOM,  2010).  The  Statement  of  Task  does  not  direct  the
committee to focus exclusively on women’s health, but it does direct the
committee to examine “common autoimmune diseases (including those
overrepresented in women).” The committee decided to include the six
diseases  identified  in  the  congressional  language  along  with  Sjögren’s
disease  (sometimes  called  Sjögren’s  syndrome),  psoriasis,  antiphospho-
lipid  syndrome,  primary  biliary  cholangitis,  and  autoimmune  thyroid
disease, each of which also affects more women than men. The commit-
tee notes that while many autoimmune diseases do occur predominantly
in women, multiple other patterns occur across autoimmune diseases in
relation to age, sex, race and ethnicity, and social determinants. Variations
also exist in other dimensions of autoimmune disease, including progres-
sion of disease and outcomes.

Diseases That May Encompass Multiple Systems and Comorbidities.

Unlike  many  other  illnesses,  autoimmune  diseases  affect  multiple
organ systems (e.g., skin, kidney, lung, joints, and brain), sometimes lead-
ing to different manifestations with different names. Many autoimmune
diseases  overlap;  for  example,  features  of  Sjögren’s  disease  or  Hashi-
moto’s  thyroiditis  (also  called  Hashimoto’s  disease)  often  accompany
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematous, and related illnesses.
There is little consensus whether such patients have one or several auto-
immune diseases.

Diseases That Collectively Illustrate the Spectrum of Autoimmune Diseases

The committee sought to select diseases that could illustrate the spec-
trum of autoimmune disease, which is diverse in organ systems affected,
disease  course,  patient  population,  time  of  onset,  and  severity,  among
other  factors.  For  example,  type  1  diabetes  is  a  disease  that  most  often
arises  in  children,  adolescents,  and  young  adults,  while  systemic  lupus
erythematous  usually  first  manifests  in  young  adulthood,  and  multiple

 Common in Autoimmune Disease

•  Most common in women
•  Can be diagnosed at different ages (Ramos-Casals et al., 2021)
•  May affect nearly any organ system
•  May involve systemic features and profound pain and fatigue
•  Associated with complications during pregnancy
•  Associated with increased risk of developing cancer (Vivino et al., 2019)
•  May lead to disability
•  Autoimmune response is complex and progresses over years
•  Commonly co-occurs with other autoimmune diseases

sclerosis during midlife; however, each of these illnesses can occur at any
age (Bar-Or, 2016; Cartee et al., 2016; Dall’Era et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2014;
Somers et al., 2014).

Availability of NIH Data on Research Spending for Autoimmune Disease

The  committee  determined  that  NIH  funding  data  would  provide
valuable information on the focus of NIH’s autoimmune disease research
portfolio. The committee relied on two sources for that information: NIH’s
Research,  Condition,  and  Disease  Categorization  system  (RCDC)  and
the  NIH  Research  Portfolio  Online  Reporting  Tools  (RePORT)  website.7
RCDC provides an overview of NIH funding, including a broad category
for “autoimmune diseases” (referred to as “parent category”) and seven
subcategories (referred to as “child categories”) of autoimmune diseases.8
These  “child  categories”  provide  added  transparency  to  the  public  on
funding for specific autoimmune diseases. The RePORT website provides
public access to a variety of reporting tools, reports, data, and analyses of
NIH research activities. One of the tools available on the RePORT web-
site is the RePORTER module that allows users to search a repository of

7 The NIH Reform Act of 2006 encouraged NIH to prioritize consistency and transparency
in the reporting of its funded research. Implemented in 2008, the RCDC system uses sophis-
ticated text data mining (categorizing and clustering using words and multiword phrases) in
conjunction with NIH-wide definitions used to match projects to specific funding categories
(ERA, 2019; NIH, 2020).

8  The  child  categories  of  the  parent  category  “autoimmune  disease”  are  inflammatory
bowel  disease  (includes  Crohn’s  disease),  lupus,  multiple  sclerosis,  rheumatoid  arthritis,
scleroderma,  psoriasis,  myasthenia  gravis,  and  all  other  autoimmune  disease  research  at
NIH (McNamara, 2021).

INTRODUCTION


NIH-funded intramural and extramural research grants by RCDC spend-
ing categories and to access publications and patents resulting from NIH
funding.

The committee analyzed data from fiscal year 2008 to 2020, the last
year  for  which  data  were  available  at  the  time  of  analysis.  To  expedite
data analysis, an external contractor with experience using NIH RePORT
tools provided assistance in reviewing data on publications, clinical trials,
and patents resulting directly from NIH autoimmune funded work. Appen-
dix G describes the methods used to perform RePORTER analyses.

To aid in assessing the 2008–2020 autoimmune disease research port-
folio for the appearance of research topic patterns and trends, an external
consultant used an artificial intelligence program to apply topic model-
ing, a form of statistical modeling, to the data. Appendix H describes the
methodology. The committee used PICO Portal, a publications manage-
ment  tool,  to  review  sampled  abstracts  of  funded  research  grants.  The
rationale and methods for sampling and for the committee’s review can
be found in Chapter 6.

The Study Process and Information Gathering

The committee convened virtually 10 times, and between these meet-
ings,  small  groups  of  committee  members  participated  in  virtual  meet-
ings or conference calls to advance their work. The committee held three
public sessions to gather information from individuals with expertise on
topics and subjects of interest to the committee, including panels of rep-
resentatives of NIH ICs and Offices; experts on autoimmune diseases and
autoimmune disease research from academia and disease-focused organi-
zations; and individuals with autoimmune disease who provided insights
into their lived experiences. The committee held public sessions during its
first three meetings; Appendix C lists the agendas and presentation topics.
In  addition  to  information  provided  by  invited  speakers,  at  the
instruction of the committee, National Academies staff interviewed NIH
representatives to gather information on approaches NIH uses to advance
collaboration on and coordination of autoimmune disease research, both
in and outside NIH. The committee also obtained information from NIH
via  direct  request  to  the  relevant  Offices  or  ICs.  These  inquiries  sought
background and details on issues raised during presentations and com-
mittee  deliberations  and  on  the  NIH  RePORT  tools.  All  presentations
and responses to information requests are available in the public access
file  for  the  project.9  Information  on  the  missions,  priorities,  programs,

collaborations, and funding processes of NIH ICs came from a review of
NIH websites supplemented with information presented by representa-
tives of ICs and Offices of NIH at the committee’s public sessions.

The committee, aided by National Academies staff, conducted litera-
ture  reviews  to  obtain  information  on  the  incidence  and  prevalence  of
autoimmune disease and other factors, such as associated comorbidities.
The committee gave preference to U.S. data when they were appropriately
rigorous and inclusive, but when U.S. data focused on small populations
or lacked rigor, the committee used data from other countries in which
health care systems and registries better enable the collection of data.

Organization of the Report

This report is organized into two parts and seven chapters. Part I: Intro-
duction,  Background  on Autoimmune  Diseases,  Select Autoimmune  Dis-
eases, and Crosscutting Issues (Chapters 1–4) and Part II: NIH Autoimmune
Disease  Research  Efforts  and Analysis  of Autoimmune  Disease  Research
Funding (Chapters 5–7). In addition to this Introduction (Chapter 1), which
provides an overview of the origin, purpose, and organization of the report,
Chapter 2 (Background on Autoimmune Disease) provides information on
how the autoimmune diseases are defined and an overview of the occur-
rence and course of autoimmune diseases. Chapter 3 (Select Autoimmune
Diseases) provides more information specific to the autoimmune diseases
that the committee selected to focus on. The overview in Chapter 3 begins
with a discussion of Sjögren’s disease because the disease illustrates many
of  the  features  and  complexities  common  to  autoimmune  diseases,  some
of which are listed in Box 1-3. After Sjögren’s disease, Chapter 3 discusses
other systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, followed by autoimmune
diseases that affect a specific tissue or organ system, including skin, gas-
trointestinal system, central nervous system, and endocrine system.

Chapter 4 (Crosscutting Issues in Autoimmune Disease) discusses a
number of issues that have implications for autoimmune disease research
activities. Chapter 5 provides an overview of NIH autoimmune disease
research  efforts,  and  Chapter  6  provides  an  analysis  of  funding  for  the
autoimmune  diseases  the  committee  focused  on.  Chapter  7  identifies
opportunities for enhancing autoimmune disease research at NIH.

Background on Autoimmune Diseases

DEFINING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

The immune system comprises cellular, chemical, and soluble protein
components  that  together  protect  the  body  against  foreign  substances,
including  infectious  agents  and  tumor  cells,  while  not  responding  to
molecules that signify “self” (Chaplin, 2010; Marshall et al., 2018). Auto-
immunity arises when the immune system fails to distinguish self from
non-self at the level of specific regions of cell surface molecules, or epi-
topes,  recognized  by  two  of  the  major  effectors  of  the  immune  system:
B cells, which produce antibodies, and T cells.1  Autoimmune disease by
definition, then, is autoimmunity that results over time in a pathological
outcome  with  self-reactive,  or  autoreactive,  T  cells  and  autoantibodies
causing tissue damage (Brent et al., 2007; Johns Hopkins University, 2022;
Rose  and  Bona,  1993;  Rosenblum  et  al.,  2015).  In  1993,  Rose  and  Bona
reevaluated  Witebsky’s  postulates2  defining  autoimmune  disease,  and
proposed  three  levels  of  evidence  to  establish  that  a  human  disease  is
autoimmune  in  origin,  including  direct  evidence  by  transfer  of  disease
with  pathogenic  autoantibody  or  autoreactive  T  cells,  indirect  evidence

1 In recent years, evidence of innate immune mechanisms that recognize and respond to
damage to self-tissues has blurred self/non-self distinctions (Abbas et al., 2004; Rose and
Mackay, 2014).

2 The postulates required that “an autoimmune response be recognized in the form of an
autoantibody or cell-mediated immunity; that the corresponding antigen be identified, and
that an analogous autoimmune response be induced in an experimental animal. Finally, the
immunized animal must also develop a similar disease” (Rose and Bona, 1993).



ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

based  on  reproduction  of  the  autoimmune  disease  in  an  animal  model,
and circumstantial evidence from clinical data (Rose and Bona, 1993).

The terms autoimmunity and autoimmune disease originated in the
1950s, but in 1999 the term “autoinflammatory disease” emerged, which
emphasizes  the  critical  role  of  the  innate  immune  system—the  quickly
reacting,  nonspecific  component  of  the  immune  system—in  chronic
inflammatory diseases where autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells play
less of a role in mediating pathology (Abbas et al., 2004; Brent et al., 2007;
Masters  et  al.,  2009;  Rose  and  Mackay,  2014;  Stoffels  and  Simon,  2014).
Autoinflammatory diseases are broadly considered by the scientific com-
munity to be those conditions driven predominantly by innate immune
cells,  such  as  macrophages,  mediating  systemic  inflammation  and  self-
tissue  pathology,  whereas  autoimmune  diseases  occur  when  adaptive
immune cells—T cells and B cells—targeting self-antigens are the domi-
nant response causing inflammation and tissue damage.

Some diseases are clearly autoinflammatory in nature, such as famil-
ial  Mediterranean  fever,  Behçet’s  disease,  and  Still’s  disease  (Ciccarelli
et  al.,  2014).  Others  are  clearly  autoimmune  disorders,  including  mul-
tiple  sclerosis  and  systemic  lupus  erythematosus  (SLE).  However,  dis-
tinguishing between autoimmune and autoinflammatory disease can be
difficult because activation of the innate immune system is a prerequisite
for  triggering  an  adaptive  immune  response  (Iwasaki  and  Medzhitov,
2015). In fact, for most immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as
atherosclerosis, and prototypical autoimmune diseases such as multiple
sclerosis,  the  innate  and  adaptive  immune  systems  both  play  a  role  in
promoting disease, leading to the notion of a spectrum or continuum of
autoinflammatory-autoimmune diseases (Hedrich, 2016; McGonagle and
McDermott, 2006).

Moreover,  research  is  showing that diseases  that medical  science  has
not  historically  considered  to  be  autoimmune  diseases,  such  as  athero-
sclerosis,  Parkinson’s  disease,  and  cancer,  have  autoimmune mechanisms
such   as   autoantibodies   (de  Jonge   et  al.,   2021)   and   autoreactive  T   and   B
cells  that contribute  to  the  pathogenesis  of  disease  (Ketelhuth and  Hans-
son,  2016;  Lindestam  Arlehamn  et  al.,  2020).  Research  on  Parkinson’s
disease, for example, has revealed that T cell reactivity, which prompts an
attack on brain cells, is associated with early and even preclinical disease
(Lindestam   Arlehamn  et  al.,   2020).   However,   it  is   outside   the   scope   of
this  report  to  consider  all  diseases  that  involve  autoimmune  processes,
and  the  report  focuses  on  diseases  that  have  traditionally  been  termed
autoimmune  diseases,  such  as  multiple  sclerosis  and  SLE.

Similarly there is no consensus regarding the number of autoimmune
diseases. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
website  states  there  are  more  than  80  diseases  (NIAID,  2017),  and  the

BACKGROUND ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES


Autoimmune Registry3 and the Autoimmune Association4 each list around
150 diseases (Autoimmune Association, 2021; Autoimmune Registry Inc.,
2020). The National Institutes of Health’s (NIH’s) 2016–2018 triennial fiscal
report to Congress discusses research applicable to autoimmune diseases
in  general  as  well  as  research  on  specific  diseases,  including  SLE,  mul-
tiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, myasthenia gravis, scleroderma, rheumatoid
arthritis, myositis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis,5  alopecia areata, psoriasis,
pemphigus vulgaris, BACH2-related immunodeficiency and autoimmunity
(BRIDA), and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn’s disease
and ulcerative colitis (NIH, 2016, 2019). The report notes that SLE, multiple
sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, IBD, and rheumatoid arthritis are among the most
common and well-known autoimmune diseases and that BRIDA is a newly
described autoimmune disease.

In  the  medical  and  research  community,  there  are  two  differing
approaches  to  characterize  disease.  One  is  to  characterize  and  name  dis-
eases  according  to  clinical  criteria  such  as  the  presence  of  autoantibodies
for  autoimmune  diseases  (Hargraves  et  al.,  1948;  Marshall  et  al.,  2018).
Today,  medical  science  classifies  many  rheumatologic,  neurologic,  gas-
trointestinal,  cutaneous,  hematologic,  and  cardiopulmonary  illnesses  as
“autoimmune”  based  on  the  presence  of  autoantibodies,  for  example.
The  emphasis  on  clinical  presentations  of  disease  has  resulted  in  disease
classification  by  clinical  diagnosis  and  organ  system. A second  approach
to understanding diseases is to characterize them by their biologic mecha-
nisms—the  pathways  that  cause,  mitigate,  or  affect  the  trajectory  of  dis-
ease. Over the past half century, the science of autoimmunity expanded
beyond  the  concept  of  autoantibodies  and  autoreactive  T  cells  and  led
to  the  emergence  of  the  understanding  of  the  importance  of  the  innate
immune response against self and other components of inflammation as
drivers  of  autoimmune  disease  (Langan  et  al.,  2020).  Studies  of  innate
immune  cells,  cytokines,  cell  surface  markers,  complement,  and  other
biological  phenomena  now  expand  the  definition  of  “autoimmune”  to
include illnesses with shared immunological mechanisms (Anaya, 2012;
Cho and Feldman, 2015; Gokuladhas et al., 2021). Researchers can use an

goarthritis,  polyarthritis,  enthesitis-related  arthritis  (spondyloarthropathy),  and  systemic
arthritis  (Still’s  disease).  Source:  https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10370-

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

understanding of biologic mechanisms to target interventions for preven-
tion, treatment, and cure.

There is no consensus regarding boundaries of the definition of auto-
immune and autoinflammatory diseases. Public stakeholders, including
people living with autoimmune disease, usually do not consider autoim-
mune  and  autoinflammatory  conditions  together,  while  clinicians  and
investigators  may  consider  them  similar  and  common  enough  to  think
of  them  as  one  entity  or  as  two  closely  related  entities.  Regardless,  the
criteria for diagnosing someone as having an autoimmune disease may
include diagnostic or classification criteria that describe clinically identi-
fiable phenotypes in quantitative, exclusionary, time-limited, and binary
terms (American Board of Medical Specialties, n.d.; Jia et al., 2017; Lock-
shin et al., 2021; Thompson et al., 2018). Nonetheless, diagnostic uncer-
tainty is common among patients with autoimmune diseases.

Use of Autoimmune Disease Definitions in Research

Both the clinical criteria and biologic mechanism approaches to dis-
ease  classification  play  a  role  in  research  efforts  to  better  understand
autoimmune disease. Sociological and clinical research studies, including
those that NIH supports, define autoimmune diseases narrowly, requiring
consensus diagnostic and classification criteria. Criteria-defined diagno-
ses are prioritized in medical-specialty training and practice (Aggarwal
et  al.,  2015b; American  Board  of  Medical  Specialties,  n.d.)  as  well  as  in
discourse by patient advocacy groups. However, criteria-based definitions
of autoimmune illnesses exclude individuals who are atypical or who do
not fulfill or are excluded by criteria definitions (Aggarwal et al., 2015b;
Jia et al., 2017).

Biological purposes for using a diagnosis name are to support studies
of mechanisms and/or phenotypes to develop interventions for individu-
als and to improve patient care. For these purposes, diagnosis names do
not necessarily require that an individual fulfill a list of criteria. Indeed,
mechanistic studies often include—and even focus on—atypical individu-
als  whose  slow  illness  evolution  (“pre-disease”),  clinical  heterogeneity,
and overlapping features exclude criteria-based diagnoses (Jia et al., 2017;
Lockshin et al., 2015, 2019). However, clinical research protocols typically
exclude individuals with autoimmune syndromes that do not meet formal
classification or diagnostic criteria. These individuals are also difficult to
identify  in  health  statistics  and  medical  billing  databases.  In  addition,
insurers may refuse to pay for tests and treatments for patients who do
not fulfill criteria (Lockshin et al., 2021; Noah, 2022; Pinson, 2012).

BACKGROUND ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES


Finding: Recent scientific advances regarding cellular and molecular
mechanisms of tissue injury blur the line between autoimmune and
autoinflammatory diseases, making differentiation between the two
difficult.

Finding:  There  is  no  consensus  on  the  number  of  autoimmune
diseases.

Finding:  Physicians  and  clinical  researchers  classify  autoimmune
diseases according to symptoms and laboratory abnormalities; basic
science researchers classify autoimmune diseases according to more
inclusive  biological  mechanisms.  Lack  of  a  consensus  vocabulary
impedes optimal research design and patient care.

Conclusion: To improve research, guide patient care, and coordinate com­
munication, clinical and research communities should develop a consensus
vocabulary  that  includes  both  clinically  defined  autoimmune  diseases  and
autoimmune mechanisms.

Causes of Autoimmune Diseases

Autoimmune diseases may have a known genetic or environmental
cause  or  varying  degree  of  both.  When  its  etiology  is  unknown,  an  ill-
ness  with  an  identifiable  clinical  or  biologic  phenotype  is  considered
“idiopathic.”  When  an  illness  has  a  known  exogenous  cause,  such  as  a
bacterium  or  toxin,  the  disease  is  classified  as  having  been  induced  by
the  exogenous  agent  (Bastard  et  al.,  2020;  Woodruff  et  al.,  2021).  Exam-
ples of exogenously induced autoimmune disease include procainamide-
induced lupus (Blomgren et al., 1972), gadolinium-induced scleroderma
(Idée et al., 2014), and various autoimmune phenomena, especially lung
and gastrointestinal disease induced by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
T-cell CD19/CD3 (Sedykh et al., 2018), anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody
(Suntharalingam  et  al.,  2006),  and  checkpoint-inhibitor  (Johnson  et  al.,
2018) treatments for malignancies. As highlighted by the COVID-19 pan-
demic, infections can play a role in inducing or exacerbating SLE (Quaglia
et  al.,  2021)  and  cause  other  autoimmune  diseases  such  as  myocarditis
(Boehmer  et  al.,  2021).  Environmental  toxicants  can  also  cause  autoim-
mune disease illnesses such as Spanish toxic oil syndrome (Gelpí et al.,
2002),  eosinophilic  fasciitis  triggered  by  L-tryptophan  ingestion  (Beko
et  al.,  1993),  post-9/11  sarcoidosis-like  syndrome  (Webber  et  al.,  2017),
and myositis-like and scleroderma syndromes found in gold miners and
workers in the polyvinyl chloride industry (Haynes and Gershwin, 1982;
Tager and Tikly, 1999).

Sex Differences in Autoimmune Diseases

Most autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in women than men,
with  conservative  estimates attributing  greater  than  75  percent  of  auto-
immune  disease  incidence  to  women  (Desai  and  Brinton,  2019;  Jacob-
son  et  al.,  1997;  Rubtsov  et  al.,  2010). Among  the  exceptions  are  type  1
diabetes  mellitus  (Cartee  et  al.,  2016)  and  myocarditis  (Coronado  et  al.,
2019; Fairweather et al., 2013), which occur more often in boys or men.
Research suggests that sex and steroid hormones may contribute to these
sex-related disparities. Sex hormones, both natural and synthetic, directly
interact with cells of the immune system through receptors located on or
inside immune cells (Bouman et al., 2005; Buskiewicz et al., 2016; Edwards
et al., 2020). Steroid hormones, including estrogens and androgen, affect
antibody production and immune cell proliferation and in this way can
increase or inhibit immune response (Buskiewicz et al., 2016; Fairweather,
2014). In women, for example, estrogen is known to cause B cells to pro-
duce a greater antibody and autoantibody response compared with men
(Potluri et al., 2019), while men can develop more severe inflammation in
response to estrogen (Maggio et al., 2009; Tengstrand et al., 2003). Sources
of hormones include external sources such as diet (e.g., soy), drugs (e.g.,
birth  control  pills),  and  skin  care  products,  as  well  as  the  body,  which
produces  steroids  (Fairweather,  2014;  Martin-Pozo  et  al.,  2021;  Patisaul,
2017). There is great research interest in understanding how sex hormones
regulate the immune response.

Endocrine-disrupting  chemicals  such  as  phenols,  parabens,  and
phthalates may influence sex differences in autoimmune diseases by alter-
ing sex hormone levels and/or ratios (Bruno et al., 2019; Castro-Correia
et  al.,  2018;  Edwards  et  al.,  2018;  Popescu  et  al.,  2021).  In  addition,  the
X chromosome encodes many immune system genes, and dysregulated
X-inactivation  may  contribute  to  sex  differences  in  autoimmune  dis-
eases (Yuen, 2020). Much of our understanding of sex differences and the
immune response during autoimmune disease is based on studies using
animal models. In terms of prevalence and severity of disease, many ani-
mal models demonstrate a sex bias that is similar to that seen in human
autoimmune diseases (Coronado et al., 2019; Nusbaum et al., 2020; Rus-
man et al., 2018).

There is a semantic issue associated with sex and gender that is rel-
evant  to  this  research.  The  term  sex  generally  refers  to  biological  sex
differences  between  males  and  females—chromosomes,  hormones,  and
reproductive  organs,  for  example—that  affect  health  (Springer  et  al.,
2012), while gender refers to the differences in socially constructed roles,
characteristics, and behaviors of women and men (Springer et al., 2012;
WHO, 2021). Separating the two constructs can be difficult, but labeling
differences that occur in human research as “gender differences” rather
than sex differences is not accurate either (Morgan et al., 2021). Given the

BACKGROUND ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES


committee’s  focus  on  the  effect  of  sex  hormones  and  sex  chromosomes
on  inflammation  in  relation  to  autoimmune  disease  pathogenesis,  the
committee  chose  to  assume  that  most  of  the  studies  cited  in  this  report
involve biological sex differences. However, most of the source data did
not  distinguish  between  sex  and  gender  differences  when  collecting  or
analyzing the data. The lack of clinical and animal studies that carefully
define  sex  and  gender  in  study  design  and  that  disaggregate  data  and
conduct  their  analysis  accordingly,  rather  than  only  controlling  for  sex,
is a major gap in the field that future research might address. In fact, the
research community has advocated for disaggregating data and analyses
by sex and gender (Gebhard et al., 2020; Morgan et al., 2021).

Finding: Regarding research design, there is clinical research in which
sex and gender have not been defined carefully and animal research
in which sex has not been defined, thus preventing the disaggregation
and analysis of data on autoimmune disease from being conducted
accurately.

Changing Definitions of Autoimmune Disease

Biological  mechanisms  are  defining  characteristics  of  autoimmune
disease  as  they  reflect  poorly  regulated  function  of  one  or  many  parts
of  inflammation  pathways,  such  as  antibodies/autoantibodies;  macro-
phages, eosinophils, and T and B cells; cytokines; genes and gene expres-
sion;  microbiome;  detoxification  pathways;  and  altered  endothelium,
mucosa,  blood–brain,  and  placenta  barrier  tissue  functions.  For  idio-
pathic, exogenously induced, and genetic forms of autoimmune diseases,
the faulty mechanisms may operate independently, simultaneously, or in
concert.

Although  this  report  focuses  on  specific  “idiopathic”  autoimmune
disease diagnoses, changing definitional boundaries of the diagnoses, dif-
ferent purposes of using diagnosis names, new data defining mechanisms
in  exogenously  induced  or  genetic  diseases,  and  new  ways  of  thinking
about disease mechanisms guarantee that, in the near future, there will
be  a  need  to  restructure  the  concept  of  autoimmune  disease.  Scientific
advances in genetics and epigenetics, for example, have helped to better
distinguish  illnesses  with  phenotypic  characteristics  or  features  seen  in
autoimmune diseases, such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and vacuoles-
E1  enzyme-X-linked-autoinflammatory  (VEXAS)  syndrome  (Beck  et  al.,
2020; Crow and Rehwinkel, 2009) from autoimmune disease.

In  summary,  issues  that  make  the  committee’s  work  difficult  in
responding to its charge are inherent in the concept of autoimmune dis-
ease: there are no standard definitions of either autoimmunity or autoim-
mune  disease,  the  diseases  are  heterogeneous,  and  they  last  extended


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

periods of time. Moreover, some stakeholders conceptualize autoimmune
diseases according to clinical criteria, while other stakeholders consider
them to be biological entities with overlapping borders.

OCCURRENCE AND COURSE OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

Data Sources and Limitations

Two commonly used measures to calculate the occurrence of a disease
are  incidence  and  prevalence.  Incidence  refers  to  the  frequency  of  new
occurrence in a population in a specified period of time—for example, the
number of people newly diagnosed with a disease per year expressed as
annual new cases per 100,000 persons (Porta, 2014). Prevalence refers to
the total number of people with a disease in a defined time period, and it
can include people recently diagnosed as well.

Incidence and prevalence data for autoimmune diseases in the United
States  are  limited  and  can  be  difficult  to  find.  There  is  no  mandatory
reporting system or national registry for autoimmune diseases. Much of
the  available  incidence  and  prevalence  data  come  from  countries  other
than the United States with health care systems covering the entire popu-
lation (Eriksson et al., 2013; Munk Nielsen et al., 2019; Pasvol et al., 2020;
Wei et al., 2018).

For   the   purpose   of   this   report,   the   committee   sought  high-quality
epidemiology data,  using criteria  encompassing the  size  and  diversity of
the  population  studied  and  the  ability to  examine  potential  differences  in
disease  rates  across  segments  of  the  population,  the  length  and  recency
of the time period covered, and the inclusion of a validation procedure to
assess  the  accuracy of   the   classification   criteria   used   to   identify specific
diseases  within  the  database  being used  in  the  study.  The  committee  pre-
ferred  studies  from  the  past decade  (i.e.,  studies  for  which  the  data  collec-
tion  period  included  years  since  2010),  but such studies  were  unavailable
for most of the autoimmune diseases selected for this report. The commit-
tee  did  not consider  general  population studies  using self-reported  data
that did not include a medical  record  review for  estimates of incidence or
prevalence  of  autoimmune  diseases  because  the  accuracy of  these  meth-
ods  is  either  unknown  or  poor (Videm  et al.,  2017).

Although the committee found data sources meeting  some of these
criteria  for  all  of  the  selected  diseases,  none  met  all  of  the  criteria.  The
most robust data come from studies of SLE, type 1 diabetes, and multiple
sclerosis, described below:


	 Data  for  primary  Sjögren’s  disease  were  available  from  Man-
hattan,  New  York,  through  the  Manhattan  Lupus  Surveillance

BACKGROUND ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES


Program  (2007  to  2009)  (Izmirly et al.,  2019).  Because  this  effort
was for a limited time period, this study does not provide data
that  allow   assessing  temporal  trends   in  the   incidence   or  preva-
lence  of  Sjögren’s  disease.  These  data  focus  only  on  Sjögren’s
disease  (referred  to  as  primary  Sjögren’s  disease)  and  do  not
include  individuals  with  Sjögren’s  disease  along with  other  sys-
temic  rheumatic  diseases  such as  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  SLE.
Sjögren’s  disease  is  diagnosed  in  up to  30  percent of  individuals
with  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  up  to  20  percent  of  individuals
with SLE  (Aggarwal  et al.,  2015a;  Baer  et al.,  2010;  Harrold  et al.,
2020).  These  rates   of  Sjögren’s   disease  co-occurrence,  together
with  the   prevalence   of   rheumatoid   arthritis   and   SLE   in  Table
2-1,  suggest that Sjögren’s  disease  may occur more  than  20  times
more  frequently when  co-occurring with  other autoimmune  dis-
eases  than  when  diagnosed  alone.  Thus,  the  prevalence  rate  data
limited  to  primary Sjögren’s  disease  exclude  the  majority of  indi-
viduals  with  Sjögren’s  disease.
For  SLE,  incidence  and  prevalence  data  from  the  early  2000s
(2002  to  2004  or  2007  to  2009)  are  available  from  a  network  of
population-based national lupus registries in Michigan (Somers
et al., 2014); Georgia (Lim et al., 2014); California (Dall’Era et al.,
2017); Manhattan, New York (Izmirly et al., 2017); and American
Indian  or  Alaskan  Native  populations  (Izmirly  et  al.,  2021a,b).
Because this effort occurred for a limited time period, it does not
provide data allowing for assessing temporal trends in the inci-
dence or prevalence of SLE. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) supported these studies.


•	 	 For antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), incidence data from 2001
to  2015  are  available  from  the  Rochester  Epidemiology  Project
(Duarte-Garcia  et  al.,  2019);  these  data  were  used  to  estimate
prevalence in 2015. The population base for this study is relatively
small and homogenous. Because of the high proportion of people
with SLE who also have APS, the relative lack of representation
of groups who are at higher risk for SLE in this study population
would result in an underestimation of APS rates.
For  rheumatoid  arthritis  (Kawatkar  et  al.,  2019),  incidence  and
prevalence data from 2005 to 2014 are available from the Kaiser
Permanente medical system of Southern California, which covers
a large and diverse population with respect to sociodemographic
characteristics.

•	  For psoriasis, prevalence data from 1996 to 2009 from the Kaiser
Permanente  medical  system  of  Northern  California  was  used
(Asgari et al., 2013).



ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE



•	  For  IBD,  prevalence  data  are  available  for  1999  to  2001  from
a  study  using  a  large  database  from  nine  health  maintenance
organizations  (Herrinton  et  al.,  2007).  For  more  recent  preva-
lence  data,  studies  include  a  2007  to  2016  study  that  used  two
private  administrative  health  claims  databases  collectively  cov-
ering approximately 62  million  people  annually (Ye  et al.,  2020),
as  well  as  studies  in  more  limited  populations  (Hou  et al.,  2013;
Shivashankar et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2021). The committee relied  on
the estimates  of the larger study, while considering the variability
in estimates and the strengths and limitations of this set of studies
(see  Box 2-1).
For   celiac   disease,   serology  (tissue   transglutaminase   and   endo-
mysial  IgA  antibodies)  data  from  the  2009  to  2012  National  Health
and  Nutrition  Examination Survey6  are  available  (Mardini  et al.,
2015).   Although  this   study  provides   data   on   the   prevalence   of
these  antibodies  in  a  representative  sample  of  the  U.S.  popula-
tion,  it does  not include  symptom  data  or  other  details  allowing
for  assessing disease  status  based  on  a  full  clinical evaluation.
For  primary biliary cholangitis  (PBC),  prevalence data  from  2003
to  2014  are  available  from  the  Fibrotic  Liver  Disease  Consortium
(Lu  et al.,  2018),  a  large  network of  health  care  systems  drawing
patients  from  across  the  United  States.

•	  For  multiple  sclerosis,  prevalence  data  from  2008  to  2010  are
available  from  a  study using three  public  (Veterans  Administra-
tion,   Medicare,   and   Medicaid)  and   three   private   administrative
health  claims   databases   collectively  covering  125  million  U.S.
adults   (Culpepper   et  al.,   2019;   Nelson   et  al.,   2019;   Wallin   et  al.,
2019).  The  data  were  weighted  to  reflect the  source  of  insurance
coverage  in  the  U.S.  population,  and  the  study used  a  validation
procedure  to  assess  the  sensitivity and  specificity of  the  classifi-
cation   criteria.   However,   the   design   of   this   study  did   not  allow
for  assessing incidence  rates  or  differences  in  prevalence  among
racial  or  ethnic  groups,  or  assessment of  temporal  trends  in  inci-
dence  or  prevalence.  The  National  Multiple  Sclerosis  Society initi-
ated  and  supported  this  study.

•	  For type 1 diabetes, incidence data from 2002 to 2012 and preva-
lence  data  from  2001  to  2009  are  available  from  the  SEARCH  for
Diabetes  in  Youth  study,  a  large  population-based  study  con-
ducted   at  five   centers   across   the   United   States   (Dabelea   et  al.,

2014;  Mayer-Davis  et  al.,  2017).  CDC  and  the  National  Institute
of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases initiated and sup-
ported this study.

•  The  committee  did  not find  any recent (year  2000  or  later)  studies
of incidence or prevalence of autoimmune thyroid diseases in the
United  States.

In contrast, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
database (NCI, 2021b) developed by the National Cancer Institute, pro-
vides easily accessible, verified data on incidence, prevalence, and mortal-
ity rates for the U.S. population in total, for males, females, as well as for
five race and ethnicity groups, for all cancers, and for more than 30 indi-
vidual types of cancers. It also provides trends in these rates over the past
20 years. This kind of resource is not available for autoimmune diseases.
The committee did take special note of the usefulness of the Olmsted
County,  Minnesota,  Rochester  Epidemiology  Project  (St.  Sauver  et  al.,
2011) conducted by the Mayo Clinic. This resource has provided epide-
miologic data for rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, IBD, and many other autoim-
mune (and other) diseases since the 1960s, and is one of the few sources
of long-term data on trends in the occurrence of these diseases. It is also
a resource used for studies of prognosis, concomitant illnesses, and auto-
immune-related mechanisms in other diseases. An important limitation,
however, is that it covers a relatively small and homogenous population
in terms of sociodemographic background,7  and the sample size is small
for many of these diseases. NIH continues to support the Rochester Epi-
demiology Project.

Finding: There is no mandatory reporting system or national popula-
tion-based data-collection program for autoimmune diseases, as there
is for cancer through the National Cancer Institute’s SEER system.

There are also difficulties with respect to obtaining accurate data on
mortality relating to autoimmune diseases. Death certificates can provide
population-level data on mortality from autoimmune diseases, but they
are not a good source of data pertaining to occurrence of chronic condi-
tions  that  are  not  associated  with  acute  mortality  risks,  such  as  most
autoimmune diseases. Death certificates include information on immedi-
ate and underlying causes of death, with an additional field for other sig-
nificant conditions contributing to the death. However, the completeness

7 U.S. census data for Olmsted County, Minnesota, in 2000 reported a population size of
124,277  with  90.3  percent  of  residents  identifying  as  White  and  6.4  of  residents  reporting
incomes below the poverty level (Rochester Epidemiology Project, 2012).

Variation in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Estimates

The  difficulty  in  finding  basic,  up-to-date,  accurate  data  on  the  occurrence  of
autoimmune  diseases  can  be  illustrated  by  the  IBD  ulcerative  colitis,  and  Crohn’s
disease. Extensive search for data on the U.S. prevalence of these diseases yielded
six studies with varying strengths that produce estimates for the prevalence in 2020
that range from 1.2 to almost 4.0 million.

As with many other autoimmune diseases, these estimates do not include undiag­

nosed disease in people with mild symptoms.

1.	  One study provides estimates for IBD, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease from
2007 to 2016 based on two health insurance claims databases encompassing
approximately  62  million  lives  annually  (Ye  et  al.,  2020).  Extrapolating  to  the
2020 U.S. population yields an estimated 1.2 million people with ulcerative colitis,
Crohn’s disease, or unspecified IBD. The claims data come from private insur­
ance companies, limiting the generalizability of the results. Investigators validated
the algorithm within the Canadian health care system. The study does not provide
a  basis  for  examining  differences  in  rates  by  racial,  ethnic,  or  socioeconomic
factors, but it does allow for the examination of changes in rates over this time
period.

2.  Another  group  derived  its  IBD  prevalence  estimates  from  1999  to  2001  from
a database of 1.8 million members of nine health maintenance organizations
(Herrinton et al., 2007). This study included a validation protocol using medical
records from the database. These are the oldest data among the studies the
committee  examined,  however,  and  so  would  not  account  for  any  increases
in prevalence over the past 20 years. The study also does not provide a basis
for  examining  differences  in  rates  by  racial,  ethnic,  or  socioeconomic  factors.
Extrapolating to the 2020 U.S. populations produces an estimated 1.3 million
people with ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, or unspecified IBD.

and accuracy of this assessment, particularly for deaths relating to auto-
immune diseases, is low: studies have demonstrated considerable under-
reporting of autoimmune diseases as a cause of death, with no mention of
an underlying condition in 40 to 80 percent of deaths of people enrolled in
clinical cohort studies of SLE and rheumatoid arthritis (Calvo-Alén et al.,
2005; Molina et al., 2015). It may be difficult to quantify mortality in most
autoimmune diseases since death more commonly results from—and is
recorded  as  being  the  result  of—complications  such  as  cardiovascular
disease, infection, or malignancy rather than specific disease causes such
as  lethal  hemorrhage  resulting  from  thrombocytopenia.  Studies  of  the
age at death of persons with diagnosed autoimmune diseases constitute
an  indirect  measure  of  mortality. A recent  Dutch  study  that  used  death

3.	  Relatively  recent  (2011)  estimates  of  incidence  and  prevalence  of  IBD  are  based
on  data  from  Olmsted  County,   Minnesota  (Shivashankar  et  al.,  2017).  The   au
thors noted the rates in this study were among the highest reported in the United
States.   Extrapolating   to   the   2020   U.S.   population   produces   an   estimated   1.7
million  people  with  ulcerative  colitis  or  Crohn’s  disease.  This  study  likely  overes
timates disease prevalence when extrapolating to the entire U.S. population be
cause the study population was predominantly White and rates of these diseases
are considerably higher in White persons compared with other groups.

4.	  Extrapolating  from  a study in a national Veterans Affairs health service population
conducted  between  1998  and  2009  (Hou  et  al.,  2013)  to  the  2020  U.S.  population
yields an estimate for the prevalence of IBD at 2.3 million. Although this is a
national database, it is a selected population (i.e., veterans). The denominator
for the rate calculations is the number of people who used health care services,
rather than all people in the study population, which may result in an overesti
mate of the rate of disease.

5.	  One study provides estimates based on Medicare data for about 25 million ben
eficiaries   in   patients   aged   67   and   older   not   enrolled   in   a   health   maintenance
organization  (Xu  et  al.,  2021).  It  is  not  possible  to  extrapolate  estimates  from  this
age group to the entire U.S. population.

6.	  A   representative   sample   of   the   U.S.   population   based   on   the   2015   National
Health  Interview  Survey  provides  prevalence  estimates  (Dahlhamer  et  al.,  2016).
Extrapolating  to  the  2020  U.S.  population  yields  an  estimated  3.9  million  people.
This  study  is  based  on  self-report  (“Have  you  ever  been  told  by  a  doctor  or
other  health  professional  that  you  had  Crohn’s  disease  or  ulcerative  colitis?”)  in
a   general   population   setting,   with   no   verification   from   medical   records   and   no
information on the accuracy of responses. As noted previously, the committee did
not  consider  studies  using self-reported data, without medical record review.

certificate  data  concluded  that  “Systemic  autoimmune  diseases  consti-
tute a rare group of causes of death, but contribute to mortality through
multiple comorbidities. Classification systems could be adapted to better
encompass these diseases as a category” (Mitratza et al., 2021).

The committee also noted challenges in conducting and interpreting
some  clinic-based  studies  of  mortality  risk  among  people  with  specific
autoimmune diseases. For example, studies based in tertiary care center(s)
limit the generalizability of the findings. It is also important to distinguish
between incidence and prevalence in analysis of risk over time, to report
absolute risk in addition to relative risk, to address loss to follow-up, and
to include a sample large enough to be able to examine the experiences of
specific sociodemographic groups within the patient population.


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Finding: There is a lack of accurate data on mortality associated with
autoimmune  diseases.  Death  certificates  may  provide  incomplete
information on an underlying autoimmune disease that contributed
to the cause of death.

Additional Data Challenges

Studies  using International  Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD)  9  or  ICD
10 codes in electronic medical records to identify potential cases of auto-
immune   diseases   may  be   inadequate   (Moores   and   Sathe,   2013).   Other
information, such as number of visits with specific codes, medication use,
and  results  of  specific  types  of  laboratory tests  can  improve  the  accuracy
of  the  case  ascertainment methods  (Barnado  et al.,  2017;  Liao  et al.,  2010).
Researchers can conduct a complete medical record review to evaluate a
case  ascertainment algorithm’s  sensitivity and  specificity within  the  data-
base  being used  (Carroll et al.,  2012).  Insurance-based  algorithms  used  in
the U  nited S  tates p  resent an a  dditional d
rms o  f d  etermining
initial  diagnosis  for  incidence  studies,  as  medical  records  may be incom-
plete  because  of  changes  in  coverage  or  providers.  The  pattern  of  remis-
sions   and   flares   seen   in   some   autoimmune   diseases   presents   additional
challenges   to   determining  disease   prevalence.   Prevalence   studies   based
on  current medication use  or  a  specified  frequency of  medical  visits  may
undercount patients  experiencing prolonged  periods  of  remission.

Estimates of Overall Prevalence of Autoimmune Diseases

In 1997, a compilation and analysis of studies reporting incidence or
prevalence data for diseases estimated that at least one autoimmune dis-
ease would occur in approximately 8.5 million U.S. residents, or 3.2 per-
cent of the population (Jacobson et al., 1997). This was the first attempt to
estimate the overall burden of autoimmune diseases as a class of diseases,
and  it  used  a  literature-survey  approach,  collecting  studies  published
since  1965.  A subsequent  analysis  building  on  this  work  expanded  the
number of autoimmune diseases to 31, used country-specific (Denmark)
hospitalization data to better estimate more current disease patterns, and
accounted for co-occurrence of diseases, resulting in an estimate of overall
prevalence of greater than 5 percent (Eaton et al., 2007). This analysis may
underestimate diseases that generally do not require hospitalizations or
clinic  visits  in  a  specific  time  period.  For  example,  prevalence  rates  for
alopecia,  psoriasis,  and  hypothyroidism  were  three  to  five  times  lower
in  this  study  compared  with  other  studies  from  European  populations.
Accounting for this deficiency resulted in an overall estimate of 7.6 to 9.4
percent for a set of 29 autoimmune diseases (Cooper et al., 2009).

BACKGROUND ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES


These estimates are all based on the prevalence of autoimmune dis-
eases,  rather  than  the  prevalence  of  people  with  autoimmune  diseases.
Because many people have more than one autoimmune disease, the num-
ber of people with any autoimmune disease is less than the number sug-
gested by summing the prevalence of individual autoimmune diseases.
The sum of the prevalence of individual diseases will be larger than the
sum  of  individuals  with  any  autoimmune  disease,  with  the  difference
reflecting  the  degree  of  over-counting  resulting  from  multiple  diseases
occurring  within  an  individual.  A study  in  seven  provinces  in  Canada
estimated  the  combined  prevalence  of  systemic  autoimmune  rheumatic
disease (SLE, scleroderma, primary Sjögren’s disease, and polymyositis/
dermatomyositis)  and  counted  individuals  with  one  or  more  of  these
diseases. The estimated prevalence of this group of diseases was 200 to
500 per 100,000 (Broten et al., 2014). This is likely a low estimate for the
systemic rheumatic diseases, given the low sensitivity of the disease clas-
sification algorithms used and the exclusion of rheumatoid arthritis from
this analysis.

Another  way  to   estimate   total   burden   of   a   group  of   diseases   is   by
cumulative   incidence   or   lifetime   risk.   For   example,   the   estimate   of   the
lifetime  risk of  all cancers  combined,  based  on 2016 to  2018  SEER  data  was
39.2 percent (NCI, 2021a), with individual risks for colon, lung, and breast
cancer  each  being greater  than 4  percent.  In  an analysis  of  lifetime  risk of
systemic  rheumatic  diseases  (rheumatoid  arthritis,  SLE,  psoriatic  arthri-
tis,   polymyalgia   rheumatica,   giant  cell   arteritis,   ankylosing  spondylitis,
primary  Sjögren’s   disease)   in   Olmsted   County,   Minnesota,   the   lifetime
risk was  8.42  percent in  women and  5.13  percent in men  (Crowson et al.,
2011).  Notably,  this  analysis  does  not include  multiple  sclerosis,  thyroid
diseases,  type  1  diabetes,  or  other  autoimmune  diseases,  which  would
most likely increase  these  estimates  several  fold.

Epidemiology of Select Autoimmune Diseases

Prevalence Rates

Among  the  most  common  autoimmune  diseases  are  celiac  disease,
rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis, with prevalence rates approximately
790  to  939  per  100,000  and  approximately  2.3  to  2.5  million  U.S.  resi-
dents  living  with  each  of  these  diseases;  IBD,  with  a  prevalence  rate  of
approximately 500 per 100,000; multiple sclerosis, with a prevalence rate
of approximately 300 per 100,000; and type 1 diabetes, with a prevalence
rate  of  approximately  190  per  100,000  (Table  2-1).  The  available  data
pertaining to Sjögren’s disease are limited to primary Sjögren’s disease,


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

which  does  not  occur  in  conjunction  with  SLE,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  or
scleroderma, and so underestimates the overall burden of this condition.
Table 2-1 does not include the autoimmune thyroid diseases Graves’
disease (hyperthyroidism) and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (hypothyroidism)
because  of  a  lack  of  U.S.  data  covering  the  past  20  years.  A  study  of
Graves’ disease from 2008 to 2013 in Sheffield, United Kingdom, reported
an annual incidence of 24.8 cases per 100,000 persons, with a median age
at  diagnosis  of  44  (33  to  56)  years;  80  percent  of  patients  were  women
(Hussain et al., 2017). A large cohort study from the Netherlands exam-
ined thyroid medication use and thyroid hormone levels to classify overt
and subclinical thyroid diseases; 3.1 percent of participants reported levo-
thyroxine use, and 9.4 percent of the people who were not taking thyroid
medications  had  subclinical  hypothyroidism  (thyroid  stimulating  hor-
mone  levels  of  4.01–10.0  milli-International  Units  per  liter)  (Wouters  et
al., 2020).

Trends in Incidence and Prevalence

Trends in disease incidence are important indicators of changes in the
underlying risk factors for the disease, such as an increasing or decreasing
level of an environmental exposure that contributes to the development of
the disease. These rates can best be ascertained from studies applying the
same case ascertainment methods over time within a specific population.
Trend data from U.S. studies spanning periods within the past 20 years and
meeting  these  criteria  were  not  available  for  psoriasis,  multiple  sclerosis,
or the autoimmune thyroid diseases; for psoriasis and multiple sclerosis,
the committee has included data from Canada in the following summary.
Only one study, of psoriasis incidence in Ontario, Canada, reported
decreasing incidence for time periods covering 2000 to 2015 (Table 2-2).
Studies of Sjögren’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, PBC, and in some stud-
ies  of  IBD  (ulcerative  colitis  and  Crohn’s  disease)  and  type  1  diabetes,
found increasing incidence rates compared with pre-2000 years or during
the 2000s. There was little or no trend observed in the studies of APS and
multiple sclerosis.

Trends in disease prevalence can reflect changes in the incidence of
disease, in the age distribution of a population, or in survival of people
with the disease. Multiple sclerosis (Rotstein et al., 2018) and PBC (Lu et
al., 2018) are examples of diseases for which studies have demonstrated
that  prevalence  increased  despite  little  change  in  incidence;  reductions
in mortality rates were also observed among people with these diseases.
In children and adolescents, the incidence or prevalence of two of the
most common autoimmune diseases, IBD and type 1 diabetes, appears to
have increased in the United States since 2000 (Table 2-2). The pediatric

a  U.S. total population estimates for Sjögren’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and primary biliary cholangitis were calculated by apply-
ing total prevalence rate to 2020 U.S. census population estimates (330  million all ages; 270 million age ≥ 18; 297  million > age 5; 92.4  million <
age 20). The SLE estimate was calculated by extrapolating the estimate from (Izmirly et al., 2021b) based on 2018 U.S. census data to 2020 using
the percentage increase in  total  population  from 2018  to 2020. The APS estimate was calculated by extrapolating  the 2015  estimate provided by
(Duarte-Garcia et al., 2019) to 2020 U.S. census population estimates. Inflammatory bowel disease estimates were calculated by extrapolating the
2016 estimates provided by (Ye et al., 2020) to 2020 U.S. census population estimates. The multiple sclerosis estimate was calculated by extrapolat-
ing the 2010 estimate provided by (Wallin et al., 2019) to 2020 U.S. census population estimates.

b Sjögren’s disease commonly co-occurs with other  systemic rheumatic diseases  (including up  to 30% of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis
and up to 20% of individuals with SLE (Aggarwal et al., 2015a; Baer et al., 2010; Harrold et al., 2020)), but this was not included in the studies of
primary Sjögren’s disease. If these individuals are included, prevalence of all Sjögren’s disease would be estimated to be on the order of 800,000 in
the United States in 2020. However, this figure does not account for individuals with Sjögren’s disease and other systemic autoimmune diseases
(e.g., dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis) or for children.

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

prevalence  of  IBD  in  the  United  States  increased  between  2007  to  2016
from 33.0 to 77.0 per 100,000, with Crohn’s disease being twice as preva-
lent as ulcerative colitis (45.9 versus 21.6) (Ye et al., 2020). Type 1 diabe-
tes has also increased. From 2001 to 2009, a large U.S. study showed an
increase  in  type  1  diabetes  prevalence  from  148  per  100,000  to  193  per
100,000  (Dabelea  et  al.,  2014). A subsequent  study  of  the  U.S.  Medicaid
pediatric population during the period 2002 to 2016 showed an increase
in annual type 1 diabetes prevalence from 129 to 234 per 100,000 (Chen et
al., 2019). This trend was not seen, however, in a study spanning 1994 to
2010 in Olmsted County, Minnesota (Cartee et al., 2016).

Demographic Patterns with Respect to Disease Risks

Many, but not all, autoimmune diseases affect women predominantly
(Figure 2-1). The diseases with the most marked sex difference in occur-
rence, with female-to-male ratios greater than 5:1 are SLE (Izmirly et al.,

between  4:1  and  2:1,  for  multiple  sclerosis  (Langer-Gould  et  al.,  2013),
PBC (Lu et al., 2018), systemic sclerosis (Mayes et al., 2003), and rheuma-
toid arthritis (Myasoedova et al., 2010). However, for other autoimmune
diseases, such as psoriasis (Icen et al., 2009), the female-to-male incidence
ratio is close to or less than 1.0 and also influenced by age. Myocarditis,
for example, occurs more frequently in males before age 50 (Coronado et
al., 2019). Although the female-to-male ratio for APS is close to 1.0 in the
only  population-based  study  available  (Duarte-Garcia  et  al.,  2019),  this
ratio may be higher in populations that include a greater proportion of
patients with SLE.

Regarding disease incidence in children, one study of juvenile idio-
pathic arthritis found an increased incidence in females compared with
males in each of the age groups studied (ages 0 to 5, 6 to 10, and 11 to 15
years) (Harrold et al., 2013). Other autoimmune diseases do not show a
female predominance in children, and some diseases, such as type 1 dia-
betes (Cartee et al., 2016), occur more frequently in boys than girls.

Although  most  autoimmune  diseases  can  occur  at  any  age,  differ-
ent  diseases  present  different  patterns  with  respect  to  age  at  onset  or
diagnosis.  Figure  2-2  shows  four  patterns,  all  based  on  recent  studies
from  Olmsted  County,  Minnesota.  Type  1  diabetes  most  often  occurred
between 5 and 15 years of age, but incidence extended through ages 30
to 39, and rates were higher for males compared with females beginning
around  age  10.  Incidence  rates  for  primary  Sjögren’s  disease  increased
steadily  throughout  adulthood,  reaching  the  highest  rates  around  ages
65 to 74, with higher incidence seen in women (Maciel et al., 2017a). The
peak age at diagnosis of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis was 20 to
29 years, but the study also saw new cases through early and late adult-
hood. There was little difference in rates between males and females for
Crohn’s disease, but for ulcerative colitis, rates in males were somewhat
higher than in females.

Health Disparities in Autoimmune Diseases

There are known disparities in the incidence, prevalence, severity, prog-
nosis, outcomes, and care related to autoimmune diseases. These disparities
adversely affect groups that are socially disadvantaged and marginalized
based on race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic region. In
addition, these factors may interact with one another to cause, accentuate,
and perpetuate health disparities at the individual patient, community, and
societal levels (Reifsnider et al., 2005). While studies may report race and eth-
nicity as a biologic proxy for genetic origin, the committee acknowledges

that  the  terms  “race”  and  “ethnicity”  denote  the  full  breadth  of  experi-
ences and exposures of a population, rather than a limited lens focused on
genetic variability among populations (see Box 2-2).

With respect to racial and ethnic disparities in incidence or prevalence
of disease, it is important to note that no single pattern describes the pat-
terns seen among the autoimmune diseases; for some diseases, the highest
rates occur among Black individuals, while for other diseases, the high-
est  rates  occur  in  White  individuals  (Figure  2-3).  Studies  have  reported
increased rates of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, autoimmune liver disease,
and SLE in Indigenous peoples in the United States and Canada (Barnabe
et al., 2012; Mauldin et al., 2004; Yoshida et al., 2006). These studies rein-
force the need for more directed research into autoimmune disease risk
in American Indian and Alaska Native populations.

Studies have also found disparities in the severity and prognosis of
many diseases according to race and ethnicity (Barton et al., 2011; Lim et
al.,  2019;  Ventura  et  al.,  2017).  Barriers  to  diagnosis,  access  to  specialist
care or to enrollment in clinical trials, and affordability of treatments are
all issues that can affect people with autoimmune diseases (Bailey et al.,

BOX 2-2

The Constructs of Race and Ethnicity

Race and ethnicity have historically been characterized as biological variables.
However,  these  categorizations  represent  social  constructs  that  are  not  synony­
mous with genetics or ancestry. Studies have shown that genetic variation con­
tributes to only a small portion of differences among racial and ethnic groups, and
that self-reported race or ethnicity often do not align with ancestry demonstrated
by genetic data (Mersha and Abebe, 2015; Sankar et al., 2004).

The social construct of race and ethnicity represents the lived experience of
individuals  in  those  groups.  For  individuals  in  racial  and  ethnic  groups  that  are
marginalized, this experience may involve discrimination as a result of structural
racism (Bailey et al., 2021).

Emerging data show an association between psychological stress and biologi­
cal changes, including epigenetic changes that predispose to chronic inflammation
and the development of autoimmune diseases (Fagundes et al., 2013; Miller et al.,
2011).  For  example,  stress  that  resulted  from  exposure  to  systemic  racism  was
shown to be associated with greater disease activity and organ damage in Black
women with SLE (Chae et al., 2019; Martz et al., 2019).

The  role  of  race  and  ethnicity  in  the  incidence,  prevalence,  and  evolution  of
autoimmune diseases is therefore likely representative of epigenetic factors from
a lived experience, overlaid on genetic susceptibility as a result of ancestry, which
may  only  partially  align  with  race  and  ethnic  categorization  (Miller  et  al.,  2011;
Sankar et al., 2004). Therefore, in research of autoimmune diseases, and human
diseases more broadly, race and ethnicity cannot serve as a proxy for genetics.

2021;  Sankar  et  al.,  2004).  These  barriers  can  be  geographic  (e.g.,  avail-
ability  of  services  in  rural  areas),  economic,  and  rooted  in  sociocultural
experiences that can result in mistrust of medicine or medical services.

The  previous  discussion  has  highlighted  diseases  with  moderate  to
strong predominance in women and diseases with increased risk in racial
and  ethnic  minority  populations.  Within  the  full  spectrum  of  autoim-
mune diseases, however, many other autoimmune illnesses do not reflect
this  pattern.  Differences  in  the  incidence  or  severity  of  diseases  across
demographic groups may have important implications for diagnosis and
management of disease and may implicate the importance of genetic sus-
ceptibility in conjunction with environmental factors in disease pathogen-
esis. The committee believes that these striking variations in sex, race, and
age patterns among autoimmune diseases are worthy of further research.

Finding: There is a lack of population-based data from diverse popu-
lations  to  accurately  assess  the  incidence,  prevalence,  lifetime  risk,
epidemiologic  trends,  and  the  extent  of  the  impact  of  autoimmune
diseases  on  the  U.S.  population.  In  addition,  existing  data  may  not
distinguish  sex  and  gender.  The  best  available  long-term  data  are
from a relatively racially and socioeconomically homogenous popula-
tion, thereby limiting its application for understanding the variation


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

in  genetic  susceptibility  and  the  variety  of  exposures,  experiences,
and socioeconomic drivers of autoimmune diseases.

Conclusion: There is a need for population-based epidemiology studies that
can provide the basis for studying numerous autoimmune diseases over at
least a 20-year period. This resource could collectively provide a picture of
the impact of these diseases in all groups representative of the U.S. popula­
tion, and investigators could use it to facilitate the kind of population-based
research needed to fully understand the development and prognosis of these
diseases.

Coexisting Autoimmune Diseases

Historically, medical management occurring in subspecialties accord-
ing to the organ system involved may have obscured associations between
autoimmune diseases. However, shared features among certain autoim-
mune  diseases  is  so  well  recognized,  particularly  within  rheumatology,
that nomenclature distinguishes between disease that is primary (stand-
alone)  or  secondary  to  another  autoimmune  condition.  In  one  study,  a
second diagnosable autoimmune disease occurred in 52 percent of those
diagnosed with Sjögren’s disease, 43 percent of those with antiphospho-
lipid  syndrome,  38  percent  of  those  with  SLE,  and  30  percent  of  those
with  rheumatoid  arthritis  (Lockshin  et  al.,  2015).  The  terms  “primary”
and  “secondary”  are  misleading,  however,  since  no  evidence  exists  to
support  the  hypotheses  that  one  autoimmune  disease  precedes,  causes,
or dominates the other, or even that they are independently diagnosable
illnesses. The appropriateness of such terminology was recently reviewed
for Sjögren’s disease (Kollert and Fisher, 2020), but the concepts discussed
apply  to  other  autoimmune  diseases  as  well.  Thus,  the  designation  of
“primary” or “secondary” has largely fallen out of favor.

In the medical literature, definitions of terms such as “comorbidity”
and “complication” can be fluid and overlapping (Valderas et al., 2009).
That much remains unknown about autoimmune diseases further com-
plicates the use of precise definitions. For the purpose of this report, the
committee uses the definitions provided in Box 2-3.

Abundant anecdotal evidence and case series of autoimmune disease
clustering,  beyond  the  classically  described  “overlap”  conditions,  has
prompted  research  addressing  whether  co-occurrence  of  selected  auto-
immune diseases occurs within individuals and families at higher rates
than  expected  by  chance  (Somers  et  al.,  2006).  Investigators  have  not
studied all combinations of autoimmune diseases at the population level,
and  key  studies  on  autoimmune  coexistence  within  individuals  have
focused largely on multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune

the autoimmune disease or its treatment.

Comorbidity: A coexisting non-autoimmune illness.

thyroiditis  (Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis),  type  1  diabetes,  IBD,  and  vitiligo
as index conditions (Cooper et al., 2009). Overall, data support the idea
that intra-person co-occurrence does occur at greater than expected rates
for several combinations of autoimmune disease. For example, two large
studies—one  examining  Kaiser  Permanente  Health  Plan  records  and
another examining two U.S. medical claim data sets—found that persons
diagnosed with IBD had a significantly increased risk of developing mul-
tiple  sclerosis,  psoriasis  or  psoriatic  arthritis,  and  rheumatoid  arthritis
compared with persons without an IBD diagnosis; moreover, the second
study also found an increased risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis
(Cohen et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2007).

A major epidemiologic study in the United Kingdom investigated the
co-occurrence of four autoimmune conditions within individuals—mul-
tiple  sclerosis,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  type  1  diabetes,  and  autoimmune
thyroiditis  (Somers  et  al.,  2009).  After  controlling  for  age  and  calendar
year,  this  study  documented  increased  co-occurrence  between  rheuma-
toid arthritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes compared with
population expected rates, regardless of diagnostic sequence; sex-specific
results  were  consistent  with  the  overall  findings  (Figure  2-4).  The  mag-
nitude  of  association  was  most  prominent  for  autoimmune  thyroiditis
among patients with type 1 diabetes, in which risk was more than four
times  that  expected.  A  notable  exception  to  the  premise  of  clustering
was between multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, where findings
suggested  an  inverse  association.  Importantly,  this  study  predated  the
availability  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  tumor  necrosis  factor  inhibitors,
used  today  to  treat  some  autoimmune  diseases,  which  otherwise  could
have confounded results given reports of multiple sclerosis in association


































































































































ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

with  such  treatment. An  inverse  association  between  multiple  sclerosis
and  rheumatoid  arthritis  was  also  supported  by  a  pair  of  Danish  stud-
ies  of  individuals  and  families  (Eaton  et  al.,  2007;  Nielsen  et  al.,  2008)
and within families based on a systematic review (Somers et al., 2006). A
broader implication is that characterization of baseline rates of coexistence
provides  important  context  for  interpreting  pharmacovigilance  data  as
immunotherapy options continue to expand (Somers et al., 2009).

Family  studies  have  also  reported  increased  occurrence  of  autoim-
mune  diseases  among  first  degree  relatives  of  case  versus  control  indi-
viduals. Aside from the combinations of autoimmune diseases detected
within  individuals  described  above,  additional  disease  associations
reported  in  family  studies  include  polyarteritis  nodosa,  Addison’s  dis-
ease, Crohn’s disease, and “autoimmune diseases in general” in relatives
of individuals with multiple sclerosis; autoimmune thyroid diseases and
“autoimmune  diseases  in  general”  for  SLE;  “autoimmune  diseases  in
general”  for  Sjögren’s  disease;  and  autoimmune  thyroid  diseases  and
“autoimmune diseases in general” for idiopathic inflammatory myopathy
(Cooper et al., 2009).

Finding: Limited data exist on the presence of co-occurring autoim-
mune diseases in individuals, and the studies have concentrated on
comparatively few autoimmune diseases when measured against the
large  number  of  diseases  generally  accepted  as  being  autoimmune
diseases.

Conclusion: Additional research is needed to identify the patterns of a broad
range of co-occurring autoimmune diseases as this could provide important
context  for  interpreting  pharmacovigilance  data  and  provide  insight  into
underlying biologic mechanisms that could inform strategies for the preven­
tion, early diagnosis, and treatment of subsequent autoimmune diseases in
individuals with autoimmune disease.

Morbidity, Mortality, and Quality of Life

The manifestations and consequences of autoimmune diseases vary
depending  on  the  target  organs  or  systems.  It  is  important  to  view  the
effects of autoimmune diseases not just through a lens directed at physical
health,  but  through  one  that  also  views  elements  such  as  normal  social
interaction and development, mental health, the ability to gain an educa-
tion  and  pursue  employment,  and  the  capacity  to  have  children,  all  of
which can affect quality of life (Figure 2-5).

For some autoimmune diseases, acute effects can be severe. Undiag-
nosed or inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes, for example, can lead to

BACKGROUND ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES


FIGURE 2-5  Effects of autoimmune diseases and treatment.
NOTE: CVD, cardiovascular disease.

diabetic ketoacidosis, coma, and death. SLE has a relatively high mortality
rate and a significant racial disparity in mortality, and mortality risk is sig-
nificantly elevated compared with expected rates (standardized mortality
ratios, 2 to 5 times higher) (Gianfrancesco et al., 2021; Jorge et al., 2018).
Ten-year  mortality  rates  in  an  incidence  cohort  of  SLE  in  Georgia  were
28  percent  in  Black  persons  and  9  percent  in  White  persons  (Lim  et  al.,
2019). In other autoimmune diseases, absolute and relative mortality risks
are  lower. A meta-analysis  of  35  studies  of  IBD  reported  a  standardized
mortality ratio of 1.08 (95 percent confidence interval 0.97–1.21) in incep-
tion cohorts of ulcerative colitis and 1.34 (95 percent confidence interval
1.15–1.56) in inception cohorts of Crohn’s disease (Bewtra et al., 2013).

For  many  autoimmune  conditions,  the  underlying  disease  process,
including a chronic inflammatory response and/or the long-term use of
immunosuppressant drugs, results in increased risks of infectious disease


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

(bacterial, viral, mycobacterial, and fungal) as well as cardiovascular dis-
ease. For example, an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, including
coronary revascularization procedures, myocardial infarction, peripheral
vascular disease, and cardiovascular deaths, occurs for rheumatoid arthri-
tis, systemic sclerosis, and SLE (Kremers et al., 2008; Kurmann et al., 2020;
Man et al., 2013; McMahon et al., 2011). The concept of accelerated athero-
sclerosis associated with autoimmune disease is key to understanding the
increased risk of cardiovascular disease seen even at relatively young ages
(under 45 years of age), and the evaluation and control of cardiovascular
risk factors is a vital component of clinical care for autoimmune diseases
(Durante and Bronzato, 2015).

Autoimmune diseases are also associated with specific types of cancer,
and there is a need for a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms
in these individuals as well as optimal patient care. One study using the
SEER  database  found  that  Sjögren’s  disease,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  SLE,
and autoimmune hemolytic anemia were associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold
increased  risk  of  three  or  more  types  of  lymphomas,  while  psoriasis,
pemphigus, and discoid lupus erythematosus were associated with a 3- to
6-fold increased risk of T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Anderson et al.,
2009; Chiesa Fuxench et al., 2016).

Some autoimmune diseases are also associated with increased cancer
risk at specific sites related to the disease. For example, people with IBD
have an increased incidence of colorectal and other gastrointestinal can-
cers  (Axelrad  et  al.,  2016).  The  role  of  chronic  inflammation,  prolonged
use  of  immunosuppressant  agents,  and  common  risk  factors—as  in  the
case  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  lung  cancer  (Simon  et  al.,  2015)—are
important avenues for future research into cancer risk and autoimmune
disease. In addition, much remains to be learned about how best to treat
patients with autoimmune disease and cancer. Until recently, for example,
patients with autoimmune disease and cancer were excluded from clinical
trials of immunotherapy, which increases the immune system’s capability
to detect and kill tumor cells, because of concerns that the drugs might
increase  autoimmunity  and  possibly  cause  severe  and  life-threatening
complications (NLM, 2021).

Flare-ups  of  symptoms  or  disease  activity,  often  requiring  hospital-
ization, are common in many autoimmune diseases, including multiple
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and IBD (Morales-Tisnes et al., 2021;
Panopalis  et  al.,  2012).  The  remitting-relapsing  course  of  these  diseases
can be challenging to manage from a medical as well as a social and psy-
chological perspective. In addition, the damage caused by some autoim-
mune diseases, such as vasculitis, SLE, and PBC, may require organ trans-
plantation (Albuquerque et al., 2019; Carey et al., 2015; Jain et al., 2021).

BACKGROUND ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES


Pain is a common symptom in many autoimmune diseases although
the etiology varies. For example, owing to nerve involvement or damage
in multiple sclerosis, individuals with the disease often experience spas-
ticity with stiffness, flexor spasms, and uncontrollable muscle contractions
as well as the burning sensations of dysesthesias and facial pain due to
the  severe  stabbing-like  tic  douloureux  (IOM,  2001).  The  chronic  inflam-
mation in rheumatoid arthritis causes progressive joint deterioration and
secondary  osteoarthritis,  leading  to  pain  and  stiffness;  while  up  to  90.4
percent of patients with the disease seek health care for severe pain, pain-
management  options  remain  limited  (Sanchez-Florez  et  al.,  2021).  Per-
sons with IBD often experience joint and spinal pain from inflammatory
arthritis, in addition to abdominal and pelvic pain; in those with perianal
disease from fistulae, pain can be severe. Moreover, pain is a risk factor
for  depression,  anxiety,  and  disability  in  individuals  with  IBD  (van  der
Valk et al., 2014a).

One of the most common complaints among individuals with auto-
immune diseases is fatigue, which in this context is particularly complex
and  variable  because  it  is  likely  linked  to  differing  causal  mechanisms.
Multiple  physiological  processes  may  contribute  to  fatigue  in  autoim-
mune  diseases  including  inflammatory  activation  of  the  immune  sys-
tem  that  affects  the  peripheral  and  central  nervous  systems  (Lee  and
Giuliani, 2019b; Morris et al., 2015). Fatigue can be debilitating, impede
performance of even simple daily tasks, and contribute to mental health
problems such as depressed mood (Zielinski et al., 2019). When fatigue
prevents people from fulfilling normal social roles or holding a job, it can
cause isolation, impose financial burdens on them and their families, and
decrease quality of life. There are currently no long-lasting interventions
to effectively treat fatigue in persons with autoimmune diseases (Zielinski
et al., 2019).

Autoimmune disease can have impacts on physical function. Neuro-
logical effects in multiple sclerosis include vision impairment and prob-
lems with balance and mobility, some being severe, and these effects are
highly important to people living with this condition (Heesen et al., 2008).
Blindness resulting from retinopathy is one of the most common compli-
cations of type 1 diabetes (James et al., 2014). In addition, the lesions and
scarring that can result from skin manifestations of some diseases, such as
psoriasis, can result in disfigurement and stigmatization (van Beugen et
al., 2017). All of these effects can act to isolate a person physically and/or
psychologically, impede social relationships, and restrict access to educa-
tion and employment. Measures focusing on health care utilization may,
in fact, overlook the significant effects of autoimmune diseases.

Children with autoimmune diseases are at risk for adverse impacts on
growth and development as a result of the diseases and their treatment.


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Growth failure, as indicated by height velocity and final height that rank
below  age-  and  sex-expected  percentile  norms,  can  be  caused  by  the
effects on bone growth of chronic systemic inflammation as well as glu-
cocorticoid therapy. Inflammation may also cause delayed puberty, which
may  adversely  impact  peak  bone  mass  and  linear  growth  (Kao  et  al.,
2019). Studies in individuals with childhood-onset SLE have found that
about  15  percent  experience  low  height  velocity  (Bandeira  et  al.,  2006;
Gutierrez-Suarez et al., 2006), that the average final height is lower than
target height, a calculation based on the heights of the parents (Heshin-
Bekenstein et al., 2018), and that these effects are most marked in those
experiencing pre-menarche disease onset (Sontichai et al., 2020). A recent
large  cohort  study  found  that  10  percent  of  children  with  the  systemic
form  of  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  had  short  stature  (Guzman  et  al.,
2017).  However,  some  children  with  autoimmune  disease  experience  a
period of catch-up growth when their disease responds to treatment and/
or glucocorticoid therapy is reduced (Gutierrez-Suarez et al., 2006; Guz-
man  et  al.,  2017).  Growth  hormone  therapy  also  may  mitigate  adverse
growth effects (Simon and Bechtold, 2009). Development of new effective
glucocorticoid-sparing medications may lessen adverse effects on growth
and development for children with autoimmune diseases.

In  young  adults  and  during  the  reproductive  years,  autoimmune
diseases can generate additional risks and complications (Sammaritano et
al., 2020). Pregnancy or the post-partum period may worsen the course of
autoimmune diseases, or the disease itself may result in increased risk of
adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion. This can
lead  to  the  need  to  make  difficult  choices  regarding  the  use  of  disease-
modifying medications during pregnancy. Those wishing to have children
may have to consider the potential effects of treatments on fertility or car-
rying a pregnancy to term, and consider options for oocyte preservation.
Another effect of autoimmune diseases, particularly during the young
and  middle-aged  adult  years,  is  employment-related  disability.  Studies
of  people  with  IBD,  multiple  sclerosis,  psoriasis,  rheumatoid  arthritis,
systemic sclerosis, and SLE report partial or full work disability, with one
cohort study of persons with early rheumatoid arthritis observing a work
disability  rate  of  28  percent  at  study  start  and  44  percent  15  years  later
(Eberhardt et al., 2007; Orbai et al., 2021; Raggi et al., 2016; Scofield et al.,
2008; Sharif et al., 2011; van der Valk et al., 2014b). The relapsing-remitting
nature of these diseases, as well as some of the features that contribute
to disability such as fatigue and pain, may result in additional challenges
to  receiving  disability  benefits  (Scofield  et  al.,  2008).  The  indirect  costs
of lost productivity represent approximately 30 percent of the estimated
total  costs  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  (Birnbaum  et  al.,  2010)  and  psoriasis
(Vanderpuye-Orgle et al., 2015) in the United States, and approximately

BACKGROUND ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES


50  percent  of  the  total  costs  of  IBD  during  the  first  year  after  diagnosis
among working-age people in Sweden (Khalili et al., 2020).

Within the sphere of mental health, depression or depressive symp-
toms  are  common  among  people  living  with  autoimmune  diseases  and
can contribute to the risk of reduced employment  (Eckert  et  al., 2017; Kurd
et al.,  2010;  Moustafa  et al.,  2020;  Vanderpuye-Orgle  et al.,  2015).  In some
diseases, research has not ruled out the possibility that the direct central
nervous system effects of rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and multiple sclerosis
may play a  role  in  inducing depression  (Vallerand  et al.,  2018,  2019).  In
addition,  difficulties  with  mobility,  the  challenges  of  working while  cop-
ing with disease  flares,  and  the  physical  effects  of  specific  diseases  that
produce visible damage to skin or joints are consequences of autoimmune
diseases  that  can  significantly  contribute  to  social  isolation  and  affect
quality of  life.  The  directionality of  effects  of  inflammation,  depression,
fatigue,   and   disease   expression   is   an   area   requiring  additional   research
(Lee  and  Giuliani,  2019a;  Vallerand  et al.,  2018).

Finding: Autoimmune diseases are associated with an increased risk
of cancer.

Conclusion: Additional research is needed to characterize the roles of chronic
inflammation,  prolonged  use  of  immunosuppressant  agents,  and  common
risk factors in increased cancer risk in persons with autoimmune disease. In
addition, there is a need for research to obtain a greater understanding of how
best to treat patients with autoimmune disease and cancer.

Finding: Fatigue and depression or depressive symptoms commonly
occur  in  individuals  with  autoimmune  diseases;  their  etiology  is
unclear.  There  are  no  long-lasting  treatments  for  fatigue.  Both  can
greatly affect quality of life.

Conclusion:  Additional  research  is  needed  to  understand  the  directional­
ity of effects of inflammation, depression, fatigue, and disease expression in
persons with autoimmune diseases.

Estimates of Economic Impact

Few  studies  have  estimated  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  specific
autoimmune diseases in the United States, and the committee is not aware
of  any  studies  attempting  to  estimate  the  overall  costs  of  these  condi-
tions.  The  limited  information  that  is  available  on  the  economic  impact
of specific autoimmune diseases is discussed above and in Chapter 3. The
available  evidence,  while  limited  in  scope,  supports  the  notion  that  the


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

direct and indirect costs of autoimmune diseases can be high (Adelman et
al., 2013; Birnbaum et al., 2010; Vanderpuye-Orgle et al., 2015).

Finding:  There  are  little  data  on  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  in  the
United  States  of  specific  autoimmune  diseases  and  of  autoimmune
diseases overall.

THE LIFE-COURSE FRAMEWORK

AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

The life-course framework for health research is highly relevant for the
study of autoimmune diseases. This framework emphasizes understand-
ing how early life exposures—factors such as environmental toxicants or
psychological stressors that are associated with an outcome—and timing
of these exposures influence health along the life stages (Ben-Shlomo and
Kuh, 2002; Jacob et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2010; Lynch and Smith, 2005), both
at a population and individual patient level. This approach highlights the
importance of conceptualizing autoimmune diseases as a result of social
and environmental factors, or exposures, experienced at different points,
from the in utero period, through childhood and adolescence, and on to
young, mid-, and older adulthood (Figure 2-6).

Examples of environmental exposures are toxicants and viruses, and
examples of social exposures are stressors such as poverty, abuse, and dis-
crimination. The multidisciplinary life-course framework enables exami-
nation  of  how  these  social  and  environmental  determinants  of  health
throughout  the  life  stages  can  differentially  affect  biological  processes
to  influence  the  development  and  the  course  of  chronic  diseases.  For

example, data from the longitudinal World Trade Center Health Registry
show an increased risk for developing systemic autoimmune disease fol-
lowing exposure to dust and traumatic experiences from the September
11,  2001,  terrorist  attack  (Miller-Archie  et  al.,  2020).  Additionally,  data
from  the  Nurses’  Health  Study  II,  a  large  longitudinal  cohort  of  U.S.
female  nurses,  show  an  increased  risk  of  developing  SLE  in  those  with
exposure  to  childhood  physical  and  emotional  abuse  (Feldman  et  al.,
2019).

The epidemiologic study of autoimmune diseases using a life-course
framework emphasizes a longitudinal approach inclusive of all life stages,
linking  a  multiplicity  of  exposures  across  the  life  course  to  later  health
outcomes. It also emphasizes attention to the inter-relationships of these
exposures and vulnerable developmental time periods. For example, find-
ings from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences-funded
Sister Study Cohort (Parks et al., 2016) showed that the early life factors
of preterm birth and childhood pesticide exposure were associated with
development of SLE in adulthood. Additional aspects for chronic autoim-
mune diseases in particular include the fluctuation of disease activity over
periods of flare and remission, as well as the accumulation of permanent
organ  damage  over  time  resulting  from  inflammation.  Accounting  for
these  complexities  often  presents  methodological  challenges  for  model-
ing  repeat  observations,  hierarchical  data,  latent  exposures,  and  mul-
tiple interactive effects (Kuh et al., 2003). Researchers have used complex
analytic models, such as multi-level models, latent growth models, and
Markov models in studying chronic diseases, and they are highly useful
for understanding complex autoimmune diseases.

While researchers have applied the life-course framework to the epi-
demiologic study of populations, it is also useful for studying disease at
the individual level (Halfon and Hochstein, 2002). Measuring the effect
of socio-environmental factors on individuals with autoimmune disease
across time and critical developmental periods increases the understand-
ing of disease mechanisms, trajectories, and heterogeneity. This is of par-
ticular  relevance  to  studying  autoimmune  diseases  because  they  typi-
cally evolve over time, and a given disease can manifest differently from
patient  to  patient.  To  understand  the  mechanisms  underlying  develop-
ment and course of autoimmune diseases, it is important to characterize
changes in biologic structure and function across the lifespan, and how
genetic,  social,  and  environmental  factors  cause  deviation  in  expected
biologic  trajectories  of  typical  development  (Hardy  and  O’Neill,  2020).
These trajectories may be non-linear, reflecting critical exposure periods,
differential impacts across time and biologic structures, and the biologic
impact of cumulative exposures. To increase knowledge of autoimmune
disease  and  develop  treatments,  long-term  systems  for  data  collection


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

and complex analytic approaches are  necessary to  model  these aspects  of
disease  mechanisms  and  trajectories  within and  across  individuals  and  to
elucidate  the  heterogeneity present within diseases.

Several implications arise from incorporating a life-course approach

for studying autoimmune diseases:





	 This approach requires longitudinal studies that incorporate chil-
dren  and  adult  populations,  with  particular  attention  to  critical
life periods for the effects of inflammation and disease damage.
	 Methodological  expertise  is  critical  for  modeling  the  issues  of
time,  timing,  and  inter-relationship  of  exposures  in  relation  to
disease mechanisms and outcomes.

	 A team science approach is key to bringing together multidisci-
plinary expertise in genetics and biology, social and environmen-
tal factors, life stages, and other relevant knowledge areas.
	 Although the life-course approach involves epidemiology at the
population level, it is also relevant to understanding disease pro-
cesses at the individual patient level. It therefore provides under-
standing of opportunities for development of clinical treatments
and behavioral interventions, as well as policy changes aimed at
both prevention and provision of interventions.

Finding: A life-course approach to the epidemiological study of auto-
immune disease could involve longitudinal studies that incorporate
children  and  adult  populations,  enable  modeling  of  the  issues  of
time, timing, and inter-relationship of exposures in relation to disease
mechanisms  and  outcomes,  and  engage  multidisciplinary  expertise
in genetics and biology, social and environmental factors, life stages,
and other relevant knowledge areas. Such an approach could better
characterize the disease processes of autoimmune diseases, conditions
that can affect individuals at any age and that are chronic, heteroge-
neous, and may involve flare and remission.

SUMMARY AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS

Autoimmunity  arises  when  the  immune  system  fails  to  distinguish
self from non-self. This can result, over time, in disease conditions involv-
ing pathological tissue damage caused by autoreactive T cells and auto-
antibodies. Both the innate and adaptive immune systems are involved in
promoting autoimmune disease, and genetics, social and environmental
exposures,  and  sex  differences  may  contribute  to  the  development  or
exacerbation of autoimmune diseases.

BACKGROUND ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES


There is no consensus definition of autoimmune disease. For more than
50  years,  clinical  criteria  such  as  specific  autoantibodies  and  symptoms
have been used to characterize and classify autoimmune diseases. More
recently,  insights  from  research  on  biologic  mechanisms  have  revealed
commonalities  between  autoimmune  diseases  and  autoinflammatory
diseases, as well as other diseases that are not considered to be autoim-
mune  diseases,  making  the  definition  less  clear-cut.  The  two  different
approaches  to  characterize  and  understand  autoimmune  diseases  each
have advantages. Defining autoimmune diseases according to biological
mechanisms  may  be  useful  in  developing  interventions  and  treatment,
particularly when the mechanisms are shared across diseases. Character-
izing  autoimmune  diseases  by  clinical  phenotype  alone,  however,  can
impact patient care and impede research. An atypical presentation of an
autoimmune disease, for example, could slow its diagnosis and treatment,
or result in the person with the disease being excluded from a clinical trial
when their inclusion might provide insight into the disease.

Incidence and prevalence data for autoimmune diseases in the United
States are limited and not easily accessible. The last study that considered
the prevalence of autoimmune diseases as a whole in the United States
estimated a 7.6 to 9.4 percent prevalence of these conditions, but the study
focused on just 29 autoimmune diseases and was published more than a
decade ago (Cooper et al., 2009). Among the most common autoimmune
diseases are celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, IBD, and type
1 diabetes. A critical limitation is the lack of population-based data from
diverse populations that would enable researchers to accurately assess the
incidence, prevalence, lifetime risk, and epidemiologic trends of autoim-
mune diseases in the U.S. population as well as extent of their impact.

Many, but not all, autoimmune diseases predominantly affect women,
with some female-to-male incidence ratios equaling 6:1 or greater. Excep-
tions include type 1 diabetes and myocarditis, which occur more often in
males (Coronado et al., 2019; Fairweather et al., 2013). No single pattern
of racial and ethnic disparities is seen in incidence or prevalence among
autoimmune diseases; for some conditions, the highest rates occur among
Black, American  Indian,  and Alaska  Native  populations,  while  for  oth-
ers, the highest rates occur in White populations (Izmirly et al., 2021b).
Researchers have also observed disparities in the severity and prognosis
of  autoimmune  diseases  according  to  race  and  ethnicity  (Barton  et  al.,
2011; Lim et al., 2019; Ventura et al., 2017). Research is needed to identify
the reasons for these and other disparities. Autoimmune diseases display
varied age-of-onset patterns, with some occurring primarily in children,
teens,  and  young  adults,  such  as  type  1  diabetes,  and  others  occurring
more  commonly  through  adulthood  or  reaching  the  highest  incidence
after age 60, such as primary Sjögren’s disease.


ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Autoimmune diseases are heterogeneous and long-lasting conditions.
The impact on physical health—which can include pain and fatigue, an
increased risk of developing a wide variety of other conditions, impaired
growth  and  development,  disfigurement,  disability,  functional  impair-
ment,  and  death—is  substantial.  Having  an  autoimmune  disease  may
carry  an  increased  risk  of  cancer  (Anderson  et  al.,  2009; Axelrad  et  al.,
2016;  Chiesa  Fuxench  et  al.,  2016);  research  is  needed  to  establish  how
best to treat the patient. Autoimmune diseases can have adverse effects
on social interaction and development, mental health, the capacity to have
children, and education and employment.

Economic-impact research is inadequate, but available data indicate
that  the  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  autoimmune  diseases  can  be  high.
Accurate mortality data are also lacking, one reason being that death cer-
tificates may not provide complete information on the autoimmune dis-
ease that contributed to death (Calvo-Alén et al., 2005; Molina et al., 2015).
The  study  of  co-occurring  autoimmune  diseases  in  individuals  has
focused largely on multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune
thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes, and IBD, with several combinations occurring
at greater than expected rates. A broader understanding of the patterns of
coexisting autoimmune diseases, as well as of their underlying biologic
mechanisms, could inform strategies for the prevention, early diagnosis,
and  treatment  of  subsequent  autoimmune  diseases  in  individuals  with
one autoimmune disease.

Finally,  applying  a  life-course,  multidisciplinary  framework  to  lon-
gitudinal  epidemiologic  studies  that  include  children  and  adults  could
provide  insight  into  issues  involving  exposures  and  timing  that  play  a
role in the etiology, mechanisms, and course and outcomes of these highly
variable diseases.

Overview of Select Autoimmune Diseases

As noted in Chapter 1, the committee focused a literature review on a
select number of autoimmune conditions. These autoimmune diseases—
Sjögren’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid
syndrome  (APS),  rheumatoid  arthritis,  psoriasis,  inflammatory  bowel
disease (IBD), celiac disease, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), multiple
sclerosis,  type  1  diabetes,  and  autoimmune  thyroid  disease—serve  as
representatives  of  this  heterogeneous  class  of  disorders.  As  explained
at greater length in Chapter 1, the committee included diseases that are
overrepresented  in  women,  affect  multiple  systems,  and  are  associated
with  coexisting  morbidity.  The  committee  selected  diseases  that  collec-
tively can represent the spectrum of autoimmune diseases. The committee
also  took  into  account  the  congressional  language  requesting  the  study
and  the  availability  of  data  to  assess  the  National  Institutes  of  Health
(NIH) research portfolio.

There  are  no  known  cures  for  autoimmune  diseases.  Autoimmune
diseases  may affect any part of  the  body and  sometimes  affect many parts
or result in systemic  features.  Classically, autoimmune diseases have  been
organized or named based on the organ system or tissue affected, and health
care  providers  specializing in areas  of  medicine  that focus  on  those  organ
systems  are  typically the  ones  who  diagnose  and  manage  these  diseases.
However, the specific mechanisms that  dictate which organ an autoimmune
disease  affects  when  it develops  are  not fully understood,  and  many  simi-
larities,   including  genetic   susceptibility  and   disease   mechanisms,   exist
among autoimmune  diseases  that affect different organ  systems.



ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

While  an  immune  response  that  targets  different  organ  systems  or
self-antigens  characterizes  each  disease,  classifying  diseases  by  clini-
cal  manifestations  and  laboratory  tests  that  detect  autoantibodies,  for
example,  may  not  be  the  most  accurate  way  to  guide  therapeutic  deci-
sion  making,  given  that  the  presence  of  similar  clinical  manifestations
or autoantibodies can result from different immunological mechanisms.
For  example,  a  recent  study  of  seven  systemic  autoimmune  diseases—
Sjögren’s  disease,  SLE,  APS,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  systemic  sclerosis,
mixed  connective  tissue  disease,  and  undifferentiated  connective  tissue
disease—reported complex gene expression and epigenetic analyses that
enabled  the  investigators  to  arrange  these  seven  diseases  into  four  dif-
ferent  molecular  clusters,  with  each  disease  represented  across  all  four
clusters (Barturen et al., 2021). Three clusters represented three different
pathologic  immunological  pathways  and  mechanisms  associated  with
disease  activity,  while  the  fourth  “undefined”  cluster  was  more  similar
to that of healthy controls. Over time, most individuals remained within
their original cluster or alternated between their original pathologic clus-
ter  and  the  undefined/healthy-control-like  cluster.  The  authors  suggest
that  defining  such  clusters  may  help  to  guide  therapies  that  are  more
likely to effectively modulate the immune pathways most relevant for a
given  individual’s  autoimmune  disease  manifestations.  Similarly,  clus-
ter analysis may predict the trajectory of rheumatoid arthritis (RA-MAP
Consortium, 2021).

In  this  chapter,  the  committee  provides  an  overview  of  select  auto-
immune diseases to highlight the complexities of autoimmune diseases,
and it has structured the review of each disease to reflect the committee’s
charge  as  directed  in  the  statement  of  task  for  this  study.  To  illustrate
some common complexities—including heterogeneity, targeting of ubiq-
uitous self-antigens, and an absence of adequate diagnostic biomarkers or
effective therapies—the chapter begins with Sjögren’s disease, a systemic
autoimmune disease that has some organ-specific features, is most com-
monly diagnosed in women, and often co-occurs with other autoimmune
diseases. After Sjögren’s disease, the chapter will provide information on
three systemic autoimmune diseases—SLE, APS, and rheumatoid arthri-
tis—followed by discussions on autoimmune diseases that affect a specific
tissue or organ system, including the skin (psoriasis), the gastrointestinal
system (IBD, celiac disease, and PBC), the central nervous system (CNS)
(multiple sclerosis), and the endocrine system (type 1 diabetes and auto-
immune thyroid disease).

Chapter  2  provides  data  on  the  incidence  and  prevalence  of  these
diseases,  and  this  chapter  provides  information  on  sex,  age,  racial,  and
ethnic disparities. In addition, Appendix D provides more detailed epi-
demiologic information for each disease.

SJÖGREN’S DISEASE

Sjögren’s disease (often referred to as Sjögren’s syndrome, though the
term  syndrome  is  less  accurate)  is  a  chronic  autoimmune  disease  with
organ-specific and systemic features (Baer and Hammitt, 2021). Sjögren’s
disease has no well-defined treatments to slow the autoimmune process
(Vivino et al., 2019), which can negatively affect an individual’s quality
of life (Cornec et al., 2017; McCoy et al., 2021; Saldanha et al., 2020; Siva-
kumar et al., 2021). The classic features of Sjögren’s disease include dry-
ness of the mouth and eyes that results from a progressive autoimmune
attack directed toward the saliva-producing (salivary) and tear-producing
(lacrimal) glands. The consequences of this attack range from discomfort
to  vision-threatening  ocular  damage,  loss  of  teeth  resulting  from  exten-
sive dental caries, and difficulty carrying out common activities such as
chewing, swallowing, and talking. Sjögren’s disease often causes dryness
of other parts of the body in addition to the mouth and eyes, including
nasal mucosa (causing irritation and frequent nosebleeds), lower airways
(causing chronic dry cough), skin (causing itchiness), and vaginal mucosa
(causing  general  discomfort  as  well  as  pain  during  sexual  intercourse
and  decreased  sexual  satisfaction)  (Vivino  et  al.,  2019).  Besides  provid-
ing moisture and lubrication, secretions from glands in these tissues help
prevent infections, so gland dysfunction increases risk of infection.

Beyond  dryness,  many  individuals  with  Sjögren’s  disease  develop
severe pain and fatigue. The pain may result from autoimmune inflam-
mation of the joints (arthritis) or muscles (myositis), but more commonly
it occurs without inflammation of the affected areas, making it more dif-
ficult to formally assess or treat. The fatigue that accompanies Sjögren’s
disease is also poorly understood and is difficult to treat. Together, dry-
ness, pain, and fatigue contribute to functional disability, decreased work
productivity,  and  overall  decreased  quality  of  life  (Cornec  et  al.,  2017;
McCoy et al., 2021; Saldanha et al., 2020; Sivakumar et al., 2021; Vivino
et al., 2019). In addition, Sjögren’s disease may affect any organ either by
direct autoimmune attack or as a result of circulating immune complexes
depositing in an organ (Vivino et al., 2019). These extra-glandular mani-
festations may affect joints, muscles, blood cells, kidneys, lungs, skin, the
nervous system, and the gastrointestinal system.

The slowly progressive dryness features may not lead an individual to
seek medical care, though hormone changes associated with menopause
greatly exacerbate the already developing dryness, prompting evaluation
for Sjögren’s disease. Earlier diagnosis may occur when other organs are
affected, leading an individual to seek medical care for the extra-glandu-
lar  manifestations.  However,  health  care  providers  may  fail  to  consider
Sjögren’s disease as a diagnosis when there is a lack of profound dryness

at  presentation  or  when  the  main  symptoms  are  musculoskeletal  pain
and fatigue.

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

Sjögren’s  disease  commonly  co-occurs  with  other  autoimmune  dis-
eases.  Among  the  autoimmune  diseases  that  most  often  co-occur  with
Sjögren’s disease are autoimmune thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
SLE, systemic sclerosis, and autoimmune liver disease, including primary
biliary cholangitis (Anaya et al., 2016). Beyond co-occurring autoimmune
diseases, complications associated with Sjögren’s disease include cardio-
vascular disease, lymphoma, and depression (Beltai et al., 2020; Ekström
Smedby et al., 2008; Westhoff et al., 2012). Sjögren’s disease autoimmunity
confers a 4- to 10-fold increased risk of lymphoma (Ekström Smedby et
al., 2008).

Together with the profound dryness, pain, fatigue, and other disease-
specific effects described above, these complications and coexisting condi-
tions contribute to the overall decrease in quality of life and work produc-
tivity and increase in health care cost in individuals with Sjögren’s disease
(Miyamoto et al., 2019). However, there are no reports in the literature of
detailed studies on the life course of individuals with Sjögren’s disease to
more specifically define the contributions of each possible manifestation
on life course.

In pregnant women with Sjögren’s disease, anti-Sjögren’s syndrome–
related  antigen  A  autoantibodies  (SSA/Ro)  autoantibodies  associated
with Sjögren’s disease can cross the placenta and cause neonatal lupus in
the developing fetus. While most neonatal lupus manifestations resolve
without long-term consequences once the mother’s antibodies have been
cleared from the infant’s circulation, the autoantibodies may damage the
conduction system of the fetal heart, resulting in congenital heart block
that causes severe reduction in fetal heart rate and may lead to fetal death
or  the  need  for  pacemaker  placement  soon  after  birth  (Brucato  et  al.,
2011). Complete heart block occurs in only 1–2 percent of neonatal lupus
cases,  but  the  risk  increases  to  15  percent  for  subsequent  pregnancies.
The diagnosis of neonatal lupus in the baby often prompts initiating tests
of the mother for Sjögren’s disease-associated antibodies, and the formal
diagnosis of Sjögren’s disease, based on clinical findings rather than auto-
antibodies alone, may not occur for months to years later.

Economic Impact

Disability,  decreased  work  productivity,  decreased  quality  of  life,
and direct health care costs contribute to the overall economic impact of
Sjögren’s  disease  (Uchino  and  Schaumberg,  2013).  In  the  United  States,
a retrospective observational study using claims databases reported a 40
percent increase in all-cause health care costs in the year after diagnosis
compared with the year prior to diagnosis (Birt et al., 2017). The average

100

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

cost  during  the  first  year  following  diagnosis  of  Sjögren’s  disease  was
$20,416  per  person.  One  study  found  similar  economic  impact  in  other
countries (Miyamoto et al., 2019).

Risk Factors and Etiology

The  X  chromosome  plays  a  significant  role  in  the  risk  of  develop-
ing  Sjögren’s  disease.  Females  with  the  standard  chromosomal  count
have  a  greater  risk  than  males  with  the  standard  chromosomal  count.
However,  the  prevalence  of  Sjögren’s  disease  was  approximately  three
times higher than in the general population among females with an extra
X  chromosome  (Liu  et  al.,  2016)  and  15  times  higher  in  males  with  an
extra X chromosome (Harris et al., 2016). As in other systemic rheumatic
diseases, genetic variants associated with Sjögren’s disease are complex
and include genes in the region of chromosome 6 that codes for human
leukocyte antigens (HLA), as well as other genes associated with immune
function (Imgenberg-Kreuz et al., 2021; Thorlacius et al., 2020).

Epigenetic  modifications  may  also  predispose  an  individual  to
develop  Sjögren’s  disease  (Imgenberg-Kreuz  et  al.,  2019). Among  envi-
ronmental risk factors, studies have focused on microbial infections, such
as  Epstein-Barr  virus  (EBV),  cytomegalovirus,  and  hepatitis  C  (Björk  et
al., 2020). Despite associations with different viral or bacterial infections,
research has not established a causative role for infections in the develop-
ment of Sjögren’s disease. Studies have also implicated stress, low levels
of vitamin D, and various organic chemical factors in the development of
Sjögren’s disease, but the data do not suggest clear associations with the
disease (Björk et al., 2020).

As with other autoimmune diseases, the immune response targeting
self-antigens in Sjögren’s disease is complex. While the specific autoim-
mune mechanisms in Sjögren’s disease are not fully understood, research
has identified several antigens as targets of autoantibodies (Fayyaz et al.,
2016;  Martín-Nares  and  Hernández-Molina,  2019).  For  diagnostic  pur-
poses,  the  autoantibodies  most  commonly  assayed  include  those  often
found in other autoimmune diseases, such as antinuclear antibodies and
rheumatoid factor. Autoantibodies have been detected in blood samples
up to 20 years prior to diagnosing Sjögren’s disease (Theander et al., 2015).
The autoantibodies most specific for Sjögren’s disease target the Ro52,
Ro60, and La481 antigens, though the antigens are ubiquitously expressed
and autoantibodies specific for these proteins have been detected in other
autoimmune  diseases  (Zampeli  et  al.,  2020). All  three  of  these  proteins

1 These are also called Sjögren’s-syndrome-related antigen A/Ro (SSA/Ro) and Sjögren’s-

syndrome-related antigen B/La (SSB/La).

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

reside inside cells, making it unclear how autoantibodies access them. The
association of anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60, and anti-La48 antibodies in Sjögren’s
disease  and  other  autoimmune  diseases,  as  well  as  in  driving  neonatal
lupus manifestations, is still incompletely understood. Given their ubiq-
uitous  expression  and  association  with  so  many  different  autoimmune
manifestations  and  diseases,  it  is  worth  considering  further  studies  to
identify  the  factors  contributing  to  the  immune  system  targeting  these
antigens  and  the  subsequent  effects  of  the  autoantibodies  on  immune
regulation or dysregulation as a potential pathogenic component of the
autoimmune disease process.

Diagnostic Tools

Diagnosing Sjögren’s disease is not straightforward given the lack of
a single diagnostic test or biomarker and that no well-accepted diagnos-
tic  criteria  exist.  Classification  criteria  developed  for  use  in  identifying
people with Sjögren’s disease for clinical trials often guide diagnosis, but
these  criteria  were  not  intended  to  accurately  diagnose  all  individuals
with Sjögren’s disease (Vivino et al., 2019).

Diagnostic  testing  includes  measuring  the  cardinal  features  of
Sjögren’s  disease:  autoantibodies  as  biomarkers,  inflammation  of  the
affected glands on biopsy, salivary gland biopsy, salivary gland function,
and lacrimal gland function. Imaging the glands with magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or ultrasound may also provide supportive information.
Ultimately, diagnosis depends on the opinion and experience of the physi-
cian, but generally requires a combination of abnormal test results, with
either autoantibodies specific for Sjögren’s disease or positive lip biopsy
required to support a Sjögren’s disease diagnosis.

The  most  reliable  biomarker  currently  available  is  the  anti-SSA/Ro
antibody,   which   comprises   two   different  antibodies   targeting  Ro52   and
Ro60,  but  anti-SSA/Ro  antibodies  may  be  absent  in  up  to  25  to  30  per-
cent of  individuals  with  Sjögren’s  disease.  Some  studies  have  suggested
that  antinuclear   antibodies   and   rheumatoid   factor   might  also   serve   as
biomarkers,   though   the   utility  of   each   in   diagnosing  Sjögren’s   disease
is   a   matter  of   debate.   When  these   antibodies   are   absent,   the   diagnosis
becomes  more  difficult,  especially early in  disease,  such  as  in  childhood,
when  features  of  dryness  may  be  absent.  The  lack  of  more  reliable  bio-
markers  for  early diagnosis  represents  a  barrier  to  diagnosis,  as  well  as  a
key gap in  understanding the  disease  process.

Treatments and Prospects for Cures

Current treatments for the glandular manifestations of Sjögren’s dis-
ease aim to replace tears and saliva or to stimulate increased production

102

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

from the individual’s own glands, but these approaches do not alter the
inflammatory response and are only moderately helpful in relieving dry-
ness. Anti-inflammatory  eye drops may  help  control  the damage  to the
ocular  surface,  but  again,  they  do  not  alter  the  ongoing  systemic  auto-
immune  response.  No  medications  have  been  identified  to  adequately
modulate the autoimmune response or to prevent progression from early
stages of disease, such as in children or young adults, to the more pro-
found  dryness  and  associated  complications  that  occur  later  in  disease.
Similarly, treatments for the progressive fatigue and musculoskeletal pain
are lacking.

When  extra-glandular  manifestations  develop,  clinicians  may  con-
sider immunomodulatory therapies commonly used to treat other auto-
immune  diseases.  There  are  published  consensus  guidelines  that  aim
to  help  direct  therapeutic  decisions  based  on  manifestations  (Lee  et  al.,
2021;  Ramos-Casals  et  al.,  2020;  Vivino  et  al.,  2016).  However,  the  U.S.
Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  has  not  approved  any  systemic
immunomodulatory medications for treating Sjögren’s disease, and large
clinical trials of potential therapies have generally failed to reach primary
endpoints despite promising preliminary data from earlier trials (Fox and
Fox, 2016). It is not clear whether these failures are a result of suboptimal
selection  of  individuals  with  Sjögren’s  disease  or  endpoint  measures,
varied  disease  mechanisms,  or  lack  of  well-established  disease  activity
biomarkers. Given the lack of adequate treatments and incomplete under-
standing  of  the  pathogenesis  of  Sjögren’s  disease,  no  realistic  prospects
for cures exist at this time.

Heterogeneity in Disease

The  committee  determined  that  Sjögren’s  disease  is  an  example  of
the types of heterogeneity that occur in autoimmune disease. The degree
of heterogeneity in many aspects of Sjögren’s disease is a barrier to more
reliable diagnosis and effective treatments. Studies have found variations
in  clinical  features  associated  with  geolocation,  ethnicity,  and  ancestry
(Brito-Zerón et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2017). One recent study used hier-
archical cluster analysis to stratify people with Sjögren’s disease into four
clusters  based  on  the  severity  of  common  symptoms  of  the  condition
(pain,  fatigue,  dryness,  anxiety,  and  depression)  and  found  significant
differences among clusters in immunological measures, including autoan-
tibodies, blood lymphocyte counts, and measures of B cell activity (Tarn
et  al.,  2019). Applying  this  clustering  technique  to  participants  of  prior
clinical  trials  that  failed  to  demonstrate  efficacy  did  identify  treatment
effects  within  specific  clusters.  This  retrospective  analysis  suggests  that

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

103

the heterogeneity of features contributed to the lack of efficacy in these
failed clinical trials, which considered only the total study population.

From a pathophysiologic perspective, investigators demonstrated the
heterogeneity of the interferon signature in the labial minor salivary gland
biopsy specimens of individuals with Sjögren’s disease (Hall et al., 2015).
Specifically,  they  found  a  high  interferon  signature  in  58  percent  of  the
individuals,  and  further  analyses  demonstrated  that  among  these  indi-
viduals  the  interferon  signature  was  dominated  by  type  I  interferon  in
29.0 percent of the biopsy samples, type II interferon in 35.5 percent of the
samples, or a combination of type I and type II interferon in 35.5 percent
of  the  samples.  Moreover,  several  immunological  measures,  including
white blood cell counts, immunoglobulin levels, autoantibodies, degree of
salivary gland inflammation, and measures of gland dysfunction, varied
between individuals with high or low interferon pathways, and some fea-
tures also varied based on the type of interferon dominating the interferon
signature  pattern.  These  findings  suggest  that  different  immunological
pathways may drive different clinical and laboratory parameters, contrib-
uting to disease heterogeneity.

Along  these  lines,  a  recent  study  of  multi-omic  profiling  of  whole
blood samples from individuals with Sjögren’s disease defined a molecu-
lar  classification  strategy  that  led  to  clustering  of  individuals  in  four
cohorts based on gene expression, genetic risk loci, epigenetics, immuno-
logic analyses—cytokine profiles and flow cytometric-based characteriza-
tion of immune cells—and clinical data (Soret et al., 2021). This study also
found interferon signatures within three of the four clusters that included
differing contributions from type I or type II interferons, depending on
the cluster. Differences in cytokine and immune cell profiles suggested a
greater contribution of acute inflammation in one cluster, which may have
therapeutic implications.

Together  these  studies  identify  disease  heterogeneity  in  immuno-
logical mechanisms, laboratory measures of disease, and clinical features.
Better understanding and definition of disease heterogeneity may provide
key insight to better direct specific immunomodulatory therapies for dif-
ferent clusters of individuals with Sjögren’s disease, a key step toward a
personalized medicine approach for this disease.

Animal Models

Investigators have described and used a variety of animal models to
study various aspects of the autoimmune process that occurs in Sjögren’s
disease (Abughanam et al., 2021). While no one animal model perfectly
recapitulates  the  human  disease,  several  models  develop  spontaneous
autoimmunity  with  features  similar  to  Sjögren’s  disease  in  humans,

104

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

including the characteristic lymphocyte-dominant inflammation of lacri-
mal or salivary glands, autoantibodies, and decreased production of tears
and saliva. Several inbred mouse strains or genetically modified mouse
strains spontaneously develop Sjögren’s disease-like disease, providing a
model to study the early immunopathogenic mechanisms that cannot cur-
rently be studied in humans because of the lack of predictive biomarkers.
Investigators have also used immunization of purified antigenic proteins
or viral infection to induce Sjögren’s disease-like autoimmunity in other
animal models.

Research Progress and Gaps

Despite  the  many  gaps  in  understanding  Sjögren’s  disease,  investi-
gators have made considerable progress in defining genetic associations
(Harris et al., 2016; Imgenberg-Kreuz et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2016), patho-
logic roles of innate and adaptive immunity (Chivasso et al., 2021), and
mechanisms involved in the development of lymphomas in Sjögren’s dis-
ease (Stergiou et al., 2020). This progress has contributed to an increased
awareness of Sjögren’s disease and an increase in clinical trials. However,
key gaps remain as obstacles to early diagnosis and effective treatments.
One such barrier is the prolonged time between autoimmunity onset
and diagnosis, resulting from the lack of highly sensitive diagnostic bio-
markers and the lack of awareness of the early manifestations of disease
among  clinicians.  Identifying  early  diagnostic  biomarkers  would  aid  in
developing diagnostic criteria aimed specifically at diagnosis in the early
stages of disease, or if possible, prior to the development of clinical fea-
tures. Such predictive biomarkers would promote interventional studies
to  alter  the  disease  course  before  the  development  of  end-organ  dam-
age  that  may  be  difficult  to  reverse.  The  molecular  characterization  of
Sjögren’s disease has contributed to defining key aspects of disease het-
erogeneity, but at present the different subtypes and specific mechanisms
of Sjögren’s disease are not well defined. The prolonged course of autoim-
munity leading to diagnosis and the lack of adequate surrogate endpoints
make clinical trials less practical, and may be contributing significantly to
the failure of clinical trials to meet study endpoints. However, identifying
clinical  features  that  would  enable  better  classification  of  patients  with
different disease subtypes may enhance the feasibility and effectiveness
of clinical trials. As noted above, a better characterization of the life course
of individuals with Sjögren’s disease is needed.

Sjögren’s  disease  occurs  at  least  as  commonly  (or  more  commonly)
in  individuals  with  other  autoimmune  diseases,  including  rheumatoid
arthritis,  SLE,  and  scleroderma,  as  it  does  in  individuals  without  other
autoimmune diseases, but specific studies aimed at identifying similarities

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

105

and  differences  in  clinical  features,  genetics,  immunological  features,  and
disease  course  are  lacking.  Epidemiologic  studies  to  define  the  incidence
and  prevalence  of  Sjögren’s  disease  regardless  of  the  presence  of  co-
occurring autoimmune  diseases  are  greatly needed.  In  some  individuals
later  diagnosed   with  Sjögren’s   disease,   the   initial  presentation  occurs
early,   during  or   after  pregnancy  in  the  form   of   neonatal   lupus,   which
can  lead   to   a   range   of   features   in  the   infant  resulting  from   the   passage
of   autoantibodies   characteristic   of   Sjögren’s   disease   to   the   fetus   during
development, as described above. Factors that contribute to the severity
of  features  manifested  in  the  infant are  not well-defined,  and  factors  that
promote development of neonatal lupus, especially in previously asymp-
tomatic  mothers,  as  an  initial  manifestation  of  the  presence  of  Sjögren’s
disease-associated  autoantibodies  are  poorly  understood.  Similarly,  the
specific   mechanisms   by  which  these  antibodies   cause  neonatal  lupus
manifestations, which themselves are heterogeneous among affected indi-
viduals,   may  provide   insight  into   potential   pathologic   contributions   of
these  autoantibodies  to  individuals  with Sjögren’s  disease.

SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

SLE, a systemic inflammatory illness, is the prototype systemic auto-
immune disease, characterized by multi-organ inflammation (Vaillant et
al., 2021). The disease is chronic, extremely heterogeneous in manifesta-
tion, and it affects mostly young women and disproportionately those of
color.  SLE  can  occur  in  children,  most  often  during  the  teen  years,  and
symptoms may be similar to those of adults but more severe (Cleveland
Clinic, 2021). A distinctive sign of SLE, a facial rash in the shape of a but-
terfly  that  spreads  across  both  cheeks,  occurs  in  many  but  not  all  cases
(Mayo Clinic, 2021b). Arthritis, rash, cytopenias, lupus nephritis, and neu-
rologic  abnormalities  are  the  most  common  abnormalities  signaling  the
presence of SLE. The disease may be lethal, but most people with SLE suf-
fer unpredictable flares and spontaneous or treatment-induced remissions
(Thanou et al., 2021) and suffer damage resulting from active disease and/
or its treatment. Most flares, however, have no obvious inciting event.

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

SLE  affects  every  organ  system;  damage  accrues  through  active
inflammation, thrombosis, and repair and scarring processes. Individuals
with SLE are subject to inflammatory disease such as pericarditis, valvu-
litis, and myocarditis (Fava and Petri, 2019; Wallace and Gladman, 2019);
atherosclerotic  disease  including  micro-  or  macrovascular  myocardial
infarction  (Roman  et  al.,  2003);  stroke  caused  by  vasculitis,  thrombosis,

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

107

and  atherosclerosis  (Wallace  and  Gladman,  2019);  and  peripheral  neu-
ropathy (Fava and Petri, 2019). In addition, persons with the disease may
experience renal failure resulting from glomerulonephritis, tubulointersti-
tial disease, hypertension, and/or vasculitis (Fava and Petri, 2019) as well
as a modestly increased risk of lymphoma (Bernatsky et al., 2014). Side
effects of treatment include coronary artery disease; retinopathy, includ-
ing cataracts; osteoporosis; and osteonecrosis, bone death caused by poor
blood  supply,  which  can  lead  to  fractures  (Fava  and  Petri,  2019;  Glad-
man et al., 2018; Kamphuis and Silverman, 2010; Wallace and Gladman,
2019). Premature atherosclerosis and bone-related complications, includ-
ing osteoporosis and osteonecrosis, are important SLE-related complica-
tions. Prior to 1955, less than 50 percent of patients survived 5 years after
diagnosis; now, 10-year survival exceeds 90 percent. This has resulted in
an increased rate of reported musculoskeletal conditions (Kennedy and
Khan, 2015).

Some patients may report that osteonecrosis causes a greater reduc-
tion in their quality of life than SLE as the underlying systemic disease.
Treatment with high dose steroids can led to osteonecrosis and pain and
reduced function can be severe, warranting surgical intervention such as
joint replacements. After such surgery, such individuals can be at higher
risk for implant infection, discharge to an inpatient facility, more expen-
sive hospital bills, and increased blood transfusions than people without
SLE (Singh and Cleveland, 2019).

People with SLE are also highly susceptible to bacterial, fungal, viral,
and mycobacterial infections, primarily in the setting of aggressive ther-
apy  with  corticosteroids  and/or  small  molecule  and  biologic  immuno-
suppressant agents, but occasionally in association with disease-induced
severe leukopenia or lymphopenia (Fava and Petri, 2019). Patients suffer
depression,  anxiety,  and  psychosis  caused  by  central  nervous  system
disease, the effects of medications such as corticosteroids, and personal
adaptation to living with an unpredictable, disabling, and painful disease
(Roberts et al., 2018; Siegel et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2017).

About 40 percent of people with SLE test positive for antiphospho-
lipid antibodies (aPL) (Garcia and Erkan, 2018; Meroni and Tsokos, 2019).
Between 20 and 40 percent of people with SLE have other autoimmune
illnesses, such as autoimmune thyroid diseases (Klionsky and Antonelli,
2020) or Sjögren’s disease (Wallace and Gladman, 2019), or have features
of  other  autoimmune  illnesses  such  as  overlapping  thrombocytopenia,
Raynaud’s  syndrome,  or  rheumatoid  arthritis,  also  known  as  “rhupus”
(Antonini et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2017; Lockshin et al., 2015).

Pregnancies are high risk for some women with SLE, with most com-
plications related to hypertension, renal disease, or antiphospholipid syn-
drome rather than to active SLE (Sammaritano et al., 2020). Preeclampsia

108

and premature birth are common complications as well. If the pregnancy
is not complicated, children of mothers with SLE who do not have certain
autoantibodies  are  born  healthy.  However,  antiphospholipid  antibod-
ies   predict  preeclampsia   and   placental   dysfunction  that  leads  to  fetal
growth  restriction  and/or death.  Anti-SSA/Ro  and  anti-SSB/La  occur  in
all children with neonatal lupus syndrome, which occurs in a minority of
children  born  to  women who  carry these  antibodies  (Yoshimi  et al.,  2012).
Neonatal  lupus  is  characterized  by hepatitis,  cytopenias,  and  rash,  which
are  transient and  common,  and  congenital  heart block,  which is  perma-
nent  but  rare   (Diaz   et  al.,   2021).   Maternal   autoantibodies   persist  in   the
mothers  but not typically in  babies  beyond  the  first year  of  life  (Zuppa  et
al.,  2017).  Except when  the  mother  is  taking contraindicated  medications,
breastfeeding is safe for both mother and child (Sammaritano et al., 2020).
Phenotypic  heterogeneity—the  differing  presentations  of  SLE—pre-
cludes  the  ability  to  confidently  predict  disease  progression.  SLE  is  a
lifelong  illness,  with  10-year  survival  rates  of  greater  than  90  percent
and continuing inflammation and illness- and treatment-related damage
driving patient-specific outcomes (Reppe Moe et al., 2021; Singh and Yen,
2018). The illness is more episodic than progressive, with flares and remis-
sions. Damage accrues in different organs at different rates and may vary
based on severity of inflammation, differences in healing mechanisms and
scarring, and differing effects of medication.

SLE severely affects quality of life in many ways. Most patients suf-
fer fatigue and neurocognitive and musculoskeletal symptoms including
pain  and  weakness  (Natalucci  et  al.,  2021;  Olesinska  and  Saletra,  2018;
Takase et al., 2021). SLE causes changes in body image as a result of SLE-
related effects such as skin rashes and hair loss, and changes in mental
status  as  a  result  of  both  the  disease  and  its  treatment  (Olesinska  and
Saletra, 2018; Yoon et al., 2019). The disease adversely affects the individ-
ual’s family relations, personal relationships, physical fitness, and sexual
activity  (Olesinska  and  Saletra,  2018).  Invisible  symptoms  may  prompt
disbelief  in  family,  acquaintances,  and  even  physicians.  Coexisting  dis-
eases complicate evaluation and treatment of SLE. Recent studies of SLE
indicate  patients’  and  physicians’  desire  to  see  improved  quality  of  life
as a target of treatment (Kernder et al., 2020; Pereira et al., 2020; Shi et al.,
2021) by non-pharmacological (Chang et al., 2021) and pharmacological
interventions (Jolly et al., 2021).

Economic Impact

The  economic  costs  of  SLE  are  high,  comprising  both  direct  costs
for delivery of medical care and indirect costs for lost employment pro-
ductivity (Abu Bakar et al., 2020; Agarwal and Kumar, 2016), as well as

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

109

intangible costs resulting from pain and suffering. Studies of direct costs
have shown that patients with SLE incur health care costs that are twice as
high as a control population. Acute hospitalization accounts for up to 50
percent of these increased costs, followed by medications and physician
visits (Panopalis et al., 2012). Higher costs are associated with SLE renal
disease, higher disease activity, and impaired physical and mental func-
tion. In a large U.S. study of adults with SLE, total unadjusted costs were
significantly higher among Medicaid-insured than commercially insured
patients (Clarke et al., 2020; Panopalis et al., 2012).

As a significant cause of work disability in the United States, the indi-
rect costs of SLE also convey a high individual and societal cost resulting
from  unemployment  and  decreased  productivity.  A  longitudinal  study
found that 49 percent of adults with SLE in the southeastern United States
experienced work loss over an average disease duration of 13 years. Those
most affected had severe disease activity and organ damage, and Black
residents were more likely than White residents to experience unemploy-
ment  as  a  result  of  having  SLE  (Drenkard  et  al.,  2014).  In  addition,  for
those individuals remaining employed, impaired work productivity was
associated with severe fatigue, and neurocognitive and musculoskeletal
symptoms.

Risk Factors and Etiology

The cause of SLE is unknown, though there appears to be a genetic
contribution.  Family  histories  of  SLE  and  related  autoimmune  diseases
are common in close relatives of individuals with SLE (Kuo et al., 2015).
Twin studies show much higher concordance in identical than in fraternal
twins (Block et al., 1975, 1976; Deapen et al., 1992; Reichlin et al., 1992).
Many people with SLE have been found to have susceptibility genes that
are thought to be contributory but not directly causal in the development
of  SLE.  These  include  genetic  variants  in  HLA  and  non-HLA  coding
regions, some of which have been found to play a role in immune regula-
tion (Ghodke-Puranik and Niewold, 2015). In addition, many people once
thought to have early-onset SLE are now known to have specific single-
gene  (monogenic)  mutations,  often  in  interferon  pathways.  Interferon
pathway abnormalities are common. Examples are VEXAS syndrome and
Aicardi-Goutière syndrome (Beck et al., 2020; Demirkaya et al., 2020). No
consensus exists on whether monogenic SLE-like illnesses should be clas-
sified as a subset of SLE or as separate genetic disorders.

Other than family history, there is limited information on risk factors
or etiologies for initiation of SLE, though exogenous events such as infec-
tion or extensive ultra-violet light exposure may trigger exacerbations of
SLE, including the first symptoms that bring an individual to medical care

110

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

(Estadt  et  al.,  2021;  Harley  and  James,  2006).  Environmental  exposures
that have most consistently been associated with risk of developing SLE
are occupational exposure to respirable silica (Morotti et al., 2021), smok-
ing history (Parisis et al., 2019), and vitamin D deficiency (Hassanalilou
et al., 2017; Young et al., 2017). Viral infections and microbiomic factors
may play a role in inducing or exacerbating SLE in susceptible persons
(Quaglia  et  al.,  2021). A recent  meta-analysis  of  33  studies  found  a  sig-
nificantly  higher  seropositivity  for  EBV  antibodies  in  persons  with  SLE
compared with controls (Li et al., 2019). Recent studies have also found
associations between psychosocial trauma and depression with increased
risk for developing SLE (Bookwalter et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2017, 2020).
The  above  environmental  and  psychosocial  factors  may  contribute  to
epigenetic changes that modify expression of SLE-related genes, thereby
leading to immune dysregulation (Ghodke-Puranik and Niewold, 2015).

Diagnostic Tools

The heterogeneous phenotypes, laboratory manifestations, and prog-
noses of SLE make diagnosis challenging. Disease severity for SLE ranges
from trivial to lethal, and clinical presentations most often include arthri-
tis, skin rashes, kidney disease, and blood disorders, though SLE can affect
every organ in the body in any order at any time. SLE may present as an
acute illness or it may take decades after first recognition of symptoms or
abnormal laboratory tests to become clinically diagnosable (Arbuckle et
al., 2003). Patients with nephritis only, rash only, or hematological mani-
festations  only—and  sharing  no  other  clinical  features—can  all  be  said
to have SLE. Some patients present with specific manifestations, such as
seizure or renal failure, while others first develop a symptomatic problem
a decade or more after first being diagnosed. Though trigger factors that
induce flares, such as infection, sunlight exposure, allergic reactions, may
play a role in a few individual patients, the timing of manifestations in
most patients is not understood.

Autoantibodies  are  the  most  consistent  laboratory  feature  of  SLE.
Most people with the condition have high titer antinuclear antibody, but
antinuclear antibody is commonly found in other autoimmune diseases,
such  as  Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis,  Sjögren’s  disease,  and  scleroderma,  as
well as in otherwise normal people on occasion (Wallace and Gladman,
2019). Anti-DNA antibody and anti-Smith antibody, when present at high
titer in symptomatic individuals, are diagnostic of SLE. In asymptomatic
individuals, these autoantibodies suggest but do not predict future clini-
cally  evident  SLE  (Wallace  and  Gladman,  2019).  Other  autoantibodies,
including  anti-ribonuclear  protein,  anti-SSA/Ro,  and  anti-SSB/La  are

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

111

commonly seen in people with SLE but are not diagnostic and instead may
suggest concomitant Sjögren’s disease or mixed connective tissue disease
(Pisetsky, 2020). Individuals with SLE usually have abnormal markers of
inflammation, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive pro-
tein, and complement activation, and about half of those with SLE have
proteinuria.  When  clinically  indicated,  skin,  kidney,  and  other  biopsies
provide definitive diagnostic information (Wallace and Gladman, 2019).
Investigators  have  developed  classification  criteria  for  SLE  for
research purposes as a potential means of identifying relatively homoge-
neous groups of patients for inclusion in studies and trials. In 1982 and
again in 1997, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) published
SLE  classification  criteria  (Hochberg,  1997;  Tan  et  al.,  1982).  The  2012
Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification criteria
(Petri et al., 2012) updated the ACR criteria to refine the SLE definition,
include  additional  clinical  and  lab  criteria,  and  emphasize  SLE  as  pri-
marily an autoantibody driven disease. These criteria are not limited to
research  purposes  (Fava  and  Petri,  2019).  Most  recently,  the  2019  Euro-
pean Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology2 and ACR Rheumatology
revised SLE classification criteria for research (Aringer et al., 2019; Fava
and Petri, 2019), now requiring antinuclear antibody as an entry criterion
for clinical trials, along with a weighted and additive scoring system for
other  criteria.  While  these  classification  schema  are  useful  for  clinical
guidance, being specific but not sensitive, they are most appropriate for
use in research rather than clinical diagnosis and management.

Treatments and Prospects for Cures

Most clinical and basic research studies of SLE involve patients who
fulfill  classification  criteria,  excluding  almost  half  of  patients  who  are
considered by their physicians to have SLE but who do not fulfill these
criteria (Jia et al., 2017; Lockshin et al., 2015, 2019). Specific severity, organ
system  involvement,  and  duration-related  details  dictate  treatment,  the
latter  focusing  on  accrued  damage  from  either  illness  or  its  treatment.
A number of entities have developed general treatment guidance. Some
treatment recommendations, mostly based on systematic literature review,
are provided by national and international rheumatology societies such
as the ACR and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology
(Fanouriakis et al., 2019). Other recommendations are expert opinions that
are not necessarily sponsored by organizations (Durcan et al., 2019). More
specific treatment protocols exist for subsets of people with SLE, such as
those with International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society

2 Formerly the European League Against Rheumatism.

112

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

(ISN/RPS) class IV lupus nephritis. Periodic treatment changes are com-
mon. Approximately one-third of SLE patients discontinue hydroxychlo-
roquine—a first line of treatment—because they experience remission or
find the medications ineffective (Mehat et al., 2017).

Standard therapies include hydroxychloroquine (the toxicity of which
is related to lifetime dose), topical and systemic corticosteroids, and small
molecule immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathio-
prine, and cyclophosphamide (Durcan et al., 2019; Fava and Petri, 2019).
In  2011,  FDA approved  belimumab,  a  B  cell-depleting  agent  that  has  a
shorter duration and less-toxic effect than rituximab, for SLE treatment in
adults—the first drug approved for SLE in over 50 years. Indications were
expanded to include pediatric patients in 2019 and SLE nephritis in 2020.
FDA also approved voclosporin, an oral calcineurin inhibitor, in 2021 for
the treatment of lupus nephritis, a manifestation of SLE in adults (FDA,
2021a; Rovin et al., 2021). Cytokine inhibitors targeted to type 1 interferon,
such as anifrolumab, reduce disease activity (Morand et al., 2020). Anifro-
lumab was approved for use in SLE in 2021 (FDA, 2021c).

Because uncontrolled immune response, usually expressed by auto-
antibodies, is the likely cause of SLE symptoms, studies are focusing on
monoclonal antibodies to block specific cellular and molecular pathways
thought  to  be  abnormal  in  SLE.  Targets  of  therapies  in  ongoing  clini-
cal  trials  include  B  cells  that  synthesize  autoantibodies  (dapirolizumab,
obinutuzumab)  and  T  cells  that  instruct  B  cells  as  to  what  antibodies
they should produce (itolizumab, ALPN-101). The interferon pathway is
another clinical trial target (BIIB059). Other clinical trials are examining
small  molecule  pharmaceuticals  that  block  binding  of  antigen  to  cells
(sirolimus) or mark immune and inflammatory cells for destruction (KPG-
818) and IL-18 blockers for example.

Morbidity and mortality can result from kidney failure, heart failure,
stroke, or infection during immunosuppressive therapy (Murimi-Worstell
et al., 2020; Wallace and Gladman, 2019). Additional causes of disability
include  destructive  arthritis,  osteonecrosis,  osteoporosis,  and  dementia
(Lin et al., 2016; Wallace and Gladman, 2019). There is no known approach
for  preventing  SLE,  but  long-term  studies  may  be  able  identify  trigger
factors for transition from autoantibody-positive but asymptomatic dis-
ease to symptomatic disease or triggers for flares in clinically quiescent
patients.

Animal Models

Animal  models  for  SLE  have  existed  for  more  than  four  decades
(Richard  and  Gilkeson,  2018).  While  illustrative  of  specific  mechanisms
of  illness,  such  as  glomerulonephritis,  none  can  completely  reproduce

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

113

human  SLE.  Existing  mouse  models  differ  from  human  SLE  in  predict-
ability  of  onset,  sex  distribution,  absence  of  flares,  and  remissions,  and
they  are  limited  for  the  most  part  to  modeling  specific  manifestations
such as nephritis, dermatitis, or arthritis (Moore et al., 2021; Richard and
Gilkeson, 2018). These models do provide hypothesis-testing opportuni-
ties when assessing whether specific immune pathways are involved in
the  disease,  and  they  can  find  use  in  testing  new  potential  therapies  in
early preclinical studies.

Research Progress and Gaps

Major research progress in SLE consists of understanding—and tar-
geting  treatment  to—molecular  mechanisms  that  contribute  to  specific,
if  limited,  forms  of  the  illness  (Barrat  et  al.,  2019;  Chen  et  al.,  2021).
Progress in understanding SLE will require research that leads to a bet-
ter  understanding  of  the  basis  of  heterogeneity,  change  over  time,  epi-
demiology,  and  the  relationship  between  phenotypic  heterogeneity  and
disease  progression.  For  instance,  despite  extensive  genetic,  epigenetic,
and environmental data, questions remain as to why SLE affects mostly
women,  more  non-White  people,  and  mostly  young  persons;  why  SLE
flares and remits; and why in some people SLE targets the kidneys, and
in others the skin, joints, or blood (Lockshin, 2007). Research to identify
the  circumstances  that  trigger  transition  from  autoantibody-positive  to
clinical SLE, or the triggers for flares in clinically quiescent people with
the disease could lead to prevention and early intervention or treatment.
In areas such as neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) advances in biomarkers
and  disease  models  are  needed.  There  is  an  unmet  need  for  diagnostic
biomarkers and innovation in imaging modalities for NPSLE (Kivity et al.,
2015). Although some autoantibodies have been suggested as a potential
biomarker,  only  a  few  antibodies  have  met  the  exploratory  criteria  and
are  being  used  in  the  diagnosis  and  therapeutic  decisions  (Govoni  and
Hanly, 2020; Sarwar et al., 2021). In addition to biomarkers, attention to
models is also critical as in the case of neuropsychiatric manifestations of
SLE (Karnopp et al., 2021).

Additionally, more research is needed to identify risk factors, includ-
ing  environmental  and  psychosocial  factors  that  contribute  to  disease
initiation.  Over  the  past  few  years,  however,  investigators  have  made
advances  in  understanding  the  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  underly-
ing the heterogeneity of SLE, guiding drug development and leading to
some  successful  clinical  trials  and  FDA drug  approval  as  noted  above.
Gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms triggering onset of SLE
and those contributing to disease activity over time requires conducting
additional longitudinal studies, collecting epidemiologic data, and using

114

life-course methodologies. In the interim, developing more sensitive clas-
sification  schema  for  clinical  diagnosis  and  disease  management  could
improve the care of persons who may have SLE but who, under current
guidelines, do not receive a diagnosis or treatment for the disease.

ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which was initially thought to be
a subset of SLE but was defined as a separate syndrome in 1989 (Lock-
shin and Harris, 2017), has three manifestations. Thrombotic APS occurs
in episodes, often triggered by an infection or a change in therapy, and
is characterized by recurrent thromboses, heart valve disease, and a type
of microangiopathic kidney involvement that differs from that seen with
SLE. Long-term outcomes for thrombotic APS depend on the extent and
location  of  thromboses;  for  example,  one  case  could  lead  to  deep  vein
thrombosis and another to stroke.

Obstetric APS is characterized by recurrent pregnancy complications
including  fetal  growth  restriction,  fetal  death,  and  severe  preeclampsia.
Most women with obstetric APS do not have thrombotic APS, and women
with  thrombotic  APS  do  not  necessarily  develop  obstetric  APS  (Garcia
and  Erkan,  2018;  Simioni,  2012).  However,  women  with APS  who  have
suffered preeclampsia are at increased risk for cardiovascular events later
in life (Simard et al., 2021).

Catastrophic APS (CAPS), a highly lethal form of the disease, affects
less than 1 percent of those with APS (Cervera, 2017; Cervera and Group,
2010).  In  CAPS,  severe,  often  lethal  multi-organ  thromboses  occur  over
short periods of time (Garcia and Erkan, 2018).

Epidemiology and Impact

Information on disparities in the epidemiology of APS can be found

in Box 3-3.

•  The female-to-male ratio for APS is 1.0 for individuals ages 18 and older
•  APS associated with SLE is female predominant
•  The  risk  of APS  is  greatest  in  White  populations  and  relatively  low  in  Black

populations (Garcia and Erkan, 2018)

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

Coexisting disease, overlap syndromes, progressive damage, and the
adverse  effects  of  treatment  complicate APS.  For  example,  in  one  small
study,  33  percent  of  patients  with  APS  had  concomitant  autoimmune
disease, and over half of those had concomitant SLE (Abu-Zeinah et al.,
2019). Women with obstetrical APS may have increased risk of hyperten-
sion  and  renal  failure  (Garcia  and  Erkan,  2018),  and  individuals  with
thrombotic  APS  suffer  long-term  disabilities  resulting  from  neurologic,
cardiac, and renal injury. The presence of SLE, history of arterial throm-
bosis, and organ damage can adversely affect health-related quality of life
for individuals with APS (Desnoyers et al., 2020). Pain, fatigue, concerns
about  family  planning,  and  medication  unpredictability  can  also  take  a
toll on the mental health of individuals with APS (Chighizola et al., 2021;
Desnoyers et al., 2020). Death can result from kidney, brain, or cardiopul-
monary thromboses, including heart valve disease and thrombotic micro-
angiopathy occurring either separately or concomitantly, as in CAPS.

Economic Impact

Data on the economic impact of APS are lacking. Direct costs of care
delivery  include  frequent  physician  visits,  emergency  room  visits,  hos-
pitalizations,  anticoagulant  medication,  and  laboratory  costs  for  close
medication monitoring. Studies have found that impaired work produc-
tivity adds to the indirect costs of APS (Chighizola et al., 2021). However,
quantitative data for the direct and indirect costs of APS are not available.

Risk Factors and Etiology

Other than family history, research has not identified risk factors for
APS.  The  frequent  observation  (Garcia  and  Erkan,  2018)  that  infections
trigger transient antiphospholipid antibodies points to an environmental
cause, perhaps characterized by an abnormal response to exposure. Many
infections,  including  syphilis,  leprosy,  and  COVID-19,  induce  antiphos-
pholipid antibodies transiently, though it is not yet clear whether infec-
tion-induced  antibodies  are  pathogenic  (Asherson  and  Cervera,  2003b;
Ribeiro et al., 2019; Talotta and Robertson, 2021). Antiphospholipid anti-
bodies persist over long periods of time.

Research suggests a genetic susceptibility for APS but has yet to define
what that susceptibility might be (Gavriș et al., 2021; Lopez-Pedrera et al.,
2019).  Immobility,  infection,  smoking,  and  withdrawal  of  anticoagulant
medication  each  can  trigger  thrombotic  episodes  (Cundiff,  2008;  Johns
Hopkins Medicine, n.d.), and microbiomic or other environmental factors
may trigger APS in susceptible persons (Martirosyan et al., 2019; Ruff et

116

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

al.,  2019).  Antiphospholipid  antibody,  specifically  lupus  inhibitor,  and
pre-existing renal dysfunction predispose women to obstetric complica-
tions. Between thrombotic or obstetric episodes, people with APS do not
have abnormal markers of inflammation and are mostly asymptomatic,
though  a  small  proportion  of  those  with  APS  have  ongoing  cutaneous
vasculitis or thrombocytopenia. Withdrawal of therapeutic anticoagula-
tion, infection, and trauma can trigger CAPS.

Diagnostic Tools

By  definition,  people  with  APS  must  have  persistent  moderate-to-
high  titer  immunoglobulin  G  (IgG)  and/or  immunoglobulin  M  (IgM)
anticardiolipin, anti-beta-2-glycoprotein I, or lupus inhibitor antibodies,
primarily of IgG isotype. These antibodies are sensitive for APS but not
specific; many individuals with these antibodies are healthy or have alter-
nate explanations for their presence (Gkrouzman et al., 2021; Misasi et al.,
2015).

A  classification  criteria  diagnosis  of  APS  requires  both  a  compat-
ible  clinical  event  such  as  pregnancy  loss  or  thrombosis,  and  because
infection-induced  antibodies  are  usually  transient,  persistent  high-titer
anticardiolipin,  anti-beta-2-glycoprotein  I,  or  lupus  inhibitor  antibod-
ies.  Research  has  found  other  related  autoantibodies  that  have  not  yet
received official endorsement as biomarkers for APS, primarily because
worldwide standards are not yet available. Individuals who do not meet
criteria  can  nonetheless  receive  an  APS  diagnosis  if  they  show  atypi-
cal features, such as livedo racemosa, microvascular thrombosis, or Lib-
man-Sacks endocarditis, together with positive serology. People who are
acutely  ill,  specifically  those  with  CAPS,  can  be  diagnosed  and  treated
without demonstrating that antibodies are persistent.

In patients with APS, a positive lupus inhibitor test has a high pre-
dictive  value  for  pregnancy  loss  (Yelnik  et  al.,  2016),  and  a  global  anti-
phospholipid  syndrome  score  (GAPSS)  has  a  high  predictive  value  for
thrombosis (Zuily et al., 2015).

Treatments and Prospects for Cures

Treatments  for  APS  are  based  more  on  expert  consensus  than  on
clinical trial data and include aspirin, hydroxychloroquine, heparin and
warfarin  for  acute  thromboses,  and  heparin  for  pregnancies  in  women
with prior pregnancy complications (Garcia and Erkan, 2018). Since most
women  with  obstetric  APS  do  not  develop  future  thromboses,  antico-
agulation can be discontinued a few months postpartum. Treatment for
thrombotic APS is usually lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin.

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

117

Hydroxychloroquine may improve outcomes in both thrombotic and
obstetric  APS  (Garcia  and  Erkan,  2018;  Sciascia  et  al.,  2016).  Although
hydroxychloroquine may reduce the risk of thrombosis in patients with
SLE, its efficacy is not yet proven for patients with APS who do not have
SLE (Garcia and Erkan, 2018). Based on small prospective studies, indi-
viduals  with  atypical  features  such  as  leg  ulcers,  endocarditis,  or  neu-
rologic  or  renal  disease  may  benefit  from  use  of  rituximab  (Garcia  and
Erkan, 2018). Researchers are also investigating anticomplement therapies
such as eculizumab and endothelial protective therapy with statins (Gar-
cia and Erkan, 2018). Antiphospholipid antibodies disappear over years in
some people with APS, suggesting the possibility of withdrawal of antico-
agulation for some patients. Research suggests that direct oral anticoagu-
lants may be useful in the treatment of some mild and/or atypical APS
patients,  that  is,  those  without  thromboses  or  pregnancy  losses.  Direct
oral  anticoagulants  are  not  recommended  for  higher  risk APS  patients,
that is, patients who are pregnant; have histories of arterial or small ves-
sel thromboses; or have triple positive antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus
anticoagulant, aCL, and anti-ß2GPI antibodies) (Dufrost et al., 2020).

Animal Models

No  spontaneous  animal  models  of  APS  exist.  Passively  acquired
antiphospholipid antibodies cause pregnancy loss and induce thrombo-
sis; similarly in vitro studies on platelets, endothelial cells, and leukocytes
suggest  that  autoimmune  antiphospholipid  antibodies  are  not  second-
ary events but are directly pathogenic (Gandhi et al., 2021). There is no
available infection-induced animal model of APS (Asherson and Cervera,
2003a; Garcia and Erkan, 2018). Discovery of such models would improve
understanding of APS mechanisms.

Research Progress and Gaps

Epidemiologic data for APS are unavailable. Research has not identi-
fied the circumstances that trigger transition from autoantibody negative
to positive or antibody positive to clinical APS, nor has it identified the
triggers  for  flares  in  people  who  are  clinically  quiescent.  Research  gaps
include  the  sources  of  the  autoantibodies,  evidence  that  the  currently
demonstrated autoantibodies are the primary actors, triggers for events,
and the mechanisms by which the illnesses progresses. The interrelation-
ship of APS with conditions such as NPSLE poses an additional level of
complexity and challenges for research. Recent advances in epidemiology,
genetics,  and  cell  and  cytokine  biology  promise  progress  in  this  area.
Endothelial  injury  is  a  new  area  of  exploration,  especially  since  there

118

seem to be clear links between COVID-19 infection and the inflammatory
and immunological injury seen in SLE and APS (Vlachoyiannopoulos et
al.,  2020;  Winchester  et  al.,  2021).  Proposed  treatment  paradigms  need
confirmation with controlled clinical trials, and long-term prognosis data
are  needed.  An  international  voluntary  consortium  (APS  ACTION)  is
assembling worldwide data from clinics specializing in APS (Erkan et al.,
2021). Additionally, quantitative data for the direct and indirect costs of
APS are needed to determine the economic impact of the disease.

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

Rheumatoid  arthritis  is  a  complex  chronic  disease  characterized  by
joint  inflammation,  pain,  swelling,  and  damage  as  well  as  by  a  variety
of effects seen in the skin, lung and cardiovascular systems. Other gen-
eralized  symptoms  include  fatigue  and  weight  loss.  Like  many  other
autoimmune  diseases,  rheumatoid  arthritis  is  characterized  by  periods
of flares and remission, with long-term consequences including the sys-
temic effects of the disease as well as complications from long-term drug
therapies.

tis can be found in Box 3-4.

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

Complications  and  other  conditions  associated  with  rheumatoid
arthritis stem in large part from the role that chronic inflammation plays
in this disease. Chronic inflammation increases the risk of developing ath-
erosclerosis, leading to strokes and myocardial infarction, and the risk of
developing pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease (Kim and Suh,
2020; Lindhardsen et al., 2011). The chronic inflammation associated with
rheumatoid arthritis can also damage the skin and eyes (Chua-Aguilera
et al., 2017; Murray and Rauz, 2016). An increased risk of different types
of lymphoma (Anderson et al., 2009) and of central or peripheral neuro-
logical system damage (Kaeley et al., 2019; Ramos-Remus et al., 2012) are
also  seen  in  people  with  rheumatoid  arthritis.  The  results  can  be  broad
ranged.  For  example,  significant  morbidity,  and  in  some  cases,  reduced
life span, have been associated with central and peripheral neurological
damage. Such damage may produce symptoms ranging from numbness
in the hand to muscle weakness in all four limbs (quadripesis) as well as
sudden death (Ramos-Remus et al., 2012).

Mortality resulting from cardiovascular and respiratory disease con-
tribute to the increased overall mortality risk in people with rheumatoid
arthritis  (England  et  al.,  2016;  Yoshida  et  al.,  2021).  Studies  have  also
found an increased risk of other autoimmune diseases, specifically type
1 diabetes, IBD, and thyroiditis, in people with rheumatoid arthritis, as
well as an inverse association between rheumatoid arthritis and multiple


120

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

sclerosis (Somers et al., 2009). In addition, an individual may have a form
of disease that shares features of both rheumatoid arthritis and SLE, also
known as “rhupus”(Antonini et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2017; Lockshin et al.,
2015),  or  one  that  shares  features  with  Sjögren’s  disease  (Zhang  et  al.,
2020). The long-term use of immune-suppressing medications increases
the risk of infections (Kim and Suh, 2020).

The impact of rheumatoid arthritis on quality of life can be significant.
For example, depression is common and is a key component that disease
management should address (Matcham et al., 2013).

Economic Impact

The economic impact of rheumatoid arthritis is significant. One com-
prehensive analysis estimated a total cost of $47.6 billion (in 2005 dollars),
based on estimates of direct health care costs ($8.4 billion), indirect costs
of  lost  wages  productivity,  job  turnover,  and  required  household  help
($19.3  billion),  intangible  costs  relating  to  quality-of-life  changes  ($10.3
billion), and premature mortality ($9.6 billion) (Birnbaum et al., 2010).

The  measurement  of  indirect  costs  is  important  given  a  decreasing
trend in inpatient costs; this was due to improvement of clinical outcomes
by  biologic  and  targeted  synthetic  disease-modifying  antirheumatic
drugs. A decreasing trend in inpatient costs chronologically suggested a
cost shift in other components of direct costs. Indirect costs still contrib-
uted a considerable proportion of total costs, with work disability being
the main cost component. Economic analyses that do not incorporate or
appropriately measure indirect costs will underestimate the full economic
impact of rheumatoid arthritis (Hsieh et al., 2020).

A retrospective  study  of  employed  individuals  (18–65)  using  1996–
2006 US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data estimated national indi-
rect  costs  of  rheumatoid  arthritis-related  absenteeism  as  $252  million
annually.  The  study  concluded  that  there  is  a  higher  probability  that
individuals with rheumatoid arthritis will miss work and workdays than
those without rheumatoid arthritis (Gunnarsson et al., 2015).

Risk Factors and Etiology

The  autoantibodies  seen  most  commonly  in  people  with  rheuma-
toid  arthritis  are  rheumatoid  factor  and  anti-citrullinated  protein/pep-
tide  antibodies  (van  Delft  and  Huizinga,  2020).  In  synovial  fluid,  these
autoantibodies may contribute to activation of the inflammatory immune
response and the resulting tissue damage.

One of the most well-established risk factors for rheumatoid arthri-
tis  is  cigarette  smoking  (Liu  et  al.,  2019).  This  elevated  risk,  seen  most

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

121

strongly and consistently in people with anti-citrullinated protein/peptide
antibodies, exhibits a positive dose–response with duration and amount
smoked  in  pack-years.  Smoking cessation can  delay or  prevent develop-
ment  of  rheumatoid  arthritis.  Studies  have  elucidated  the  interaction
between smoking and  the  HLA-DR  shared  haplotype  specific  gene  and
the   mechanisms   through   which   smoking-mediated   immune   responses
in  the  lung lead  to  autoantibody formation  and  immune  activation,  and
ultimately damage  and  destruction  of  joints  and  other  tissues  (Stolt et al.,
2010).   This   research   has   produced   important  insights   into   the   systemic
effects  that  can  be  produced  by  the  immune  responses  to  respiratory
exposures  in  the  lung (Catrina  et al.,  2014).

Research has also identified similar mechanisms with other respirable
exposures, including silica and asbestos (Klareskog et al., 2020). Investi-
gators have examined occupational silica exposure in numerous studies
and found a strong and robust association and evidence of dose–response
with  various  measures  of  increasing  exposure. A 2020  meta-analysis  of
data  from  15  studies  found  that  the  overall  odds  ratio  for  occupational
silica  exposure  and  risk  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  was  2.59  (Mehri  et  al.,
2020).  This  analysis  did  not  include  the  most  recent  study  (Boudigaard
et al., 2021) or several early studies (Brown et al., 1997; Rosenman et al.,
1999), each of which provide additional support for the overall strength
of the evidence. Silica induces apoptosis of macrophages, exposing intra-
cellular  self-antigens  to  a  dysregulated  immune  response  that  involves
increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, B-cell activation, and
increased production of autoantibodies (Cooper et al., 2008).

Multiple  studies  have  examined  three  risk  factors—breastfeeding,
alcohol consumption, and obesity—and yielded relatively robust and con-
sistent findings.  Breastfeeding appears  to  be  a  protective  factor,  as  there
is  an  inverse,  dose-dependent  association  between  women  who  have
breastfed  and  rheumatoid  arthritis,  with  a  greater  protective  effect seen
with a  longer  length  of  lactation  (Chen et al.,  2015).  In a  meta-analysis  of
six studies,  the  combined  odds  ratio  was  0.68  for  ever  breastfeeding,  0.78
for   1   to   12   months   of   breastfeeding,   and   0.58   for   more   than  12   months
of   breastfeeding  versus   never   breastfeeding  (Chen   et  al.,   2015).  Alcohol
consumption and rheumatoid arthritis also shows an inverse association,
with  dose–response   following  a   U-shaped   curve   (Maxwell   et  al.,   2010;
Scott et al., 2013). Higher body mass index is associated with an increasing
risk of rheumatoid arthritis, with an estimated odds ratio of 1.15 and 1.31
for  the  overweight and  obese  categories,  respectively (Qin et al.,  2015).

Proinflammatory dietary factors, such as red meat and sugar-sweet-
ened beverages, are associated with increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis,
whereas anti-inflammatory diets, fish, and omega-3 fatty acid supplements

122

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

are associated with decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis autoimmunity
and rheumatoid arthritis, although not consistently (Benito-Garcia et al.,
2007; Di Giuseppe et al., 2014a,b; Gan et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2014, 2017;
Pattison et al., 2004; Sparks et al., 2019a,b).

The findings from studies of oral contraceptive use are mixed (Qi et
al., 2014). Studies of infectious agents are few in number, but work exam-
ining  Porphyromonas  gingivalis,  a  bacteria  associated  with  periodontitis,
provides insights into possible mechanisms relating to production of anti-
citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (Klareskog et al., 2020). EBV has
also been associated with development of rheumatoid arthritis. Persons
with  rheumatoid  arthritis  have  high  titers  of  EBV  antibodies  and  high
levels of EBV-infected B cells, which indicate the control of EBV infection
is impeded (Balandraud and Roudier, 2018).

Studies examining the development of autoantibodies prior to devel-
opment  of  symptomatic  disease  have  advanced  the  understanding  of
the  etiology  of  rheumatoid  arthritis.  Research  conducted  over  the  past
20  years  has  included  multiple  isotypes  of  rheumatoid  factor  and  anti-
citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies (Deane and Holers, 2021). Using
blood banks and other sources of stored sera, retrospective and prospec-
tive studies have demonstrated the presence of these autoantibodies five
or more years before clinical presentation of disease (Nielen et al., 2004).
The  highest  positive  predictive  values  occur  with  the  presence  of  two
or  more  autoantibodies  (Deane  and  Holers,  2021).  These  observations
provide the opportunity to develop strategies to prevent the progression
from a preclinical to symptomatic disease. At a population level, reducing
occupational exposure to respirable silica and discouraging smoking are
two steps that could reduce the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis. Addi-
tional research is needed to determine whether the permissible exposure
limits designed to reduce the risk of silicosis will also provide protection
for rheumatoid arthritis and other systemic autoimmune diseases.

Diagnostic Tools

Many  symptoms  of  early  rheumatoid  arthritis,  such  as  fatigue  and
low-grade  fever,  are  nonspecific.  The  presence  of  swelling  and  stiffness
in multiple joints is characteristic of the disease, and testing for rheuma-
toid  factor,  anti-citrullinated  protein/peptide  antibodies,  and  measures
of inflammation, including C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimenta-
tion rate, are a cornerstone of classification criteria (Aletaha et al., 2010).

Treatments and Prospects for Cures

Maximizing the length of remission periods and decreasing therapy
side effects and complications, rather than achieving a cure, are the basis
for  therapeutic  advances.  Treatment  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  is  aimed  at
reducing symptoms, improving function and quality of life, and prevent-
ing  progression  and  damage  to  the  affected  areas  and  other  long-term
complications.  Individuals  with  rheumatoid  arthritis  can  reduce  their
medications when they achieve sustained improvements in disease activ-
ity.  Treatment  options  include  general  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory
drugs, and immune-suppressant disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.
The latter group includes conventional or traditional agents such as meth-
otrexate and leflunomide, biologics such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
inhibitors and rituximab, and Janus kinase inhibitors targeted at specific
immune  pathways.  Multiple  organizations,  including  the ACR  and  the
European  Alliance  of  Associations  for  Rheumatology,  have  established
and updated treatment guidelines (Crofford, 2013; Fraenkel et al., 2021;
Singh et al., 2016; Smolen et al., 2020).

Animal Models

Researchers have developed numerous animal models, primarily in
mice  and  rats,  that  demonstrate  rheumatoid  arthritis  features  includ-
ing synovial hyperplasia, cartilage damage, bone erosion, and increased
production  of  key  proinflammatory  cytokines  involved  in  this  disease,
such  as  TNFα,  interferons,  and  several  interleukins  (Choudhary  et  al.,
2018).  Researchers  developing  one  of  the  earliest  models  in  the  1940s
used  complete  Freund’s  adjuvant,  a  mixture  of  mineral  oils,  heat-killed
mycobacteria, and emulsifying agent. Collagen is another common induc-
ing agent, either with complete or incomplete Freund’s adjuvant, which
omits mycobacterium. The choice of inducing agent, adjuvant, strain, and
species  enables  investigators  to  examine  different  mechanisms,  stages,
and features of the disease. Mice expressing the human TNF gene (Keffer
et al., 1991), and more recently, transgenic and knockout mouse models
such as K/BxN mice (Monach et al., 2008) enable examination of the role
of specific genes in inflammatory response.

Research Progress and Gaps

Important  developments  in  rheumatoid  arthritis  over  the  past  30
years  include  understanding  the  heterogeneity  of  the  disease  and  the
usefulness  of  developing  classification  criteria  to  reflect  the  variabil-
ity  in  phenotypes  and  biomarkers.  In  addition,  researchers  have  made

124

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

considerable progress in developing a wider variety of treatment options
based  on  specific  immune  pathways,  coexisting  illness,  and  individual
patient preferences.

Questions pertaining to the development of the disease offer oppor-
tunities  for  research  that  could  lead  to  prevention  and  earlier  interven-
tions. Studies examining the transition from an asymptomatic preclinical
state in which rheumatoid arthritis-specific autoantibodies are present to
symptomatic disease are needed. These studies would enable investiga-
tion  of  various  environmental  factors,  and  gene–environment  interac-
tions, associated with the development of subsets of disease defined by
serology. It is also important to understand the role of these factors and
interactions in disease progression and development of flares. The role of
respiratory exposures and links between immune response in the lung to
inflammation and pathology induced in other tissues is another promis-
ing avenue of research. Epidemiologically, the signal of recent temporal
increases in incidence after years of apparent declines stresses the impor-
tance  of  elucidating  environmental  and  modifiable  risk  factors  and  the
need for continued public health surveillance for rheumatoid arthritis.

PSORIASIS

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated systemic inflammatory disease that
manifests as chronic inflammatory effects in skin and joints (Reich, 2012).
Psoriasis  can  affect  any  area  of  the  skin  but  most  typically  affects  the
extensor surfaces of the forearms and shins, the peri-anal, peri-umbilical
and  retro-auricular  regions,  and  the  scalp  (Boehncke  and  Schön,  2015),
with  up  to  80  percent  of  people  having  scalp  involvement  (Ortonne  et
al., 2009). Multiple variants of psoriasis exist, including plaque psoriasis,
guttate psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, and pustular psoriasis. Chronic
plaque psoriasis, also known as psoriasis vulgaris, accounts for 90 percent
of psoriasis cases. Lesions are typified by sharply demarcated erythema-
tous plaques that are covered by plates, or lamella, of silvery scales. The
plaques can be few in number or can extend across large areas of the body.
Erythroderma is a severe form of psoriasis that covers the entire body and
can be life-threatening as a result of electrolyte disturbances and shedding
of the outer layer of skin, known as desquamation, that can occur (Arm-
strong and Read, 2020; Boehncke and Schön, 2015).

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

Psoriatic arthritis is a common co-occurring autoimmune disease with
psoriasis. An  estimated  5  to  40  percent  of  those  with  psoriasis  develop
psoriatic arthritis—characterized by stiffness, pain, and swelling of joints
that can eventually lead to debilitating joint destruction—at some point
in their lives (Henes et al., 2014; Mease and Goffe, 2005). Psoriasis either
precedes or occurs at the same time as psoriatic arthritis in 85 percent of
those with psoriasis (Armstrong and Read, 2020).

People  with  psoriasis,  particularly  its  severe  forms,  have  increased
risk  of  developing  cardiometabolic  health  conditions  including  type  2
diabetes, metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, and stroke (Arm-
strong  et  al.,  2015;  Armstrong  and  Read,  2020).  Likely  owing  to  shar-
ing genetic susceptibility loci on chromosome 16q with Crohn’s disease,
people with psoriasis have a four times greater prevalence of autoimmune
IBD,  including  Crohn’s  disease  and  ulcerative  colitis,  than  the  general
population (Eppinga et al., 2017; Karason et al., 2003).

Several  studies  have  documented  linkages  between  psoriasis  and
depression,  anxiety,  and  suicidal  ideation  (Dalgard  et  al.,  2015;  Dow-
latshahi et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2017). Psoriasis has a significant physical

126

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

and psychological effect, similar to that of other skin lesions, and with a
comparable effect on quality of life as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or
depression (Rapp et al., 1999). People with psoriasis may experience pain,
itchy skin, and bleeding, and may experience stigma from others (Kimball
et al., 2005).

Economic Impact

A 2015 study estimated the total cost of psoriasis in the United States
to  be  $35.2  billion,  with  35  percent,  34  percent,  and  32  percent  of  the
costs  attributed  to  direct  health  care  costs,  reduced  health-related  qual-
ity  of  life,  and  decreased  work-related  productivity  losses,  respectively
(Vanderpuye-Orgle et al., 2015).

Risk Factors and Etiology

Dysregulated interactions between innate and adaptive components
of the immune system with cutaneous cells cause the skin lesions char-
acteristic of psoriasis (Boehncke and Schön, 2015), though little is known
about  antibodies  or  antigens  involved  in  the  disease.  Genetic,  environ-
mental,  and  behavioral  factors  have  been  implicated  in  the  etiology  of
psoriasis, with genetic factors having the largest contribution to psoriasis
development  (Griffiths  et  al.,  2021;  Tsoi  et  al.,  2017).  In  fact,  research  in
the early 1970s first identified a higher incidence of psoriasis in first- and
second-degree relatives of individuals who develop psoriasis compared
with the general public. In addition, identical twins are up to three times
more likely to share a diagnosis of psoriasis than fraternal twins (Alsho-
baili et al., 2010; Farber and Nall, 1974).

Numerous studies have identified multiple genes and chromosomal
regions  that  increase  the  risk  of  developing  psoriasis  (Tiilikainen  et  al.,
1980; Tsoi et al., 2017). Research also suggests that genetic factors influ-
ence  disease  severity.  Individuals  with  earlier  onset  psoriasis  are  more
likely  to  have  a  family  history  of  the  disease  and  tend  to  experience  a
more severe disease course compared with those who develop psoriasis
later in life (Henseler and Christophers, 1985). Research has yet to identify
external triggers for psoriasis for most instances of the disease. For indi-
viduals with a family history of psoriasis, and thus a presumed genetic
susceptibility, triggering factors may include trauma to or irritation of the
skin, including scratching, piercing, and sunburn; infections, particularly
streptococcal upper respiratory infections in children (Besgen et al., 2010;
Rasmussen, 1986); cigarette smoking (Armstrong et al., 2015; Naldi, 2016);
certain  medications,  including  interferon,  lithium,  and  antimalarials

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

127

(Armstrong and Read, 2020; Boehncke and Schön, 2015); and metabolic
and psychological stress (Armstrong et al., 2015; Rigas et al., 2019).

Diagnostic Tools

Clinical findings and family history are the primary diagnostic indi-
cators of psoriasis. Clinicians will conduct a full body exam, paying par-
ticular attention to the skin and nails, and rely on a scoring system, such
as  the  Psoriasis  Global  Assessment  scale,  Psoriasis  Area  and  Severity
Index,  or  the  Lattice  System  Physician’s  Global Assessment  instrument
(Langley  and  Ellis,  2004),  to  diagnose  psoriasis  and  assess  its  severity,
though they may also order a skin biopsy for atypical presentations of the
disease (Armstrong and Read, 2020). Confounding conditions can include
other inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic conditions such as atopic
dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, syphilis, and cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma.

Treatments and Prospects for Cures

Treatment options for psoriasis are based on the severity of the dis-
ease  and  whether  the  individual  also  has  psoriatic  arthritis.  Corticoste-
roids, vitamin D analogs, calcineurin inhibitors, keratolytics, and targeted
phototherapy are common options for mild psoriasis affecting less than 3
to 5 percent of the body surface area (Armstrong and Read, 2020). A meta-
analysis of published research found that corticosteroids combined with
vitamin D3 improves psoriasis of the scalp, but further research is needed
to  inform  safety  and  long-term  maintenance  treatment  (Mason  et  al.,
2013). Recommended treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis include
biologics  and  oral  agents,  including  methotrexate,  apremilast,  acitretin,
and  cyclosporine,  combined  with  phototherapy  (Martin  et  al.,  2019).
While  oral  agents  were  previously  the  treatment  of  choice  for  plaque
psoriasis,  TNF  inhibitors,  IL-12/23  inhibitor,  IL-17  inhibitors,  and  IL-23
inhibitors  since  have  proven  to  be  more  effective  treatments  (Feldman,
2021). FDA has also approved biological agents such as these for treating
psoriatic arthritis (Armstrong and Read, 2020). However, a large study of
patients with psoriasis who were treated with systemic therapies found
that those treated with biologics were at a significantly increased risk for
serious infections, particularly skin and soft tissue infections, compared
with patients not undergoing biologics therapy (Dobry et al., 2017). One
recent study found that Black individuals were less likely to receive new
therapies for psoriasis (Bell et al., 2020).

128

Animal Models

There are few animal models for studying the etiology of psoriasis.
Developing new diagnostics and treatments for psoriasis would benefit
from developing highly predictive animal models (Bocheńska et al., 2017).

Research Progress and Gaps

Over the past decade, there have been considerable advances in the
understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and in the treatment of its
heterogeneous manifestations. In particular, biologics for the treatment of
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis have been a significant therapeutic
advancement. Remaining research gaps include a need for further under-
standing  of  the  mechanistic  links  between  psoriasis,  other  autoimmune
diseases, and comorbid diseases (Boehncke and Schön, 2015). There exists
a particular gap in the early identification of psoriatic arthritis. A deeper
understanding  of  environmental  triggers  for  psoriasis  is  also  needed.
Epidemiologic  data  across  the  life  course  in  persons  with  psoriasis  is
limited, as is research addressing patient-centered personalized care for
each  individual  living  with  the  disease.  Studies  of  the  socioeconomic
impact of psoriasis are also lacking (Boehncke and Schön, 2015). As noted

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE

Ulcerative  colitis  and  Crohn’s  disease  are  two  forms  of  the  chronic
idiopathic  inflammatory  disorder  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  known  as
IBD. The main symptoms of ulcerative colitis, which damages the muco-
sal layer of the rectum and colon, are diarrhea, rectal bleeding, passage
of mucus, crampy abdominal pain, and a feeling that a bowel movement
is imminent even though the bowels are empty. In most cases, symptoms
are present for weeks to months before an individual seeks medical atten-
tion, though acute cases can occur. The extent of the disease—how much
of the colon is affected—correlates with the severity of these symptoms.
Ulcerative  colitis  almost  always  involves  the  rectum  and  often  extends
proximally to involve additional areas of the colon (Rubin et al., 2019).

Crohn’s disease involves the entire thickness of the wall of any part
of the gastrointestinal tract rather than just the mucosal layer of the colon
and bowel, and it usually presents as acute or chronic bowel inflammation.
Localized inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and the formation of

fistula tracts that can lead to fibrosis and narrowing of the intestines are
two main characteristics of Crohn’s disease. Population-based conducted
in  Norway  and  Minnesota  suggest  that  “Crohn’s  disease  presents  with
ileal, ileocolonic, or colonic disease in roughly one-third of patients each,
and  that  only  a  small  minority  of  patients  (6–14  percent)  will  have  a
change in disease location over time” (Lichtenstein et al., 2018).

The inflammatory process in Crohn’s disease proceeds along one of
two pathways, one leading to a pattern of obstructive fibrosis, the other
in a pattern of penetrating fistulas. The treatment and prognosis differs
for each of these patterns. Crohn’s disease, unlike ulcerative colitis, rarely
affects  the  rectum  (Lichtenstein  et  al.,  2018),  although  a  third  of  cases
involve the area around the anus. Most often Crohn’s disease is patchy—it
skips areas in the diseased intestine, whereas ulcerative colitis affects con-
tinuous regions—and in rare cases, Crohn’s disease can involve the liver
and pancreas (Fousekis et al., 2018; Lichtenstein et al., 2018).

(Shivashankar  et  al.,  2017)

•	  The highest incidence of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease occurs in

the second to fourth decades, and particularly in the 20–29 age range
Incidence of IBD is rising in developing countries and urban areas (Benchimol

- Prevalence  in  children  under  age  17  increased  from  33  per  100,000  in  2007

to  77  per  100,000  in  2016  (Ye  et  al.,  2020)

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

IBD can co-occur with other autoimmune diseases including primary
biliary cholangitis and celiac disease (Koulentaki et al., 1999; Oxford et al.,
2013). Complications include an increased risk of depression and anxiety
(Byrne et al., 2017), cardiovascular disease, stroke, and maternal and fetal
complications (Agrawal et al., 2021b; Card et al., 2021; Chen and Wang,
2021; Choi et al., 2019; Odufalu et al., 2021). There is an increased risk of
colon  cancer  in  individuals  with  Crohn’s  disease  or  ulcerative  colitis  in
whom one-third or more of the colon is involved (Friedman et al., 2001,
2008).  With  immunosuppressive  treatment,  there  is  an  increased  risk  of
lymphoma, melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers, and infections (Chu-
pin et al., 2020; Long et al., 2012; Mill and Lawrance, 2014).

Up to one-third of patients with IBD have at least one extraintestinal
disease manifestation, which can include rheumatologic disorders, meta-
bolic bone disorders, dermatologic disorders, and urologic disorders (Bar-
berio et al., 2021; Rogler et al., 2021; Sange et al., 2021; Shah et al., 2021).

Economic Impact

One study has estimated the total lifetime cost of IBD, as well as the
difference  between  the  costs  associated  with  patients  with  IBD  versus
matched controls, using the Truven Health MarketScan insurance claims
database for the period 2008 to 20153 (Lichtenstein et al., 2020). Compared
with  matched  controls,  patients  with  Crohn’s  disease  diagnosed  at  any
age incurred $416,352 in additional costs. For those diagnosed from birth
to age 11, the additional costs totaled over the lifetime averaged $707,111,
and those diagnosed at age 70 or older incurred an average of $177,614
in  additional  costs  over  their  lifetime.  The  average  total  lifetime  cost
for  patients  of  all  ages  was  $622,056–$273,056  for  outpatient  expenses,
$164,298 for inpatient services, $163,722 in pharmacy billings, and $20,979
for emergency department visits.

Compared  with  matched  controls,  patients  with  ulcerative  colitis
diagnosed  at  any  age  incurred  $230,102  in  additional  costs  over  their
lifetimes. For those diagnosed from birth to age 11, the additional costs
totaled over the lifetime averaged $369,955, and those diagnosed at age 70
or older incurred an average of $132,396 in additional costs over their life-
time. The average total lifetime cost for patients of all ages was $405,496–
$163,670 for outpatient expenses, $123,190 for inpatient services, $105,142
in pharmacy billings, and $13,493 for emergency department visits. Taken
together, individuals with IBD will incur a total of $875 billion in lifetime

costs, $498 billion for those with Crohn’s disease and $377 billion for those
with ulcerative colitis.

Risk Factors and Etiology

Epidemiologic studies have identified a variety of potential risks fac-
tors for developing IBD. For example, infectious gastroenteritis increases
the risk of developing IBD by two- to three-fold (Acheson and Truelove,
1961; Barclay et al., 2009; Klement et al., 2004; Ng et al., 2015). In general,
research has found associations between increased risk of developing IBD
and low intake of fiber (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2011) and
high intake of sweetened beverages (Racine et al., 2016); animal proteins,
particularly red and processed meat; total fats; and polyunsaturated fatty
acids, including both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids (Hou et al., 2011;
Jantchou et al., 2010; Lewis and Abreu, 2017). The risk of being diagnosed
with IBD before the ages of 10 and 20 years is 3 times and 1.6 times higher,
respectively, for individuals who experience an infection during the first
year  of  life  (Bernstein  et  al.,  2019).  Sleep  disruption  has  been  shown
to  increase  both  the  incidence  and  relapse  of  IBD  (Ballesio  et  al.,  2021;
Beilman et al., 2020). Other risk factors include use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory  medications,  urbanization,  and  environmental  pollution.
Breastfeeding  appears  to  be  a  protective  factor  for  IBD  development  in
children, with a longer period of breastfeeding providing greater protec-
tion (Barclay et al., 2009; Klement et al., 2004; Ng et al., 2015). While smok-
ing is associated with a decreased risk of ulcerative colitis irrespective of
race or ethnicity, it is associated with an increased risk of Crohn’s disease
in non-Jewish White smokers (Piovani et al., 2021).

Research suggests that IBD arises because of a dysregulated response
to commensal microbes within the intestine, though it is also affected by
a complex interplay of host genetic risk, aberrant immune responses, and
environmental factors. The mucosal immune system is altered in IBD and
is  characterized  by  an  abundance  of  proinflammatory  mediators  from
cells associated with adaptive immunity, such as T helper cells, and innate
immunity,  including  macrophages  and  dendritic  cells,  which  occur  in
increased numbers in mucosa affected by IBD. There is evidence that non-
immune cells, such as epithelial and stromal cells, are also reprogrammed
in  IBD  and  play  a  significant  role  in  the  propagation  of  dysregulated
immune  responses.  Historic  paradigms  regarding  differential  T  helper
cell  responses  in  Crohn’s  disease  versus  ulcerative  colitis  have  evolved
with  the  use  of  large-scale  and  multidimensional  immunophenotyping
of human tissue. The diseases seem to share many common immunologi-
cal features (Chang, 2020; Mitsialis et al., 2020; Peterson and Artis, 2014).

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

133

As mentioned above, a number of rare single genetic mutations have
been identified as the basis of susceptibility in up to 10 percent of cases
of infantile IBD or very-early-onset IBD, suggesting a simple monogenic
origin of the disease in these cases (Ouahed, 2021). More than 60 different
gene defects have been identified in patients with very-early-onset IBD by
whole exome sequencing. However, IBD in the majority of pediatric and
adult patients involve the interplay of multiple genes with other factors
(Nambu et al., 2021).

Diagnostic Tools

Clinicians  use  several  diagnostic  tools  to  assess  disease  activity  and
extent  in  IBD,  including  sigmoidoscopy  before  deciding  the  course  of
treatment for ulcerative colitis, and colonoscopy to determine the extent of
disease in patients who are not having an acute flare (Pabla and Schwartz,
2020).  Histology  can  provide  information  to  grade  activity  in  ulcerative
colitis,  though  histologic  features  change  more  slowly  than  clinical  fea-
tures.  There  are  also  a  number  of  abnormalities  in  Crohn’s  disease  that
show  up  in  laboratory  tests,  including  levels  of  erythrocyte  sedimenta-
tion  rate  and  C-reactive  protein,  as  well  as  hypoalbuminemia,  anemia,
and  leukocytosis  in  more  severe  cases  (Cappello  and  Morreale,  2016).
Levels  of  the  fecal  proteins  calprotectin  and  lactoferrin  can  distinguish
IBD from irritable bowel syndrome,4 determine whether ulcerative colitis
and  Crohn’s  disease  are  active,  and  detect  whether  Crohn’s  disease  has
returned  after  surgery  to  remove  the  diseased  portion  of  the  intestines
(Zhou et al., 2014). Studies have not found antibodies to be that useful in
diagnosing  IBD,  though  there  is  some  evidence  that  increased  levels  of
anti-Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  antibody  may  be  indicative  of  Crohn’s  dis-
ease  and  that  elevated  levels  of  perinuclear  antineutrophil  cytoplasmic
antibody  may  occur  more  frequently  in  people  with  ulcerative  colitis
(Mitsuyama et al., 2016). However, antibody levels tend to be relatively
insensitive to and nonspecific for IBD given that they are often elevated
in other autoimmune diseases, infections, and inflammatory conditions,
including those outside of the gastrointestinal tract (Kyriakidi et al., 2016;
MedlinePlus, 2021; Roozendaal and Kallenberg, 1999).

Treatments and Prospects for Cures

Initial  therapy  for  people  with  moderate  to  severe  Crohn’s  disease
and  ulcerative  colitis  usually  includes  biologic  and  small  molecule

4 Irritable bowel syndrome is the term for symptoms that occur when the contents of the

large intestine move too quickly or too slowly.

134

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

therapy,  with  the  goal  of  maintaining  remission  and  preventing  future
complications.  High-risk  people  with  ulcerative  colitis  who  are  more
likely to require biologics-based treatment include those with moderate
to  severe  disease,  steroid-dependent  or  steroid-refractory  disease,  and
refractory  inflammation   of   the  ileoanal   J   pouch.   High-risk  people   with
Crohn’s   disease   who   are   more   likely  to   require   biologics   include   those
who   are   younger   than   30   and   have   extensive  disease,   with   perianal   or
severe  rectal  disease  and/or  deep  ulcerations  in  the  colon  and  strictur-
ing  or   penetrating  disease   behavior.   The   current  goal   of   IBD   treatment
is  to  treat early in  the  disease  course,  treat aggressively with  top–down
biologics therapy, check  drug  and drug  metabolite levels, administer dual
therapy with immunomodulators  and  biologics  in appropriate  patients,
and aim for deep remission as assessed by endoscopy and histology. Stud-
ies  have  shown  that biologic  therapies  produce  marked  improvements  in
clinical  symptoms  and  allow  patients  with  IBD  to  enjoy a  better  quality
of  life  with less  disability,  as  well  as  fewer  hospitalizations  and  surgeries
(Al-Bawardy et al.,  2021;  Armuzzi  and  Liguori,  2021;  Singh  et al.,  2020).

Diet plays a significant role in shaping the gut microbiome, and one
theory holds that dietary components interact with the microbiome and
stimulate  a  mucosal  immune  response.  In  fact,  active  Crohn’s  disease
responds to exclusive enteral nutrition or bowel rest with total parenteral
nutrition (TPN), which have been shown to be as effective as glucocor-
ticoids  in  inducing  remission  but  are  not  as  effective  for  maintenance
therapy.  This  lends  further  support  to  the  theory  that  dietary  antigens
stimulate an immune response. In contrast with Crohn’s disease, elemen-
tal diets or TPN are not effective treatments for ulcerative colitis.

Dietary approaches as maintenance therapy in Crohn’s disease have
been  adapted  largely  from  findings  of  epidemiologic  studies;  however,
there  is  significant  heterogeneity  among  research  studies.  The  overall
dietary  approach  is  to  maximize  fiber  intake,  particularly  from  fruits
and vegetables, and to limit consumption of higher-risk foods. There are
several defined diets that generally adhere to these principles with some
variation.  These  diets  include  the  Mediterranean  diet  pattern,  Specific
Carbohydrate  Diet,  Semi-Vegetarian  Diet,  and  IBD  Anti-Inflammatory
Diet. However, much work remains to understand how diet might affect
disease risk and activity, research that may eventually lead to evidence-
based nutrition guidelines.

Therapies targeting specific cytokines, such as TNF, IL-12, and IL-23,
have revolutionized IBD treatment. Therapy targeting immune cell traf-
ficking to intestinal tissue has proven successful in IBD and shows con-
tinued promise. However, the cumulative repertoire of therapies for IBD
is  limited  and  many  people  with  the  condition  suffer  with  refractory
disease.

Animal Models

There  are  four  categories  of  animal  models  of  intestinal  inflamma-
tion—chemical, genetically engineered, cell transfer, and congenic—that
researchers use to study how IBD develops and explore new therapeutic
approaches  (Bamias  et  al.,  2017).  Chemical  models,  which  researchers
create by using harsh chemical to damage the colon, provide insight into
early repair mechanisms, but not for studying the inflammatory processes
active in IBD. Creating genetic engineering models involves either delet-
ing genes that control the production of one or more proteins they suspect
play a role in disease development or introducing mutations that lead to
overproduction  of  those  proteins.  Such  models  are  useful  for  studying
specific pathways in the inflammatory response, but not for studying the
complex interaction of different pathways that characterize both a normal
and abnormal immune response.

Cell  transfer  models  involve  injecting different subsets  of  T  cells  from
a   donor   into   specially  bred  mice  that  lack  adaptive  immunity  and   that
have  been  kept in germ-free  environments.  Researchers  use  cell  transfer
molecules to study the protective or pathogenic roles that specific types of
T cells play in mucosal immunity, but because the animals are immuno-
deficient, unlike  humans  with IBD,  the  insights  gained  from  these studies
may not apply fully to  IBD.  Congenic  models  develop  disease  spontane-
ously  as   a   result  of   specific   breeding,   genetic,   or   housing  backgrounds.
These models most closely recapitulate human disease, but they are hard
to   develop  and   the   most  complex  to   study.   Efforts   to   develop   safe   and
effective  treatments  for  IBD  could  benefit from  the  development of addi-
tional  animal  models.

Research Progress and Gaps

Researchers have made progress in many areas of IBD, particularly
in terms of developing effective biologic therapies and other therapeutic
approaches for IBD. There has been progress in diagnosis such as using
specialized MRI, computed tomography, video capsule technology, and
colonoscopic  evaluation.  There  have  also  been  advances  in  identifying
immunologic  and  environmental  factors  that  may  predispose  an  indi-
vidual  to  developing  IBD,  as  well  as  genetic  factors  involved  in  very-
early-onset IBD.

Research gaps for IBD include the need to establish a more complete
knowledge  of  disease  etiology  and  pathogenesis  and  the  influence  of
genetic predisposition and environmental factors on disease development
and phenotype. Research is also needed to identify how to prevent onset
of disease in a person with a strong familial risk. There is a large gap in

136

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

epidemiological data on IBD, including incidence and prevalence in the
United States and well-designed studies that would provide a better pic-
ture of disease risk in the U.S. population.

Among  the  key  needs  are  developing  better  biomarkers  to  monitor
disease  activity  and  determining  the  causes  of  disease  flares  and  how
to prevent them. Identifying the specific biological pathways that result
in  the  observable  characteristics  and  symptoms  of  IBD  would  enable
matching effective medications to specific IBD manifestations. In addition,
evaluating the efficacy of alternative and complementary therapies such
as  diet,  stress-reduction,  and  nutritional  supplements  would  represent
an advance. Other useful research areas assess the safety of administer-
ing biologics and the thiopurine family of immunosuppressive drugs to
individuals with IBD—during pregnancy in mothers and prior to concep-
tion in fathers—as well as determining the long-term health effects to the
offspring (Kanis et al., 2017). Creating new animal models that define the
safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic strategies for IBD could support
advances in understanding of the disease.

CELIAC DISEASE

Chronic  inflammation  of  the  intestines,  caused  by  the  immune  sys-
tem’s  reaction  to  dietary  gluten,  is  the  characteristic  feature  of  celiac
disease,  sometimes  called  celiac  sprue  or  gluten-sensitive  enteropathy.
Over time, this immune response destroys the intestinal mucosa, which
hampers absorption of nutrients from the intestines and can cause diar-
rhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating, constipation, and anemia. In children,
malabsorption can affect growth and development (Lebwohl et al., 2018).
In addition, the intestinal damage that arises in celiac disease can result
in serious complications, described further below (Mayo Clinic, 2021a).

with other racial and ethnic groups (Mardini et al., 2015).

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

Individuals  with  celiac  disease  typically  have  co-occurring  autoim-
mune  conditions  such  as  type  1  diabetes,  IBD,  Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis,
Graves’ disease, primary biliary cholangitis, scleroderma, SLE, and der-
matitis herpetiformis, an autoimmune blistering skin (Cohn et al., 2014;
Fröhlich-Reiterer et al., 2008; Kahaly et al., 2018; Kurien et al., 2016; Leb-
wohl et al., 2021; Márquez and Martin, 2021; Pascual et al., 2014; Regev
et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2005). When left untreated, celiac disease has sig-
nificant associated morbidity, including anemia, folate and B12 deficiency,
osteopenia and osteoporosis, gastrointestinal lymphoma, dental enamel
defects, neurologic complications such as such as peripheral neuropathy
and cerebellar ataxia, infertility, and growth retardation in children (Caio
et al., 2019; Catassi et al., 2005; Green et al., 2003; Jericho et al., 2017; Kup-
fer and Jabri, 2012; Lebwohl et al., 2018; Leonard et al., 2017; Lundin and
Wijmenga, 2015; Rubio-Tapia et al., 2013; Salem and Estephan, 2005; Ther-
rien et al., 2020). In addition, persons with the disease are at an increased
risk for pneumococcal infection, particularly if unvaccinated, as well as
sepsis (Simons et al., 2018).

Depression  and  related  mood  disorders  have  been  reported  to  be
more common in patients with celiac disease compared to those without
the  disease  (Jackson  et  al.,  2012;  Smith  and  Gerdes,  2012). Anxiety  dis-
orders  are  associated  with  gluten  intolerance,  and  there  are  conflicting
findings regarding whether a gluten-free diet decreases anxiety in patients
with celiac disease (Jackson et al., 2012; Rostami-Nejad et al., 2020).

An  uncommon  complication  is  refractory  celiac  disease  (Hujoel
and Murray, 2020; Penny et al., 2020). Symptoms mimic those of severe
untreated  celiac  disease;  however,  unlike  celiac  disease,  there  is  no  or,

138

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

at best, an incomplete response to dietary gluten withdrawal. The prog-
nosis  is  uncertain  for  patients  with  refractory  celiac  disease,  and  many
develop intractable nutritional deficiencies requiring long-term parenteral
alimentation that may lead to complicating infections. The importance of
diagnosing  celiac  disease-associated  with  these  concomitant  diseases  is
essential since a gluten-free diet is able to resolve symptoms and prevent
the potentially severe long-term complications (Caio et al., 2019).

Economic Impact

One   study  of   patients   with   celiac   disease   confirmed   by  endoscopic
biopsy estimated all-cause health costs associated with this disease over
the   course   of   2   years   (Cappell   et  al.,   2020).   Compared   with  health   care
costs  for  individuals  without celiac  disease,  the  average  all-cause  health
care  costs  for  individuals  with  celiac  disease  were  $15,687  versus  $12,220
at time zero, $19,181 versus $11,260 after 1 year, and $15,355 versus $11,579
in  year  two.  At the start of the study,  all-cause  inpatient admissions costs
and   outpatient  services   costs   were  higher  for  individuals   with  celiac
disease  than  for  controls,  but  outpatient  pharmacy  costs  were  similar
between  the  two  groups.  Patients  with  celiac  disease,  compared  with
control  subjects,  spent a  greater  percentage of  their  total  health care  costs
on   outpatient  services   (64.5   percent  versus   59.4   percent)   but  a   smaller
percentage   on   outpatient  pharmacy  expenses   (16.6   percent  versus   22.3
percent).

Risk Factors and Etiology

Celiac  disease  correlates  strongly  with  specific  variations  in  HLA
genes,  but  that  association  does  not  fully  account  for  the  risk  of  devel-
oping  the  disease  (Kuja-Halkola  et  al.,  2016;  Sciurti  et  al.,  2018).  Since
almost everyone consumes dietary gluten during his or her lifetime, other
environmental or other risk factors may trigger the body’s lost tolerance
to dietary gluten and increase the risk of developing celiac disease. Expo-
sures occurring in utero or very early in life may be important predispos-
ing factors, as suggested by the observation that children born during the
spring  and  summer  are  at  the  highest  risk  of  developing  celiac  disease
(Namatovu  et  al.,  2016).  Research  has  identified  several  promising  risk
factors,  including  gastrointestinal  infections  (Kemppainen  et  al.,  2017;
Lindfors  et  al.,  2019;  Stene  et  al.,  2006)  and  high  gluten  intake  in  early
childhood (Andrén Aronsson et al., 2019; Lindfors et al., 2019).

The development of celiac disease is complex, and multiple research
studies are in progress to better understand the pathogenic process. One
avenue of research is exploring the role that gliadins, key components of
gluten, play in disease development. Gliadins are complex proteins that

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

are  unusually  rich  in  the  amino  acids  proline  and  glutamine  and  that
intestinal  enzymes  cannot  break  down  completely.  The  final  product  of
this partial digestion is a mix of peptides that can trigger host responses
including  increased  gut  permeability  and  innate  and  adaptive  immune
responses that closely resemble those instigated by the exposure to poten-
tially harmful microorganisms (Caio et al., 2019).

Diagnostic Tools

Many cases of celiac disease occur with neither a family history nor
its classical symptoms such as chronic diarrhea and weight loss (Agardh
et al., 2015; Stahl et al., 2021). Noninvasive and more sensitive screening
tools have revealed celiac disease to be a heterogeneous disease (Lad and
Jacobson, 2001); in fact, nonspecific symptoms often go unrecognized by
clinicians  and  the  individuals  with  the  condition,  leading  to  diagnostic
delay (Paez et al., 2017). One study from the Netherlands, for example,
used antibody testing to screen a cohort of 6-year-old children for celiac
disease. This study found that screening-identified subclinical and asymp-
tomatic individuals had a lower body mass index and lower bone mineral
density than their healthy peers (Jansen et al., 2015, 2018), suggesting that
the disease process is occurring before symptoms are recognized and that
it  would  be  beneficial  to  screen  more  regularly  for  celiac  disease  using
both  the  Enzyme-linked  immunoassay  (ELISA)-based  anti-tissue  trans-
glutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin A (IgA) and the immunofluorescent
anti-endomysium (EmA) IgA tests (Baudon et al., 2004).

In the same way that the clinical manifestations of celiac disease can
vary  enormously,   so   too   can   laboratory  findings.   Patients   with   atypical
celiac disease often have no abnormalities in their complete blood count
and  comprehensive  panel  or merely show  evidence  of  iron or  folate  defi-
ciencies, while those with more classical presentations of the disease can
have   multiple   lab  test  abnormalities   such   as   abnormal   quantities   of   fat
in stool samples and abnormally low blood  levels of  albumin, the blood-
clotting protein  thrombin,  or  calcium  (Lebwohl  et al.,  2018;  Loginov  et al.,
1984;  Meena  et al.,  2020;  Rickels  and  Mandel,  2004).

Serologic tests are useful screening  tests for celiac disease. Both the
anti-tTG IgA and anti-EmA IgA tests have reported sensitivities of 94 to
98 percent and specificities of 91 to 100 percent (Caio et al., 2019; Leffler
and Schuppan, 2010), though the sensitivities of those assays are some-
what lower in infants, toddlers, and people with mild disease. Clinicians
use the anti-tTG IgA test as the initial screening test owing to its higher
sensitivity  (98  percent  versus  95  percent),  while  they  use  the  operator-
dependent and more costly anti-EmA IgA test when the anti-tTG IgA test
is unexpectedly negative or to confirm a positive anti-tTG IgA test (Leffler

140

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

and Schuppan, 2010; Medical Advisory, 2010; NIDDK, 2021a). Unexpected
false-negative results can occur among the 2 to 3 percent of people with
celiac  disease  who  also  have  an  IgA deficiency,  in  which  case  there  are
less sensitive IgG-based assays that clinicians can use (Caio et al., 2019;
Rubio-Tapia et al., 2013).

Recently,  both  anti-deamidated  gliadin  peptide  (DGP)  IgA and  IgG
antibody  tests  have  become  available,  though  there  is  no  evidence  that
anti-DGP IgA testing provides a significant advantage over anti-tTG IgA
testing. On the other hand, the anti-DGP IgG test has higher sensitivity
(80.0 percent) and specificity (98.0 percent) than the anti-tTG IgG test and
is  the  serological  test  of  choice  in  IgA-deficient  individuals  (Leffler  and
Schuppan, 2010; Zucchini et al., 2016).

The  gold  standard  for  celiac  diagnosis  remains  mucosal  intestinal
biopsy of the bulb, the distal duodenum, or proximal jejunum combined
with  a  clinical  response  to  eliminating  gluten  from  the  diet  of  an  indi-
vidual suspected to have celiac disease (Freeman, 2018). The one excep-
tion to this rule pertains to children and adolescents whose anti-tTG IgA
levels exceed 10 times the upper limit of normal, who are also anti-EmA
positive  using  a  separate  blood  sample,  and  who  test  positive  for  two
specific celiac-associated genes, HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 (Kelly et al.,
2015). If these criteria are met in the pediatric population, new guidelines
say that clinicians can skip the biopsy prior to starting the individual on
a gluten-free diet.

Treatment and Prospects for Cures

Adhering to a gluten-free diet is standard treatment for this disease.
Instead  of  eating  products  containing  wheat,  barley,  rye,  and  triticale,
individuals can turn to products made from rice, corn, potatoes, millet,
and soybeans. Individuals with celiac disease can tolerate moderate quan-
tities of oats, but only brands that are certified as not contaminated with
wheat and other cereal grains during processing and shipping (Green and
Cellier, 2007; Husby et al., 2019; Ludvigsson et al., 2014; Rubio-Tapia et
al., 2013). Individuals with celiac disease may also require iron and folate
supplements  if  laboratory  tests  show  deficiencies  in  these  micronutri-
ents, and they may require calcium and vitamin D supplements if bone
density  measurements  reveal  they  have  osteopenia  (NIH  Osteoporosis
and  Related  Bone  Diseases  National  Resource  Center,  2018;  Rondanelli
et  al.,  2019).  Other  aspects  of  care  for  individuals  with  celiac  disease
should include pneumococcal vaccination, especially if there is evidence
of decreased spleen function (Passanisi et al., 2020), and identification of
other food intolerances (Rubio-Tapia et al., 2013). Clinicians should refer

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

141

individuals with celiac disease to a dietician familiar with this disease and
to lay support groups to help them maintain gluten-free diets.

Clinicians should monitor dietary compliance every 6 to 12 months by
ordering a repeat anti-tTG IgA or anti-EmA IgA test; these antibodies dis-
appear when individuals comply fully with a gluten-free diet (Moreno et
al., 2017). If symptoms do not recur, specific follow-up medical care is not
necessary, aside perhaps from laboratory tests such as an annual hemoglo-
bin or hematocrit test and bone density monitoring (Beyond Celiac, n.d.).
Research on  preventing  celiac disease  has focused on manipulating
the infant diet, based on observational studies suggesting that the timing
of gluten introduction to the infant diet may affect the risk of developing
the disease (Pinto-Sánchez et al., 2016). While one randomized controlled
trial (RCT) in the general population found that infants who had gluten
added to their diets at 4 months of age had a reduced prevalence of celiac
disease  compared  with  infants  who  were  exclusively  breastfed  until  6
months of age (Logan et al., 2020), two larger RCTs in infants at risk for
celiac disease found no significant effect of the timing of gluten introduc-
tion on incidence of celiac disease (Lionetti et al., 2014; Vriezinga et al.,
2014).

Recently, investigators published the results of the first randomized
trial  of  a  transglutaminase  2  inhibitor  (Schuppan  et  al.,  2021).  In  this
preliminary  trial,  treatment  with  this  agent  attenuated  gluten-induced
duodenal mucosal damage in patients with celiac disease.

Animal Models

Researchers  have  developed  several  useful  animal  models  of  celiac
disease,  although  none  fully  captures  all  features  of  disease  pathology.
One group developed models of spontaneous gliadin-dependent intesti-
nal inflammation in rhesus macaques and Irish setters that produce some
of the hallmarks of celiac disease (Costes et al., 2015). Researchers have
also seen spontaneous inflammatory small bowel disease in horses that
resolves  after  6  months  of  a  gluten-free  diet  (van  der  Kolk  et  al.,  2012).
Investigators  have  used  gluten  sensitization  to  study  gluten-dependent
intestinal inflammation conditions in mice and rats. Some of the rodent
models  have  been  used  to  test  the  immunogenicity  of  detoxified  glu-
ten  products,  while  others  have  proven  valuable  for  studying  adaptive
immune  responses  to  gluten.  Recently,  researchers  have  developed  a
mouse model that overexpresses interleukin-15 (IL-15) in the gut epithe-
lium  and  thin  layer  of  connective  tissue  that  lies  beneath  the  epithelial
layer. This model mimics the immune system features and gluten-depen-
dent intestinal damage seen in celiac disease and suggests that location-
specific  expression  of  IL-15  plays  a  central  role  in  the  development  of

142

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

celiac  disease.  This  new  model  may  prove  useful  for  generating  new
knowledge about the development of celiac disease and for testing new
therapeutic strategies (Abadie et al., 2020).

Research Progress and Gaps

Celiac disease is unusual among autoimmune diseases in that research
has identified the external trigger—dietary gluten—and the genetic back-
ground  necessary  for  disease  development.  Even  with  this  knowledge,
though, there is currently no way to prevent the disease. Two prospective
cohort studies have leveraged NIH funding and studied the genetic and
environmental  determinants  of  both  type  1  diabetes  and  celiac  disease:
the  Colorado-based  Diabetes  Autoimmunity  Study  in  the  Young,  also
known as DAISY,5  and the multicenter international study The Environ-
mental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young, also known as TEDDY.6 In
these cohorts, the investigators are monitoring autoantibodies associated
with both type 1 diabetes and celiac disease frequently from birth, with
a prompt referral for further medical evaluation of those testing positive.
Follow-up of these cohorts is critical to understanding the life course of
celiac disease and to offer clues as to how to prevent these diseases.

An additional research gap is that celiac disease remains under-diag-
nosed  in  the  general  population  (Singh  et  al.,  2018).  Since  some  people
have minimal symptoms, those diagnosed with celiac disease may repre-
sent the tip of iceberg. Thus, more research is needed to estimate the true
incidence and prevalence in the population. Another major research gap
is that there is currently no treatment for the gastrointestinal symptoms
of  a  person  with  celiac  disease  who  has  inadvertently  ingested  gluten.
The gluten-free diet is very restrictive and not all “gluten-free” labels are
accurate. Inadvertent gluten ingestion can cause severe symptoms.

5 The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) is a prospective cohort study
that  enrolled  2,547  children  with  a  high-risk  HLA genotype  (enrolled  at  birth)  or  a  first-
degree relative with type 1 diabetes (enrolled between birth and age 7 years) (Frohnert et
al., 2017; NLM, 2021). The children have been monitored for over 20 years for development
of type 1 diabetes-related autoimmunity.

6 The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study is a prospec-
tive  observational  multicenter  cohort  study  to  identify  infectious  agents,  dietary  factors,
or other environmental exposures that are associated with increased risk of autoimmunity
and type 1 diabetes (NIDDK, 2021b). The study has enrolled 8,676 newborns who are less
than 4 months old with high-risk human leukocyte antigen alleles or who are first-degree
relatives of patients affected with type 1 diabetes. The children are followed up for 15 years.

PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS

PBC (previously called primary biliary cirrhosis) is an immune-medi-
ated chronic disease that slowly destroys the bile ducts in the liver. Per-
sons affected are commonly asymptomatic at presentation; however, they
may experience fatigue or symptoms of cholestasis such as itching skin
or fatty stool, or symptoms of cirrhosis such as hypertension of the portal
vein leading to the liver, or ascites, fluid collecting in the abdomen that
can be painful when severe (Civan, 2019; Mayo Clinic, 2021d). Individu-
als with PBC can develop cirrhosis and liver failure and may require liver
transplantation.

Epidemiology and Impact

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

Individuals  with  PBC  may  experience  severe,  long-term  conse-
quences resulting from complications related to chronic reduction in bile
flow, including osteoporosis, itchy skin, hyperlipidemia, fatigue, and sicca
syndrome,  one  form  of  which  is  Sjögren’s  disease.  A deficiency  of  fat-
soluble  vitamins  may  occur  in  persons  with  PBC,  particularly  in  those
with advanced-stage disease. Vitamin A deficiency can also occur in up to
one-third of those with the disease, and cases of night blindness have been
reported (Phillips et al., 2001; Waqar et al., 2010). Complications related
to cirrhosis include hepatocellular carcinoma and portal hypertension as
well  as  susceptibility  to  a  variety  of  infections  (Bajaj  et  al.,  2021).  Clini-
cians normally refer patients with end-stage PBC for liver transplantation
(Carey et al., 2015; Lindor et al., 2019).

Fatigue  is  a  major  complaint  in  individuals  with  PBC,  affecting
approximately  50  percent  of  those  with  the  disease,  and  20  percent  are
affected   in   significant  or   life-changing  ways   (Jopson  and   Jones,   2015).
Self-reported  anxiety  and  depression  or  depressive  symptoms  are  also
common (Sivakumar and Kowdley, 2021; Zenouzi et al., 2018), and a large
population  study  found   that  depression   and   fatigue   have   a   significant
effect on perceived quality of life in persons with PBC (Mells et al., 2013).

Economic Impact

One study estimated the average all-cause cost of inpatient medical
care for individuals with PBC to be $3,905 per patient per month (Primary
biliary  cholangitis:  Patient  characteristics  and  the  health  care  economic
burden in the United States, 2021), of which 66 percent, or an average of
$2,577 per patient per month, was attributed to PBC. This study also esti-
mated the average total cost for all health care for individuals with PBC
to be $6,568 per patient per month.

Researchers have also examined the cost effectiveness of obeticholic
acid (OCA) therapy (Samur et al., 2017) using a mathematical model to
simulate the lifetime course for patients with PBC treated with OCA plus
ursodeoxycholic  acid  (UDCA)  versus  UDCA  alone.  This  analysis  esti-
mated that OCA plus UDCA could reduce severe disease over the course
of  15  years.  Cumulative  incidence  of  decompensated  cirrhosis  would
decrease  from  12.2  percent  of  individuals  treated  with  UDCA  alone  to
4.5  percent,  hepatocellular  carcinoma  would  decrease  from  9.1  percent
to 4.0 percent, and liver-related deaths would decrease from 16.2 percent
to  5.7  percent.  The  need  for  liver  transplants  would  decrease  by  nearly
75 percent, from 4.5 percent of individuals with PBC to 1.2 percent, and
transplant-free survival would increase from 61.1 percent to 72.9 percent.
While the lifetime cost of adding OCA to the treatment regimen would

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

145

increase  from $63,000 to $902,000,  the  analysis estimated that  the  incre-
mental  cost-effectiveness  ratio  for  the  combination  therapy  would  be
$473,400 per quality-adjusted life year gained.

Risk Factors and Etiology

PBC develops through the combined effects of genetics, environment,
and autoimmunity.  A family history of PBC or of other autoimmune dis-
eases  and  a  history of  smoking are among the  risk factors  for PBC  (Smyk
et al.,  2012;  Tanaka  et al.,  2018).  The  first-degree  relatives  of  people  with
PBC  have  a  10-fold  higher  prevalence  of  disease than  the  general  popula-
tion,  and  PBC  has  the  highest reported  concordance  rate  (63  percent)  in
identical  twins  of  any autoimmune  disease  (Webb et al.,  2015).  The  preva-
lence of anti-mitochondrial autoantibodies, a biomarker for PBC, in the
first-degree  relatives  of  persons  with  PBC  is  13.1  percent compared  with
1  percent in controls  (Lindor  et al.,  2019).

Research  has  identified  several  possible  environmental  triggers  for
PBC, including infectious agents and industrial pollutants that have sig-
nificant homology with human mitochondrial proteins (Gershwin et al.,
2005; Juran and Lazaridis, 2014). Other potential triggers include cosmetic
products  such  as  nail  polish  and  lipsticks  (Tanaka  et  al.,  2018).  Several
studies have found an association between PBC and urinary tract infec-
tions  caused  by  Escherichia  coli  (Koutsoumpas  et  al.,  2014;  Wang  et  al.,
2014), while the evidence suggesting that environmental toxins may trig-
ger PBC comes from geographical clustering of PBC cases around areas of
toxic waste disposal and in low-income areas (Juran and Lazaridis, 2014).
Exposure  to  these  triggers  may  thus  lead  to  the  immune  system  losing
self-tolerance against the homologous human proteins, which results in
persistent T cell-mediated destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts and
injury from accumulating bile salts. Over time, this damage can lead to
biliary cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease (Figure 3-1).

Older  age  and  measures  of  poorer  liver  function  at  diagnosis  are
associated with a higher mortality risk from PBC (Lu et al., 2018), while
histologic stage of the disease predicts survival. One study measuring the
rate of histologic progression found that the average time for individuals
with PBC to develop extensive fibrosis was 2 years, with only a 29 percent
probability of stabilizing in early-stage PBC after 4 years. This study also
found that 50 percent of the individuals who only had what is known as
interface hepatitis without fibrosis developed cirrhosis within 4 years, and
only 20 percent of the pre-cirrhotic individuals were histologically stable.
The average rate of histologic stage progression was one stage every 1.5
years (Lindor et al., 2019).

Diagnostic Tools

PBC presents in a heterogeneous fashion; about 50 percent of people
are  asymptomatic  at  diagnosis  (Khanna  et  al.,  2018).  In  one  population
based  study,  approximately  half  of  patients  who  were  initially  asymp-
tomatic developed symptoms within 5 years of PBC diagnosis, and only
5 percent remained symptom free after 20 years (Prince et al., 2004). An
incidental  finding  of  elevated  alkaline  phosphate,  abnormally  low  bile
flow, or a positive test for anti-mitochondrial antibody after screening for
autoimmune extrahepatic disease are the common ways in which clini-
cians initially identify individuals with PBC (Hirschfield, 2017; Lindor et
al.,  2019).  Clinicians  will  confirm  a  PBC  diagnosis  when  two  of  the  fol-
lowing three criteria are met: assays suggesting that bile flow is reduced
or  absent,  the  presence  of  anti-mitochondrial  antibodies,  and  histology
results indicating inflammation of the interlobular bile ducts that does not
involve pus formation. Elevated bilirubin levels suggest more advanced
disease is present, and while aminotransferases can be elevated, the pat-
tern of liver injury is predominantly related to reduced or absent bile flow
(Hirschfield, 2017; Lindor et al., 2019).

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

147

Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are present in 90 to 95 percent of those
diagnosed with PBC (Colapietro et al., 2021). The presence of this autoan-
tibody, which is involved in T cell-mediated destruction of the bile ducts,
precedes biochemically apparent liver injury by several years. Individuals
with PBC may also test positive for antinuclear and other autoantibodies,
though their diagnostic utility is limited because of poor sensitivity (de
Liso et al., 2018).

Once there is biochemical evidence of reduced or absent bile flow—
via  an  elevated  level  of  alkaline  phosphatase  and  often  a  concurrently
elevated level of 5’-nucleotidase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase—
clinicians order noninvasive imaging of the liver and biliary tree to rule
out a biliary obstruction. Direct bilirubin is elevated in later stages of the
disease. In the event of an unclear diagnosis, clinicians may pursue X-ray
or MRI examination of the bile ducts; in some instances, it may be neces-
sary to conduct an endoscopic evaluation of the bile ducts.

Noninvasive  transient  elastography,  which  measures  liver  stiffness,
has proven to be highly accurate at diagnosing advanced fibrosis in indi-
viduals  with  PBC.  Progressive  liver  stiffness  in  PBC  is  predictive  of  a
poor  outcome  (Lindor  et  al.,  2019).  Liver  stiffness  increases  markedly
over  a  5-year  period  in  treated  individuals  with  cirrhosis  and  PBC;  in
treated individuals without cirrhosis, however, stiffness usually remains
stable (Lindor et al., 2019). One study found that individuals with a liver
stiffness of greater than 9.6 kilopascals—the normal range is 2 to 6 kilo-
pascals—were five times more likely to result in clinical decompensation,
death, or liver transplantation (Corpechot et al., 2012).

Treatments and Prospects for Cures

UDCA  is  the  first-line  therapy  for  PBC  (Poupon  et al.,  1997),  and  clini-
cal trials have shown that UDCA therapy improves liver biochemistries,
improves survival, and reduces the need for liver transplantation (Figure
3-2)  (Carey et al.,  2015;  Lindor  et al.,  2019).  Individuals  with  early-stage
PBC  typically respond  better  to  UDCA  than  those  with  advanced  disease;
however,  even  in  individuals  with  advanced  disease,  treatment  with  a
UDCA  dosage of 13–15  milligrams  per  kilogram  of  body weight per  day
may  improve  survival  and  eliminate  the  need  for  liver  transplantation
(Corpechot  et  al.,   2000;   Lindor   et  al.,   1994;   Poupon  et  al.,   1994).   UDCA
therapy may also reduce serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
and   slow   histologic   progression   (Corpechot  et  al.,   2000;  Poupon   et  al.,
1993), but  it  does not  improve fatigue, itchy  skin, associated bone disease,
or  autoimmune  features  that can  accompany PBC  (Lindor  et al.,  2019).

Clinical  guidelines  state  that  clinicians  should  assess  the  biochemi-
cal  response  after  1  year  of  UDCA  therapy,  with  liver  biopsy  being

148










OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

149

uninformative (Lindor et al., 2019). Bilirubin level is strongest indicator
of survival after treatment with UDCA, with alkaline phosphatase levels
also   being  a   predictor  of   survival   (Hirschfield,   2017).   Positive   response
to  UDCA  therapy is typically evident with a  few weeks, with 90 percent
of  the  improvement occurring in  6  to  9  months  and  20  percent of  those
treated  with  UDCA  having normalized  liver  biochemistries  after  2  years
of  treatment (Lindor et al.,  2019).  Life  expectancy for  individuals  whose
bilirubin and  alkaline  phosphatase  levels return to normal after treatment
(Hirschfield, 2017;  Hohenester  et al.,  2009).

In  2016,  FDA  approved  OCA  for  individuals  who  cannot  tolerate
UDCA, and in combination with UDCA for the treatment of individuals
who  do  not  have  an  adequate  response  to  UDCA alone  after  1  year  of
treatment  (Krupa  et  al.,  2022).  In  September  2017,  FDA issued  a  warn-
ing regarding the use of OCA in patients with moderate to severe liver
impairment following reports that OCA was associated with worsening
PBC and death (FDA, 2017b). In May 2021, FDA restricted the use of OCA
in patients that have PBC with advanced cirrhosis of the liver due to the
potential  for  serious  harm,  such  as  advanced  liver  decompensation  or
liver failure, that can be attributed to starting OCA (FDA, 2021b).

OCA modulates bile acid synthesis, absorption, transport, secretion,
and metabolism with the net effect of increasing the flow of bile from the
liver (FDA, 2018b; Hirschfield et al., 2015). There is some evidence from
animal models that OCA might have antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory
activity.  While  clinical  trials  assessing  whether  OCA  has  an  effect  on
survival of individuals with PBC are in progress, simulation models sug-
gest that combined UDCA and OCA therapy could decreases the 15-year
cumulative incidences of decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carci-
noma, liver transplants, and liver-associated mortality (Samur et al., 2017).
Studies have shown that fibrates, medication prescribed to lower high
triglyceride levels, can reduce bile acid synthesis and increase production
of  bile  acid  transporter  molecules.  As  a  result,  studies  have  evaluated
fibrates  for  treating  PBC  and  found  them  to  be  effective  for  individu-
als who do not respond to UDCA (Corpechot et al., 2018; Honda et al.,
2019; Iwasaki et al., 1999). Recent studies have shown fibrates to improve
liver biochemistries and liver stiffness, in addition to increasing survival
without liver transplantation (Corpechot et al., 2018; Honda et al., 2019).
Investigators have evaluated a number of other drugs, but none were
effective  as  single  agents,  and  those  investigated  in  combination  with
UDCA did not yield greater benefit than UDCA alone (Lindor et al., 2019).
More  recently,  researchers  have  been  studying  peroxisome  proliferator
activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) agonists and various antifibrotic agents
as potential PBC therapies (Gerussi et al., 2020).

Animal Models

Investigators  have  developed  a  variety  of  animal  models  that  reca-
pitulate  at  least  some  of  the  clinical,  histological,  and  immunological
features of PBC These models include genetically modified spontaneous
models,  xenobiotic  immunized  models,  and  infection-triggered  models.
No single animal model, however, reflects the varied clinical course and
complex immunology of PBC (Katsumi et al., 2015).

Research Progress and Gaps

The lack of effective medical therapies for treating PBC, and particu-
larly  for  treating  severe  cases  of  itching  skin  in  some  individuals  with
PBC, represents a critical gap. Novel therapies continue to be investigated.
Better genetic and immunology screening tests are needed to determine
who  is  at  elevated  risk  for  developing  PBC.  Research  on  approaches  to
preventing histopathologic disease in those with positive serology is also
required. New animal models that reflect the varied clinical course and
complex immunology of PBC would be helpful. In addition, life-course
studies that follow the patient through diagnosis, treatment, and disease
sequelae, as well as incidence and prevalence studies that reflect the entire
U.S. population, are needed.

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disorder of the CNS that causes
inflammation  that  damages  the  myelin  sheath  enveloping  the  axons  of
neurons.  This  inflammation  can  also  eventually  affect  the  nerve  fibers
themselves, causing them to degenerate. Demyelination, with or without
nerve fiber degeneration, interrupts transmission of signals that control
muscle function and bring sensation from organs and limbs in the body
(Mayo Clinic, 2020a; Podbielska et al., 2013). Depending on the location
of the damage in the brain and spinal cord, a wide range of neurologic
symptoms and impairment can occur, including vision problems, numb-
ness, tremor, lack of coordination, impaired balance, weakness, bowel and
bladder problems, and inability to walk (Mayo Clinic, 2021c). In addition,
fatigue  is  a  common  manifestation  of  multiple  sclerosis  and  has  been
found to have a significant negative impact on patient-reported quality
of life (Young et al., 2021).

Relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis  is  the  type  of  multiple  scle-
rosis  initially  diagnosed  among  85  percent  of  individuals  with  a  new
diagnosis  of  multiple  sclerosis;  it  is  characterized  by  episodes  of  neu-
rological  relapses  followed  by  partial  or  complete  neurologic  recovery

(Goldenberg,  2012).  In  a  majority of  individuals,  symptoms  remit over  a
period of weeks to months. Prior to the development of disease-modify-
ing therapies,  about half  of  individuals  with  relapsing-remitting multiple
sclerosis  would  transition  to  a  second  phase,  called  secondary progressive
multiple   sclerosis,   within   10   years   (National   Multiple   Sclerosis   Society,
n.d.-a).   The   course   of  secondary  progressive   multiple   sclerosis   is   char-
acterized  by neurologic  progression,  with  few  or  no  episodes  of  relapse.
Primary progressive multiple sclerosis is a different type of multiple
sclerosis, and it is initially diagnosed in 15 percent of individuals with a
new  diagnosis.  It  is  characterized  by  neurological  progression  from  the
onset of presentation, without relapses and remissions early in the course
of disease (National Multiple Sclerosis Society, n.d.-b, 2020; Thompson et
al., 2018).

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

There is significant clinical heterogeneity in multiple sclerosis, with
a varied accumulation of disability. The disease is a major cause of dis-
ability in young adults, particularly if it enters a progressive phase with
persistent, non-remitting neurologic manifestations (Dimitrov and Turner,
2014).  There  are  also  substantial  financial  and  psychosocial  costs  to  the
individual  and  society  (Rodriguez-Rincon  et  al.,  2019;  Schriefer  et  al.,
2021).

Complications that commonly accompany multiple sclerosis include
urinary  tract  infections  from  bladder  dysfunction  and  pressure  ulcers
resulting from immobility. Research has yet to determine whether depres-
sion is a primary manifestation, a complication of multiple sclerosis, or
both. The lifetime risk of depression among those with multiple sclerosis
is estimated to reach as high as 50 percent (Sadovnick et al., 1996), and
the  prevalence  of  depression  is  estimated  to  be  26  percent  in  the  18- to
45-year-old subgroup of those with multiple sclerosis (Patten et al., 2003).
The occurrence of moderate to severe depressive symptoms in individu-
als with multiple sclerosis is approximately double that of age-matched
individuals  in  the  general  population  (Chan  et  al.,  2021).  Anxiety  and
sleep disorders—with or without memory problems—also appear to be
more common in individuals with multiple sclerosis than in the general
population (Bamer et al., 2008; Boeschoten et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018;
Sumowski et al., 2021).

Other disorders that studies have found to have a higher prevalence
in individuals with multiple sclerosis relative to populations without mul-
tiple  sclerosis  include  hypertension,  hypercholesterolemia,  and  chronic
lung disease, though research has not identified the mechanisms for these
associations  (Magyari  and  Sorensen,  2020;  Narula,  2016).  Research  has
also shown that autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes, psoria-
sis, and IBD have a higher prevalence in persons with multiple sclerosis
than in persons without the disease (Magyari and Sorensen, 2020).

Economic Impact

A  2013  review  of  studies  examining  the  health  care  costs  of  mul-
tiple  sclerosis  noted  that  the  estimated  annual  direct  costs  per  patient
of  $21,238  in  2011  dollars  were  second  only  to  congestive  heart  failure
(Adelman  et  al.,  2013).  The  studies  cited  in  the  review  were  conducted
between 1999 and 2008 and so would not have included costs of newer,
more expensive drug therapies.

Risk Factors and Etiology

The  cause  of  multiple  sclerosis  is  not  known,  though  research  has
identified a number of genetic and environmental factors that increase the
risk of developing multiple sclerosis. Much of the evidence suggests that
multiple sclerosis results when one or more environmental factors inter-
act  with  a  genetic  predisposition  to  the  disease.  The  risk  of  developing
multiple sclerosis is up to 20 percent higher for individuals with a parent
or sibling with multiple sclerosis compared with those with no family his-
tory of the disease (Compston and Coles, 2002, 2008), which suggests the
influence of both genetic and environmental factors. The main marker of
genetic susceptibility to the disease is located in the HLA coding region
of  the  human  genome,  although  research  has  identified  more  than  200
other loci affecting risk (Canto and Oksenberg, 2018). In addition to the
genetic risk, epidemiological studies have identified numerous environ-
mental risk factors for the development and/or progression of multiple
sclerosis, including exposure to EBV (Biström et al., 2021; Langer-Gould et
al., 2017), early-life obesity, vitamin D deficiency, cigarette smoking, and
exposure to air pollution (Aa Høglund et al., 2021; Ascherio and Munger,
2016; Huppke et al., 2019; Munger et al., 2016; Noorimotlagh et al., 2021).
A recent study of more than 10 million active-duty U.S. personnel between
1993 and 2003 found that risk of developing multiple sclerosis increased
32-fold after infection with EBV (Bjornevik et al., 2022). Exposure to early-
life obesity, smoking, or EBV appear to interact with an HLA risk allele to
result in an even higher risk of multiple sclerosis, although the biological
explanations  for  these  gene-environment  interactions  are  far  from  clear
(Hedström et al., 2021; Olsson et al., 2017). Increasingly, research is show-
ing  that  the  gut  microbiome  is  a  potential  factor  in  the  development  of
multiple sclerosis (Burton, 2018).

Diagnostic Tools

There  is  no  single  feature  or  diagnostic  test  for  multiple  sclerosis.
Rather, clinicians make a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis based on a com-
bination  of  historical  and  physical  examination,  and  imaging  findings.
Diagnostic criteria proposed in 1965 and 1983 called for a multiple scle-
rosis  diagnosis  based  on  two  separate  attacks  of  neurologic  symptoms,
including  motor,  sensory,  or  visual  disturbances,  that  are  disseminated
in terms of the location of CNS lesions and occur at least 1 month apart,
excluding other diseases with similar features (Poser et al., 1983; Schum-
acher et al., 1965). The 1983 guidelines aimed to establish more objective
and  standardized  diagnostic  criteria,  as  well  as  supporting  laboratory
features including  presence of increased IgG  levels in  the cerebrospinal
fluid but normal levels in serum (Poser et al., 1983).

154

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Newer diagnostic criteria proposed in 2001, 2005, and 2010 incorpo-
rate brain MRI criteria for establishing dissemination of CNS lesions in
space and time (Polman et al., 2011). Brain MRI is the most sensitive test to
estimate CNS lesion load and disease activity, progression, and prognosis.
More recent criteria proposed in 2010 and 2017 enable a diagnosis from a
single baseline MRI, which has the potential to result in earlier and more
accurate diagnosis and lead to prompt treatment (Milo and Miller, 2014;
van der Vuurst de Vries et al., 2018). Despite these advances, it remains
challenging to diagnose multiple sclerosis because early symptoms can be
vague and transient. In addition, there is no specific biomarker or labora-
tory  test  for  multiple  sclerosis  (Solomon  et  al.,  2019),  and  misdiagnosis
can occur when the symptoms mimic those of other disease and healthy
states (Calabrese et al., 2021).

There is increasing evidence that there are early signs of symptoms
of multiple sclerosis that appear before the first overt symptoms appear
(Giovannoni,  2017).  MRI  studies  have  detected  asymptomatic  lesions,
especially during the early course of disease. In fact, MRI scans of asymp-
tomatic first-degree relatives of people with multiple sclerosis find brain
lesions  in  approximately  10  percent  of  those  individuals.  These  lesions
could  indicate  demyelination  is  occurring.  Because  these  lesions  fulfill
the  requirement  to  be  disseminated  in  the  CNS,  this  finding  suggests
there may be an asymptomatic preclinical state (De Stefano et al., 2006;
Xia et al., 2017). In addition, clinically isolated syndrome refers to a single
episode  of  neurologic  symptoms  lasting  at  least  24  hours  and  meeting
other  criteria  that  rules  out  other  causes  of  the  symptoms.  If  neuroim-
aging  studies  show  abnormalities  consistent  with  demyelination  in  the
region  that  correlates  with  the  neurologic  symptoms,  there  is  a  60–80
percent  risk  of developing  multiple sclerosis within the next  few years;
when neuroimaging abnormalities are not present, there is a much lower
(~20 percent) chance of developing multiple sclerosis over a similar time
frame  (National  Multiple  Sclerosis  Society,  n.d.-a).  Initiation  of  disease-
modifying therapy is often recommended, particularly for the high-risk
category of clinically isolated syndrome (Jokubaitis et al., 2015a; National
Multiple Sclerosis Society, n.d.-d; Tsivgoulis et al., 2015).

Treatment and Prospects for Cures

FDA approved the first disease-modifying therapy for multiple scle-
rosis in the United States in 1993 (Loma and Heyman, 2011). Since then,
FDA has  approved  a  host  of  other  agents  that  can  be  administered  by
pill,  injection,  or  infusion  (National  Multiple  Sclerosis  Society,  n.d.-c).
These disease-modifying therapies target various aspects of the immune
system to reduce the CNS inflammation that occurs in multiple sclerosis.

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

155

Disease-modifying  therapies  are  generally  most  effective  in  those  who
have  relapsing-remitting  disease,  have  more  active  disease  (as  detected
by MRI), who are younger, and who are less disabled (National Multiple
Sclerosis Society, n.d.-b, 2020; Signori et al., 2015), with treatment delays
associated with more clinical symptoms and more abnormalities in MRI
scans  (Comi,  2013;  Deangelis  and  Miller,  2014;  Jokubaitis  et  al.,  2015b;
Kavaliunas  et  al.,  2017;  Kinkel  et  al.,  2006).  To  date,  FDA has  approved
only one medication, ocrelizumab, for primary progressive multiple scle-
rosis (FDA, 2017a).

The  National  Multiple  Sclerosis  Society7  website  provides  an  over-
view of disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis. A subgroup of
disease-modifying therapies is characterized as “high-efficacy” or “highly
effective”  as  they  are  more  potent,  but  they  usually  also  have  a  higher
risk of serious side effects (Merkel et al., 2017). A thorough discussion of
pros and cons is recommended for shared decision-making with patients
(Col et al., 2019). Several international studies suggest that the advent of
disease-modifying therapies has altered the natural history of relapsing-
remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (Beiki  et  al.,  2019;  Simonsen  et  al.,  2021).
Autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (also known as bone mar-
row transplant) has been recommended as having sufficient evidence to
be carefully considered for the minority of patients with multiple sclerosis
whose  disease  activity  is  substantial  and  continues  despite  treatment
with even a high-efficacy disease-modifying therapy, or for patients for
whom there is a contraindication to a disease-modifying therapy. Owing
to the serious risks that accompany this treatment, the National Multiple
Sclerosis  Society’s  National  Medical  Advisory  Committee  recommends
that  candidates  under  the  age  of  50  and  with  disease  of  less  than  10
years’  duration  may  have  a  better  risk/benefit  ratio  for  this  aggressive
treatment (Miller et al., 2021).As noted previously, fatigue is a symptom
that  significantly  adversely  affects  many  with  multiple  sclerosis.  There
is  evidence  that  some  behavioral  and  exercise  interventions  directed  at
reducing  fatigue  and  its  impact  can  be  beneficial  (Moss-Morris  et  al.,
2021). With an estimated lifetime risk of depression in multiple sclerosis
reaching  as  high  as  50  percent,  periodic  screening  and  assessment,  and
implementation  of  treatment,  is  recommended  (Patten,  2020;  Skokou  et
al., 2012). Spasticity, balance and gait, and impairment in functional status
are ideally addressed with rehabilitation and other modalities (Donzé and
Massot, 2021).

Animal Models

Investigators have developed several animal models to study aspects
of the pathogenic mechanisms driving autoimmunity directed against the
CNS (Procaccini et al., 2015). The most commonly studied is the experi-
mental  autoimmune  encephalomyelitis  (EAE)  mouse  model,  in  which
immunizing the mice with specific proteins or peptides targeted by the
immune system in multiple sclerosis induces an autoimmune demyelinat-
ing disease (Constantinescu et al., 2011). The specific features of disease
that develop depend on the antigen used and the genetic strain of mouse,
with  some  developing  chronic  CNS  inflammation  and  others  develop-
ing  a  relapsing-remitting  course.  This  variability  enables  researchers  to
study  the  different  disease  courses  seen  in  humans  and  has  provided
information regarding the autoimmune response, but the need to induce
disease with immunization yields a more artificial model than in sponta-
neous models of the disease. Identification of specific peptides targeted
by autoreactive T cells in EAE mouse model studies has led researchers
to develop mice that they genetically engineer to express the pathogenic
T-cell receptors, which results in an overabundance of pathogenic T cells
that  target  the  self-antigen  and  the  spontaneous  development  of  EAE
(Frausto et al., 2007; Goverman, 2009).

In addition to EAE, researchers have developed procedures for induc-
ing rodents to develop a demyelinating disease following infection with
certain viruses, such as Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus or treat-
ment with certain toxins (Gerhauser et al., 2019). Together, these models
have  enabled  detailed  studies  of  immune  and  non-immune  features  of
demyelinating  disease,  including  visualizing  the  interactions  between
cells within the brain and spinal cord, which is not as easily performed
or studied in humans.

Research Progress and Gaps

Regarding pathophysiology and identifying targets for treatment of
multiple  sclerosis,  ongoing  research  includes  investigating  the  role  of
the  gut  microbiome  as  well  as  the  pathways  by  which  inflammatory
cells breach the barriers into the CNS. Genetic studies are investigating
complex  gene–environment  interactions  (Horng  et  al.,  2017;  Takewaki
and Yamamura, 2021). While there has been substantial progress in using
disease-modifying therapies to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclero-
sis, there is currently limited evidence for therapies that slow progression
in  the  progressive  type  of  the  disease.  Given  the  greater  prevalence  of
multiple sclerosis among women of child-bearing years, and the welcome
advent of disease-modifying therapies, research to generate evidence on

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

157

the  optimal  management  of  multiple  sclerosis  before,  during,  and  after
pregnancy  is  needed.  While  there  have  been  animal  studies  that  have
yielded  targets  for  CNS  remyelination,  there  are  barriers  to  translating
this knowledge to develop remyelination therapies, such as how to best
design and best evaluate clinical trials (Lubetzki et al., 2020). The associa-
tion of low vitamin D with disease onset and relapse frequency warrants
further investigation of whether intervention to raise vitamin D levels can
affect disease course (Mansoor et al., 2021). The roles of stem-cell trans-
plantation and other cell therapies are not fully developed.

There is a substantial need to develop early-detection techniques to
enable  treatment  to  begin  as  early  as  possible.  Early  biomarkers,  such
as  autoantibody  screens  and  additional  MRI  indicators,  are  needed  to
detect disease sooner, before irreversible damage occurs. Early biomark-
ers would be particularly valuable for screening higher-risk, asymptom-
atic family members of people with multiple sclerosis who are more likely
to have early subclinical manifestations of the disease. Developing early
markers would benefit from cohort studies that follow high-risk individu-
als longitudinally. Prospective, longitudinal studies would also enable the
study of multiple sclerosis from a life-course perspective. While several
registries have been developed around the world in recent decades, one
review  found  “a  significant  number  of  largely  uncoordinated  parallel
studies,” and many of them use convenience samples (Bebo et al., 2018).
From a public health perspective, there is a need to develop systems by
which researchers can obtain reliable epidemiological data regarding the
prevalence, incidence, and time trends of multiple sclerosis.

In addition, there is a need for health-services research to investigate
and design interventions to overcome delays in the diagnosis of multiple
sclerosis,  including  delays  that  differentially  affect  non-White  persons
and women, as well as those with decreased access to health care. Risk-
stratification and prediction algorithms are needed to predict who is likely
to have a more aggressive disease course as a means of guiding decision-
making  around  the  selection  and  sequence  of  use  of  disease-modifying
therapies and other emerging therapies.

Treatments to manage the “invisible” symptoms of multiple sclerosis
that  have  profound  impacts  on  health-related  quality  of  life,  including
fatigue, depression, and anxiety, lack a body of evidence, despite many
promising leads (Lakin et al., 2021). The potential value of Chronic Care
Model-based approaches in providing comprehensive multiple sclerosis
care and implementing strategies to optimize care and patient outcomes
is understudied, yet as the United States moves toward value-based pay-
ment models, such research evidence is needed to guide implementation
of coordinated chronic care that will maximize patient outcomes (Cotton
et al., 2016).

TYPE 1 DIABETES

Type  1  diabetes  is  characterized  by  autoimmune  damage,  impair-
ment, and eventual destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta
cells, which leads to a dependence on administered insulin. If not treated
with insulin, type 1 diabetes leads to hyperglycemia, which, if unchecked,
results  in  deadly  diabetic  ketoacidosis  and  coma  in  an  acute  state,  and
microvascular and macrovascular end-organ complications in a chronic
state.  Type  1  diabetes  is  generally  preceded  by  the  appearance  of  islet
autoantibodies in the blood, defined as islet autoimmunity; however, not
all  those  who  develop  islet  autoimmunity  progress  to  type  1  diabetes
(Kwon et al., 2022; Regnell and Lernmark, 2017).

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

Diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia are acute and poten-
tially life-threatening complications of type 1 diabetes. While type 1 dia-
betes  is  more  common  in  non-Hispanic  White  people,  the  frequency  of
diabetic  ketoacidosis  is  higher  among  ethnic  minority,  individuals  with
lower socioeconomic status, and those who lack private health insurance
(Rewers, 2018). The percentage of hospitalizations for severe hypoglyce-
mia is higher in males compared with females and lower in White per-
sons than in any other racial or ethnic group (Rewers, 2018). The chronic
complications  of  type  1  diabetes  include  microvascular  and  macrovas-
cular  conditions.  Individuals  with  type  1  diabetes  are  at  increased  risk
for  retinopathy  leading  to  sight-loss/blindness  (Klein  and  Klein,  2018),
nephropathy leading to ESRD (Pavkov et al., 2018), and neuropathy and
peripheral vascular disease leading to amputation (Boyko et al., 2018).

Individuals  with  type  1  diabetes  are  at  increased  risk  of  conditions
such as heart disease and stroke (Barrett-Connor et al., 2018; Mayo Clinic,
2020b), as well as co-occurring autoimmune illnesses, particularly celiac
disease (Cohn et al., 2014). A recent large study in Finland found that one
out of five persons with type 1 diabetes develops one or more additional
autoimmune diseases, with Graves’ disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and
celiac  disease  being  among  the  most  common  (Barker,  2006;  Makimat-
tila  et  al.,  2020).  The  prevalence  of  depression  is  significantly  higher  in
individuals with type 1 diabetes compared with those without diabetes
(Farooqi  et  al.,  2021).  Eating  disorders  are  twice  as  common  in  adoles-
cent females with type 1 diabetes compared with those without diabetes,
though few studies on this topic are available (Jones et al., 2000).

Individuals with type 1 diabetes are more likely to develop infections,
such as bone and joint infections (Schwartz, 2018), acute cholecystitis, gas-
trointestinal   infections,   mycoses,   pneumonia,   sepsis,   surgical   site   infec-
tions,   endocarditis,   meningitis,   urinary  tract  infections,   cellulitis,   lower
extremity  infections  and  foot  ulcers,  and  tuberculosis  compared  with
individuals  without type  1  diabetes  (Carey et al.,  2018;  NIDDK,  2018a).
Data consistently show that diabetes increases risk of severe COVID-19
(Hartmann-Boyce  et al.,  2021),  although  most studies  did  not distinguish
between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. One population study in the United
Kingdom  found  that the  risk of  in-hospital  COVID-19-related  death  was
markedly higher in people with type 1 diabetes compared with those with
type  2  diabetes  (Barron  et al.,  2020;  Holman  et al.,  2020).

Type 1 diabetes increases the risk of mortality, stroke and cerebrovas-
cular  complications,  myocardial  infarction,  and  pre-eclampsia  in  preg-
nant  individuals  (NIDDK,  2018a).  Women  with  type  1  diabetes  have
a  higher  risk  of  having  infants  with  macrosomia  and  associated  birth
trauma,  respiratory  distress,  and  congenital  malformations  compared

160

with women without type 1 diabetes. The risks of poor outcomes in the
mother and newborn are mitigated with better glycemic control during
pregnancy although this requires intensive care and monitoring (Alexo-
poulos et al., 2019; Lemaitre et al., 2021; NIDDK, 2018a).

Individuals with type 1 diabetes incur, on average, $1,981 more per
year  in  medical  costs  than  those  without  type  1  diabetes.  The  expected
lifetime  medical  costs  for  all  people  with  type  1  diabetes  exceeds  $130
billion (Tao et al., 2010).

Risk Factors and Etiology

In  type  1  diabetes,  the  body’s  immune  system  mistakenly  destroys
the insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas, leading to hypoglycemia
and clinical diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the presence of
autoantibodies years prior to the diagnosis of the disease, making them
strong  serologic  markers  of  preclinical  disease.  The  autoantibodies  that
precede type 1 diabetes include antibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decar-
boxylase, islet antigen 2, and zinc transporter family member 8 antigens
(Pietropaolo  et  al.,  2012).  While  development  of  islet  autoimmunity  is
highly  predictive  of  future  type  1  diabetes,  not  all  those  who  develop
islet autoimmunity progress to disease (Regnell and Lernmark, 2017). It
is  unknown  what  factors  trigger  this  autoimmune  attack  and  whether
similar or different factors perpetuate the autoimmunity that eventually
results in disease.

Genetics play a key role in type 1 diabetes etiology, with the strongest
risk alleles mapped to the HLA region of the genome. Large-scale studies
show that type 1 diabetes is a polygenic disease with more than 40 risk
loci  (Barrett  et  al.,  2009).  However,  the  incidence  of  type  1  diabetes  has
been increasing at an exponential rate (Onkamo et al., 1999), a change that
is too rapid to be explained by genetic factors alone, which suggests a role
for non-genetic factors in disease etiology (Norris et al., 2020).

While researchers have investigated several candidate environmental
factors, they have yet to fully elucidate what role they play in the develop-
ment of type 1 diabetes. Of these candidate environmental factors, a large
number  are  related  to  in  utero  or  neonatal  exposures,  including  higher
maternal age at delivery, higher maternal pre- or early-gestational obesity,
maternal virus infections, and Cesarean section (Norris et al., 2020; Yue et
al., 2018). However, given the relatively low incidence of the disease, it is
difficult and costly to obtain data to investigate these factors. Researchers
are also examining exposures during infancy, including increased infant

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

growth, shorter duration of breastfeeding, and timing of the introduction
of  solid  foods,  and  omega-3  fatty  acid  intake  and  status  (Norris  et  al.,
2020).  Research  has  provided  some  evidence  that  childhood  exposures,
such  as  higher  cow’s  milk  intake,  higher  gluten  intake,  higher  sugar
intake, lower vitamin D status, and enterovirus infection, are candidate
risk factors for type 1 diabetes (Norris et al., 2020).

Diagnostic Tools

It is possible to diagnose a clinical state of type 1 diabetes using an
elevated  2-hour  glucose  measure  during  an  oral  glucose  tolerance  test,
a  high  hemoglobin A1C  blood  test,  two  high  random  blood-sugar  tests
coupled  with  any  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  diabetes,  or  two  high
fasting blood-sugar tests.

There are three distinct stages of type 1 diabetes (Insel et al., 2015).
Stage 1 is defined by the presence of two or more diabetes-related autoan-
tibodies in the blood with normal blood glucose levels (Insel et al., 2015).
Stage  2  commences  when  blood  glucose  levels  begin  to  rise,  signaling
functional impairment of the islet cells. Stage 3 occurs when symptoms
of  glucose  dysregulation,  such  as  the  production  of  abnormally  large
volumes  of  dilute  urine  or  diabetic  ketoacidosis,  appear.  While  a  clini-
cal diagnosis is made only at Stage 3, the likelihood of progressing from
Stage 1 to Stage 3 is very high, with a 5- and 10-year risk of 44 percent
and 70 percent, respectively (Insel et al., 2015; Ziegler et al., 2013; Zuily
et al., 2015).

Treatment and Prospects for Cures

Treatment for type 1 diabetes includes insulin therapy; dietary carbo-
hydrate,  fat,  and  protein  counting;  and  frequent blood-sugar  monitoring.
The  goal  of  treatment is  to  keep blood-sugar  level  as  close  to  normal  as
possible  and  delay  or  prevent  complications.  Insulin  therapy  involves
either multiple daily insulin injections or use of an insulin pump, a device
worn outside of the body that dispenses insulin as needed. In 2019, FDA
approved  the  “artificial  pancreas,”  an  implanted  closed-loop  insulin
delivery device,  for  individuals  with  type  1  diabetes  (FDA,  2018a,  2019).
A Phase III clinical trial of pancreatic islet transplantation in persons with
type  1  diabetes  who  have  impaired  awareness  of  hypoglycemia  and  are
at elevated  risk of  severe  hypoglycemic  events  showed  improvement in
blood  glucose  awareness  and  control  (Hering et al.,  2016)  as  well  as  qual-
ity of  life  (Foster  et al.,  2018).  Studies  have  demonstrated  that people  who
maintain  tight blood  glucose  control  in  the  early stages  of  disease  are  less
likely to undergo retinopathy eye surgeries (DCCT/EDIC Research Group

162

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

et al., 2015) and are likely to live longer compared with those who do not
(Writing Group for the DCCT/EDIC Research Group et al., 2015).

 In studies of infants at risk for type 1 diabetes, one diet-manipulation
study  that  replaced  cow’s  milk-based  infant  formula  with  hydrolyzed
infant formula had no effect on the incidence of islet autoantibodies (Knip
et  al.,  2014)  or  diabetes  (Writing  Group  for  the  TRIGR  Study  Group  et
al., 2018), while another study that removed bovine insulin from infant
formula showed a decrease in incidence of islet autoimmunity at 3 years
of  age  (Vaarala  et  al.,  2012).  A  third  study  found  that  delaying  gluten
exposure until age 12 months did not substantially reduce the risk of islet
autoimmunity (Hummel et al., 2011). Interventions targeting the immune
system  have  not  slowed,  halted,  or  reversed  the  destruction  of  insulin-
producing  beta  cells  (Skyler  et  al.,  2018).  Only  one  of  nine  secondary
prevention trials—a trial of the anti-CD3 antibody teplizumab (Herold et
al., 2019)—showed any delay in progression of individuals with Stage 1 or
Stage 2 disease to full-blown type 1 diabetes (Diabetes Prevention Trial—
Type 1 Diabetes Study Group, 2002; Elding Larsson et al., 2018; Gale et
al., 2004; Krischer et al., 2017; Lampeter et al., 1998; Näntö-Salonen et al.,
2008; Vandemeulebroucke et al., 2009; Vehik et al., 2011).

Animal Models

Three spontaneous autoimmune animal models, including the non-
obese diabetic mouse, the biobreeding Komeda rat, and the LEW.1AR1-
iddm rat, are the primary animal models for studying type 1 diabetes (Al-
Awar et al., 2016; King, 2012; Kottaisamy et al., 2021). These models allow
the  researcher  to  examine  beta  cell  destruction  during  an  autoimmune
process, probe the genetics and mechanisms underlying type 1 diabetes,
manipulate the autoimmune process, and study treatments that prevent
beta  cell  death.  Genetically  induced  models  include  the  AKITA mouse
and  the  KINGS  Ins2+/G32S  mouse,  which  demonstrate  beta  cell  destruc-
tion resulting from endoplasmic reticulum stress (King, 2012). Research-
ers can use them as transplantation models and to develop new insulin
formulations  and  treatments  to  prevent  endoplasmic  reticulum  stress.
Virally induced animal models enable researchers to investigate beta cell
destruction induced by viral infection of the beta cells, while chemically
induced models are useful as transplantation models and for investigat-
ing new formulations of insulin and treatments that may prevent beta cell
death (King, 2012).

Research Progress and Gaps

Medical  science  has  made  great  strides  in  treating  type  1  diabetes
and preventing its complications. The nation has built a critical research
infrastructure  to  investigate  the  prevention  of  type  1  diabetes,  includ-
ing  clinical  trial  networks  such  as  TrialNet  and  the  Immune  Tolerance
Network. While there have been a number of clinical trials, only one has
been successful to date in delaying progression to type 1 diabetes. Other
research  infrastructure  includes  large  natural  history  studies,  such  as
TEDDY, DAISY, Germany’s BABYDIAB study,8 and the Type 1 Diabetes
Prediction and Prevention Study,9 many of which NIH funds. These large
birth cohort studies have enabled researchers to investigate the life course
of type 1 diabetes, providing important clues as to the appropriate timing
and approaches for prevention. The Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium
has thoroughly explored the genetics of type 1 diabetes. The SEARCH for
Diabetes in Youth study and other population-based registries, such as the
Colorado and Pittsburgh Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus registries,
have  enabled  researchers  to  determine  the  incidence  and  prevalence  of
type 1 diabetes in the United States.

Technology  advances  are  greatly  simplifying  the  effort  required  by
patients of all ages to monitor and control their blood glucose levels. In
addition,  pancreatic  islet  transplantation  has  shown  benefit  in  patients
with  hard-to-control  blood  glucose  levels  who  are  at  elevated  risk  of
hypoglycemic events (NIDDK, 2018b).

Despite this infrastructure and progress, there remain gaps in knowl-
edge about type 1 diabetes. The planned termination of TEDDY, in 2025
(Clinicaltrials.gov, 2006) illustrates a concern about ending valuable stud-
ies prematurely. This observation study, which has focused on the devel-
opment of autoimmune diseases in newborns at risk of developing type
1  diabetes  (NIDDK,  2021b),  has  gathered  valuable  data  and  samples.
However, with a follow-up of only 15 years, many participants who are
likely  to  develop  disease  will  be  disenrolled  before  clinical  diagnosis,
and disease-associated autoantibodies will not be tracked long enough to
discern natural evolution or clinical outcomes.

8 The German BABYDIAB study was a prospective German multicenter study that moni-
tored  1,353  offspring  of  parents  with  type  1  diabetes  (Ziegler  et  al.,  1999).  Children  were
monitored at birth, 9 months, and 2, 5, and 8 years of age for the temporal development of
autoantibodies.

9 The DIPP Study is a Finnish prospective observational cohort study of infants born with
a  DR-DQ  genotype  associated  with  increased  risk  for  type  1  diabetes  (NLM,  2020).  The
families are invited to have examinations of the infant every 3 months for 2 years, and then
every 12 months until age 15 or until diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

164

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Research  to  identify  the  exact  environmental  triggers  (including
whether or not environmental factors differentially influence risk in dif-
ferent racial and ethnic groups, and gene-environment interactions), and
understand the role of the in utero environment, inflammation, and pan-
creatic beta cell stress in the etiology of type 1 diabetes is necessary. Addi-
tional  investigation  as  to  why  some  individuals  develop  autoimmunity
but do not advance to type 1 diabetes may provide valuable information
regarding  how  to  stop  the  autoimmune  process  from  progressing  and
thus prevent clinical disease. While it is estimated that half of all type 1
diabetes presents after the age of 18, there is a paucity of data on adult-
onset type 1 diabetes.

AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASES

Autoimmune  thyroid  diseases  are  believed  to  be  among  the  most
common  autoimmune  diseases,  and  among  them  are  Hashimoto’s  thy-
roiditis  and  Graves’  disease,  which  are  the  leading  causes  of  hypothy-
roidism and hyperthyroidism, respectively (Franco et al., 2013). In both
of these diseases, autoantibodies attack the thyroid gland. In Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis, this autoantibody attack may have no effect on the thyroid ini-
tially, or it may cause the thyroid to be underactive, or rarely, overactive.
In most individuals, however, the thyroid eventually becomes underac-
tive,  resulting  in  an  enlargement  of  the  thyroid  and  sometimes  fatigue
and  decreased  tolerance  to  cold  (Hershman,  2020a).  In  Graves’  disease,
the thyroid is stimulated to produce and secrete excess thyroid hormones,
which  typically  lead  to  an  enlarged  thyroid  and  increased  bodily  func-
tions  such  as  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure,  which  can  yield  excessive
sweating, anxiety, weight loss, and difficulty sleeping (Hershman, 2020b).
Graves’ disease can also affect the eyes, causing symptoms such as tear-
ing, redness, pain, vision problems, and bulging eyes (Watson, 2021).

Epidemiology and Impact

roid disease can be found in Box 3-11.

Autoimmune Thyroid Disease: Sex, Age,

Racial, and Ethnic Disparities

•	  Up  to  95  percent  of  cases  occur  in  females,  with  onset  typically  in  mid-to-late
adulthood   (Cooper   and   Stroehla,   2003);   epidemiologic   data   are   lacking   for
males because of its scarcity in males

•  Prevalence   of   Hashimoto’s   thyroiditis   is   highest   in   White   females   compared

with  Black  females  (Masi,  1965;  McLeod  et  al.,  2014)
- Prevalence  of  anti-thyroid  antibodies  was  highest  among  White  popula


tions, followed by Mexican American populations, and was lowest in Black
populations  (Hollowell  et  al.,  2002)

Incidence   of   Graves’   disease   among   active   duty   military   personnel   was   sig
nificantly   higher   among   individuals   from   Black   and   Asian   or   Pacific   Islander
populations compared with those from White populations, and trended higher
in  Hispanic  populations  compared  with  White  populations  (McLeod  et  al.,  2014)

Complications, Other Morbidity, and Long-Term Consequences

A  number  of  risks  are  associated  with  hypo-  or  hyper-thyroidism
that  occurs  for  prolonged  periods,  even  if  the  disease  is  subclinical  or
asymptomatic,  such  as  from  undiagnosed  thyroid  disease  or  under- or
overtreatment. Risks include elevated mortality, dementia, cardiovascular
diseases, and osteoporosis (Abrahamsen et al., 2014; Lillevang-Johansen
et al., 2017, 2018, 2019). Women may have an increased risk of infertility,
miscarriage,  and  preterm  delivery,  and  there  may  be  adverse  effects  on
neurodevelopment in their children (Galofre and Davies, 2009). Between
25  and  50  percent  of  individuals  with  Graves’  disease  develop  Graves’
orbitopathy, a condition that can cause eye inflammation, swelling, irri-
tation,  and  pain  as well  as eyelid retraction  and bulging  eyes;  it  can  be
disfiguring and can endanger sight (MedlinePlus, 2020).

Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  thy-
roid cancer (Penta et al., 2018; Resende de Paiva et al., 2017) as is Graves’
disease, particularly in persons with thyroid nodules (Chen et al., 2013;
Staniforth et al., 2016). While findings are mixed regarding an increased
risk of breast cancer in those with Graves’ disease, it is recommended that
these patients be monitored (Chen et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2020).

Persons with an autoimmune thyroid disease are at a greater risk of
developing other autoimmune diseases than persons without an autoim-
mune thyroid disease. One cross-sectional study of more than 3,000 White
UK  patients  with  Graves’  disease  or  Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis  observed
a  relative  risk  greater  than  10.0  of  developing  pernicious  anemia,  SLE,

166

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Addison’s  disease  (particularly  in  men  with  Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis),
myasthenia gravis (in men with Graves’ disease and women with Hashi-
moto’s thyroiditis), celiac disease, vitiligo, and multiple sclerosis (in men
with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) (Boelaert et al., 2010). Sjögren’s disease is
also highly associated with autoimmune thyroid diseases (Baldini et al.,
2018; Rojas-Villarraga et al., 2012).

Individuals with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are at an increased risk of
developing  depression  and  anxiety  disorders  (Siegmann  et  al.,  2018).
Depression is common in Graves’ disease (Fukao et al., 2020), and expe-
riencing disfigurement increases emotional distress (Farid et al., 2005).

Economic Impact

A study  published  in  2021  estimated  that  annual  per  patient  medi-
cal costs related to hypothyroidism ranged from $460 to $2,555 (Hepp et
al., 2021). However, this study was not restricted to autoimmune hypo-
thyroidism and did not assess the economic costs of Graves’ disease or
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

Risk Factors and Etiology

A temporal increase in disease incidence over a relatively short time,
such as that observed in the Rochester, Minnesota, population for auto-
immune  thyroid  diseases,  supports  the  hypothesis  that  environmental
factors play a key role in the development of disease. Dietary factors are
leading contenders among suspected risk factors. There is some evidence
that in iodine-sufficient areas, excess iodine intake may be associated with
development of hypothyroidism in susceptible individuals (Konno et al.,
1994; Laurberg et al., 1998; Sundick et al., 1992). While iodine is essential
for  normal  thyroid  function,  both  deficient  and  excessive  intake  have
been  associated  with  autoimmune  thyroid  disease.  Selenium  deficiency
is  another  dietary  factor  that  has  been  linked  to  autoimmune  thyroid
disease, and studies of supplementation among persons with subclinical
hypothyroidism have suggested reduction in markers of thyroid autoim-
munity (Duntas et al., 2003; Gärtner et al., 2002).

Smoking  is  associated  with  autoimmune  thyroid  disease;  a  meta-
analysis  reported  an  odds  ratio  of  3.3  for  Graves’  disease  in  current
smokers compared with non-smokers. (Vestergaard, 2002). Data suggest
that smoking is particularly relevant to the development of Graves’ oph-
thalmopathy (Hägg and Asplund, 1987; Prummel and Wiersinga, 1993).
Studies have shown that a number of toxins, including polychlorinated
biphenyls,  phthalates,  bisphenol  A,  and  brominated  flame  retardants,
may  have  thyroid-disrupting  effects,  but  long-term  epidemiologic  data

OVERVIEW OF SELECT AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

167

assessing  exposures  over  varying  developmental  stages,  including  in
utero, are needed to determine whether these substances play any role in
the development of autoimmune thyroid disease (Boas et al., 2012).

Investigators have also postulated that infectious agents play a role in
the development of autoimmune thyroid diseases, with evidence accumu-
lating in  particular  for  hepatitis  C  (Deutsch  et al.,  1997)  and  its  treatment
with interferon-α  (IFNα).  Clinical or  subclinical  thyroid  disease  develops
in   approximately  40   percent  of   patients   with   hepatitis   C   treated   with
IFNα.  IFNα-induced   thyroiditis   is   thought  to   result  from   both   immune
effects   and   direct  toxicity  on   the   thyroid,   with  both  autoimmune   and
non-autoimmune  thyroiditis  observed  in  association  with  this  therapy
(Menconi  et al.,  2011).

Genetic susceptibility also plays a key role in both Hashimoto’s thy-
roiditis  and  Graves’  disease,  with  family  studies  demonstrating  high
sibling  risk  ratios  and  twin  concordance  (Tomer,  2014).  Research  has
implicated  both  thyroid-specific  genes  such  as  those  coding  for  thyro-
globulin  and  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  receptor,  and  immune-regu-
latory genes. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’ disease share most of
the susceptibility genes, and several are also shared with other autoim-
mune diseases (Tomer, 2014). Most of the susceptibility genes identified
from genome-wide association studies have low odds ratios (Chu et al.,
2011;  Cooper  et  al.,  2012;  Hodge  and  Greenberg,  2016),  pointing  to  the
importance  of  genomic  interactions  with  environmental  factors.  Recent
research supports the role of epigenetic modulation in the development
of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’ disease (Tomer, 2014).

Diagnostic Tools

While symptoms of autoimmune thyroid disease are generally non-
specific,  such  as  weight  change,  changes  in  appetite,  fatigue,  and  dry
skin,  diagnosis  relies  on  objective  laboratory  testing  for  thyroid  hor-
mone,  thyroid–stimulating  hormone,  and  autoantibodies.  The  major
autoantibodies  include  anti-thyroid  peroxidase,  anti-thyroglobulin,  and
anti-thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (Frohlich and Wahl,
2017).  These  autoantibodies  are  highly  prevalent  among  patients  with
autoimmune thyroid disease, but are not specific in that they can also be
observed in persons without thyroid disease.

Treatments and Prospects for Cures

Although clinical guidelines for autoimmune thyroid diseases have
been  updated,  the  standard  therapies  for  autoimmune  thyroid  diseases
have remained stagnant for several decades, are associated with serious

168

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

complications, and do not target underlying autoimmune processes (Yoo
and Chung, 2016). Anti-thyroid medications, thyroid ablation with radio-
active  iodine,  or  surgery  are  treatments  for  Graves’  hyperthyroidism.
Potential  toxicities  of  anti-thyroid  medications  include  agranulocytosis,
liver  toxicity,  and  birth  defects  (Andersen  et  al.,  2013;  Cooper,  2005),
and the use of these medications is largely limited to serving as a bridge
therapy prior to radioiodine or thyroidectomy. Radioiodine can trigger or
worsen  Graves’  ophthalmopathy,  may  increase  risk  of  breast  and  other
solid  cancers  (Kitahara  et  al.,  2019),  and  is  associated  with  pregnancy
complications  for  up  to  3  to  5  years  after  treatment.  Risks  associated
with thyroidectomy include vocal cord paralysis and hypocalcemia. Thy-
roid  hormone  replacement is  used  following radioiodine  therapy or  thy-
roidectomy  for  Graves’  disease  as  well  as  for  treatment  of  Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis.   However,   inconsistent  absorption   and   bioavailability  create
challenges  in  achieving  appropriate  levels,  with  over  half  of  patients
undergoing thyroid  hormone  replacement failing to  have  normal  thyroid
hormone  levels  (Somwaru  et al.,  2009).  In addition,  bioequivalence  may
vary between thyroxine  products,  such  as  between  brands  and  generics,
and  since  imprecise  treatment can  have  adverse  effects,  it is  important to
switch brands  with caution and  to  use appropriate monitoring (Benvenga
and  Carlé,  2019).

There  is  a  great  need  for  targeted  therapies  that  address  immuno-
logical aspects of autoimmune thyroid diseases and that have fewer side
effects, and there have been promising advances in that regard. Teprotu-
mumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits insulin-like growth factor-1
receptor,  was  originally  investigated  as  a  cancer  treatment  but  received
FDA approval in 2020 for treatment of Graves’ opthalmopathy (Kahaly et
al., 2021; Slentz et al., 2020).

A  novel  anti-CD40  monoclonal  antibody,  iscalimab,  is  currently  in
clinical trials for treatment of Graves’ disease (Kahaly et al., 2020). This
therapy builds on several years of basic and translational research eluci-
dating the role of CD40 in Graves’ disease, as well as other autoimmune
diseases  (Jacobson  et  al.,  2005;  Tomer  et  al.,  2002).  Ongoing  research  is
investigating  a  personalized  medicine  approach  for  this  treatment  that
aims to determine whether response can be predicted based on genotype.
Another promising compound for treatment of autoimmune thyroid
disease is cepharanthine, which is currently in preclinical studies (Li et al.,
2016, 2020). This small molecule blocks binding of thyroglobulin peptide
and presentation to T cells, providing a targeted immunosuppression. It
also represents another therapy that may offer a personalized treatment
approach, predicted to be relevant for a subset of approximately one-third
of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.

Animal Models

Experimental  autoimmune  thyroiditis  can  be  induced  by  immu-
nization  of  genetically  susceptible  animals  with  human  thyroglobulin
in  an  adjuvant  and  has  served  as  a  model  for  Hashimoto’s  thyroiditis
(Kong, 2007). Graves’ hyperthyroidism can be induced by injecting cells
expressing  the  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  receptor  or  by  vaccinating
with  thyroid-stimulating  hormone  receptor-encoding  DNA  in  plasmid
or  adenoviral  vectors  (McLachlan  et  al.,  2005).  More  recently,  research-
ers have used the NOD.H-2h4 mice, one of relatively few animal models
to  spontaneously  develop  organ-specific  autoimmune  diseases  without
immunization  with  antigen  and  adjuvant,  as  a  model  of  autoimmune
thyroiditis (Braley-Mullen and Yu, 2015).

Research Progress and Gaps

FDA  approval  in  2020  of  a  monoclonal  antibody  for  treatment  of
Graves’ opthalmopathy represented a major advance in this field, where
the  majority  of  treatments  have  remained  unchanged  over  decades.
Despite  progress  in  understanding  of  molecular  mechanisms  driving
autoimmune  thyroid  diseases,  there  remains  a  need  to  improve  under-
standing  of  risk  factors  and  disease  mechanisms  and  to  translate  these
findings  into  development  or  repurposing  of  targeted  interventions  for
prevention  or  treatment.  Improved  characterization  of  biomarkers  and
their  implications  for  diagnosis  is  also  needed  in  order  to  personalize
screening  and  treatment  approaches.  Given  the  challenges  and  compli-
cations  related  to  both  undiagnosed  and  treated  autoimmune  thyroid
diseases  during  preconception  and  pregnancy,  special  consideration  to
reproductive issues should be integrated into research. Additionally, stud-
ies are needed to assess the economic costs and impact of Graves’ disease
and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

SUMMARY AND RESEARCH IMPLICATONS

Sjögren’s  disease,  SLE,  APS,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  psoriasis,  IBD,
celiac disease, PBC, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and autoimmune
thyroid  diseases  are  well-studied  representatives  of  organ-specific  and
systemic autoimmune diseases. These illnesses share genetic, cell-biology,
and etiologic mechanisms in diverse ways that with further study could
lead  to  identifying  specific  autoimmune  mechanisms  involved  in  these
diseases. Several treatment interventions are shared among some autoim-
mune diseases.

Most of these autoimmune diseases are female predominant, though
they differ in median age of onset and racial and ethnic distributions. For

170

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

several, however, epidemiological studies are inadequate or nonexistent.
Such studies should be encouraged to fully understand the incidence and
prevalence  of  these  diseases  and  any  racial-,  ethnic-,  or  gender-related
disparities.  Like  all  autoimmune  diseases,  the  diseases  reviewed  above
are chronic illnesses; some are lethal, others are disabling, and some are
neither. With regard to pregnancy, autoimmune diseases and their treat-
ments  may  affect  both  mother  and  fetus.  Treatment  options  vary,  with
some diseases lacking FDA-approved treatment options altogether. None
is easy to treat. None has a known cure.

Autoimmune diseases are heterogeneous. For some, diagnostic test-
ing  is  well-established  and  diagnosis  relatively  straightforward.  For
others, diagnostic markers may be nonspecific, and final diagnosis may
depend on variable combinations of symptoms, signs, laboratory mark-
ers, responses to treatment, genetics, and environmental exposure studies.
For this latter group of autoimmune diseases, it is imperative to identify
more  specific  diagnostic  markers,  both  for  the  purposes  of  diagnosing
these diseases as early as possible and to support efforts to develop effec-
tive therapeutics.

Co-occurrence of autoimmune diseases in individual patients is com-
mon. Complications arising from disease-inflicted damage and/or from
treatment, occurring over prolonged periods of time, may hinder identifi-
cation of broadly applicable interventions. In addition, a lack of standards
for recording diagnosis codes and metrics for assessing outcomes make it
difficult to determine the cost of care, disability, and mortality.

Animal  models  provide  insight  into  pathophysiologic  mechanisms
of autoimmune disease to varying degrees, though no animal model per-
fectly recapitulates human autoimmune disease. Still, basic mechanisms
of immune function and immune dysregulation can be more easily stud-
ied in appropriate animal models for specific diseases to provide a more
directed,  hypothesis-driven  study  of  disease  mechanisms  in  humans.
Thus the value of animal models should be appreciated, and studies that
develop new animal models or advance existing models are encouraged.
Despite the ambiguities, understanding the genetics, involvement of
environmental  exposures,  and  pathogenic  mechanisms  of  autoimmune
diseases  suggest  possibilities  for  initiatives  to  prevent  disease.  The  sec-
ond-hit hypothesis—that individuals may be genetically predisposed to
develop  clinical  illness  but  do  not  do  so  unless  and  until  exposures  or
events  occur—is  a  theme  common  to  all  autoimmune  diseases  and  one
that merits further study, including whether such exposures or events dif-
ferentially influence risk in specific ethnic and racial populations.

There are barriers to studying autoimmune diseases when there are
rigid classification criteria for enrolling individuals with an autoimmune

disease  diagnosis  in  a  study.10  Among  these  are  the  prolonged  time
between autoimmunity onset and diagnosis, resulting from the absence
of sensitive diagnostic biomarkers and clinician awareness of early dis-
ease manifestations; disease heterogeneity, including pre-diagnosis and in
individuals who have overlapping autoimmune disease or who present
atypically;  and  coexisting  illnesses.  Collaborative  studies,  using  broad
diagnostic criteria, provide opportunities to improve etiological, mecha-
nistic, treatment, and outcome knowledge that could be applied to more
patients and improve overall patient care.

Among the autoimmune diseases discussed in this chapter, no indi-
vidual disease represents a full range of comprehensive studies or char-
acterization.  Sjögren’s  disease,  for  example,  represents  a  complex  auto-
immune  disease  that  targets  common  self-antigens,  disproportionately
affects  women,  and  may  affect  individuals  across  the  life  course.  But
limiting epidemiological studies in Sjögren’s disease to individuals with
no co-occurring autoimmune disease has greatly hindered characteriza-
tion  of  the  full  impact  of  Sjögren’s  disease.  Other  diseases  have  been
better  characterized  through  epidemiological  studies,  including  SLE,
rheumatoid arthritis, IBD, and type 1 diabetes. Studies have best exam-
ined  economic  impact  for  the  gastrointestinal  diseases  IBD  and  PBC.
Type 1 diabetes represents a model autoimmune disease in that extensive
study has identified autoantibodies to predict disease development and
to enable intervention studies in individuals at highest risk for develop-
ing autoimmunity. Ultimately, this represents a key goal in autoimmune
disease research—defining highly at-risk individuals and intervening to
prevent progression to disease. Together these autoimmune diseases rep-
resent  successes  and  gaps  in  our  understanding  that  can  be  considered
in the future funding and coordination of autoimmune disease research.

10 Many systemic autoimmune diseases are predictable before they are diagnosable. For
example, many patients who later develop SLE, type 1 diabetes, or PBC have blood test ab-
normalities—typically the presence of autoantibodies, which are sometimes associated with
genetic markers—that antedate the onset of clinical illness by a decade. Similarly, a limited
form of neurological illness known as clinically isolated syndrome may precede diagnos-
able multiple sclerosis. And nonspecific IBD may precede diagnosable Crohn’s disease or
ulcerative colitis. The predictive power of pre-disease is not high, since many pre-disease
patients do not progress to diagnosable disease. In most cases, it is unknown whether the
differences between pre-disease and diagnosable disease reflect disease severity or chronol-
ogy of disease pathogenesis. Clinicians, scientists, and administrators disagree whether pre-
disease patients should be included in studies and conversations about specific diagnoses.

Crosscutting Issues in

Autoimmune Diseases

In Chapter 1 and Chapter 3, the committee highlighted unique and
heterogeneous features of specific autoimmune diseases. In contrast, this
chapter  examines  common  features  found  among  many  autoimmune
diseases.  Because  discussion  applies  to  autoimmune  diseases  as  a  cat-
egory of diseases, the 11 diseases of focus as well as other autoimmune
diseases, such as alopecia areata, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, myocarditis,
spondyloarthropathy, systemic sclerosis (also known as scleroderma), and
vasculitis, are referenced.

COMMONALITIES ACROSS AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

While every autoimmune disease has its unique characteristics, many
of  them  also  share  common  features  that  researchers  believe—and  evi-
dence   supports—suggest  that  there   are   common   mechanisms   involved
in  the  etiology of  autoimmune  diseases.  For  example,  the  fact that auto-
immune  diseases  tend  to  occur  in  family clusters  suggests  that there  are
common genetic  and  environmental  factors  involved  in  triggering auto-
immunity  and   disease   symptoms.   Research   shows   that  genetic   factors
alone   cannot  explain   the   etiology  of   any  autoimmune   disease,   and   that
environmental  agents  or  insults—infectious  microorganisms  and  respira-
tory  and   dietary  exposures   are   leading  candidates   for   several   autoim-
mune diseases—are  interacting with those  genetic  factors  to  produce  the
disease   state.   Certain   types   of   proinflammatory  immune   responses   and
the  presence  of  autoantibodies  are  two  other  common  features.  Finally,

223

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

multiple autoimmune diseases show sex differences in disease incidence
and  severity.  The  discussion  below  highlights  how  these  commonali-
ties, as well as common mechanistic pathways, can serve as therapeutic
targets.

Genetics

Research  suggests  strongly  that  autoimmunity  leading  to  autoim-
mune  disease  requires  at  least  one,  but  likely  more  than  one,  gene
(Sogkas  et  al.,  2021)  that  interacts  with  environmental  factors.  The
gene–environment relationship is complex, with environmental changes
altering genes through epigenetic modifications that not only affect that
individual  but  subsequent  offspring  (Cavalli  and  Heard,  2019;  Surace
and Hedrich, 2019). Epigenetic factors could contribute to early onset of
some  autoimmune  diseases  such  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (Meyer  et
al.,  2015).  Individuals  with  one  autoimmune  disease  are  more  likely  to
develop  another  autoimmune  disease  (Cojocaru  et  al.,  2010),  and  auto-
immune  diseases,  although  often  not  the  same  autoimmune  disease,
typically cluster in families (Shamim and Miller, 2000). In addition, auto-
antibodies are more likely to develop in family members, whether symp-
tomatic  or  not,  of  an  individual  with  an  autoimmune  disease  (James  et
al.,  2019;  Leslie  et  al.,  2001).  These  findings,  along  with  the  observation
that autoimmune diseases run in families, lead the research community
to believe that common mechanisms increase autoimmunity in genetically
susceptible individuals.

Human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA),  or  HLA  haplotype,  is  the  best
available  predictor  of  developing  an  autoimmune  disease  (Bacon  et  al.,
1974;  Cooper  et  al.,  1999;  Matzaraki  et  al.,  2017)  and  is  directly  related
to  increased  autoantibodies  in  family  members  (Wong  and  Wen,  2003),
though it does not appear to be the only region of the genome where dif-
ferent autoimmune diseases have genes in common (Cho and Gregersen,
2011;  Cooper  et  al.,  1999).  Many  of  the  genes  that  confer  susceptibility
to  autoimmune  disease  and  that  different  autoimmune  diseases  share
regulate  the  immune  response  (Sogkas  et  al.,  2021).  Some  autoimmune
diseases  with  different  clinical  characteristics,  including  which  organs
are  affected,  share  genetic  variants,  indicating  that  these  diseases  may
share  some  common  pathways  of  immune  dysfunction  (see  Figure  4-1
and Figure 4-2). This supports the suggestion that the specific organs tar-
geted in individuals with similar genetic risk variants, such as in families
with multiple affected individuals, may require an additional factor such
as an environmental exposure for disease to progress. In addition to the
11  diseases  of  focus,  Figure  4-1  and  Figure  4-2  include  systemic  sclero-
sis,  spondyloarthropathy,  primary  sclerosing  cholangitis,  and  juvenile

idiopathic  arthritis,  further  highlighting  commonalities  among  autoim-
mune diseases.

Determining genetic risk for autoimmune disease is complex because
many  different  genes  may  be  associated  with  the  risk  for  the  disease.
Polygenic risk scores are used to convert the complexity of the multiple
genetic  risk  variants  into  a  single  quantified  measure  (NHGRI,  2020).
Studies defining polygenic risk scores for specific autoimmune diseases
have demonstrated potential utility in diagnosis, prognosis, and molecu-
lar subsetting of autoimmune diseases. Recent studies in systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) found associations of increased organ damage and
mortality in individuals with high genetic risk scores (Reid et al., 2020).
Another study focused on genes in different immunological pathways in
order to identify different molecular subsets of individuals with SLE based
on pathway-specific genetic risk scores (Sandling et al., 2021). Genetic risk
scores have been used in studies of other autoimmune diseases such as
type 1 diabetes (Sharp et al., 2018), multiple sclerosis (de Mol et al., 2020;
van Pelt et al., 2013), and systemic sclerosis (Bossini-Castillo et al., 2021).
In  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD),  genetic  risk  scoring  is  less  well-
established  but  shows  some  promise  (Abakkouy  and  Cleynen,  2021).
Advantages of genetic risk scores include the ease of a standardized mea-
surement  and  the  absence  of  disease  activity-based  variability  that  can
complicate measures of other disease-associated biomarkers (Sharp et al.,
2018). Disadvantages include risk scores that represent relative risk rather
than absolute risk, and that their applicability to the general population
will  require  studying  more  diverse  populations.  Much  of  the  available
genomics  data  are  based  on  individuals  of  European  ancestry,  which
makes the relevance of these risk scores less clear for other populations
(NHGRI,  2020).  Moreover,  the  overlap  in  genetic  risk  between  autoim-
mune diseases such as systemic sclerosis and SLE, Sjögren’s disease, or
rheumatoid  arthritis  may  preclude  the  ability  to  accurately  distinguish
the  diseases  based  on  genetic  risk  scores  alone  (Bossini-Castillo  et  al.,
2021). Thus, additional studies are needed to overcome the limitations of
polygenic risk scores before they can be used clinically, but such studies
are warranted to help shift the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune
diseases to prediction and prevention.

Despite clear associations between genetic variants of immune-related
genes  and  specific  autoimmune  diseases,  a  complete  understanding  of
the specific effects of these variants in the pathogenesis of these diseases
is  lacking.  The  altered  biological  functions  of  the  genetic  variants  and
their  roles  in  immune  dysregulation  remain  gaps  in  our  knowledge  of
the genotype–phenotype relationships of disease-associated genetic vari-
ants. An important focus of future research will be to systematically map
the  biologic  function  of  genetic  variants  for  the  different  autoimmune
diseases. Defining the functions of variant-related immune pathways is

228

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

critical as this knowledge can inform clinical approaches to modulate the
dysregulated or overactive immune pathways. The same pathway may or
may not function the same way across diseases. For example, the patho-
genic role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in rheumatoid arthritis, inflam-
matory  bowel  disease,  and  psoriasis  led  to  targeting  therapies  to  block
TNF  to  treat  these  diseases  (Jang  et  al.,  2021),  but  TNF  inhibitors  have
negative effects in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (Kemanetzoglou and
Andreadou, 2017). In some individuals without multiple sclerosis, treat-
ment with TNF inhibitors can cause multiple sclerosis-like demyelination
(Kemanetzoglou and Andreadou, 2017). Despite effectively treating pso-
riasis in many individuals, the use of TNF inhibitors may also induce pso-
riasis (Mazloom et al., 2020). Similarly, genetic variants may have opposite
effects in different autoimmune diseases and be associated with protective
effects  in  some  autoimmune  diseases  but  with  increased  risk  in  others
(Dendrou  et  al.,  2016;  Wang  et  al.,  2010).  Beyond  associations  of  gene

variants with autoimmune diseases, altered expression of genes through
epigenetic modifications may drive differential effects of immune-related
genes (Mazzone et al., 2019).

Finding: Studies of genetics in autoimmune diseases have identified
genes associated with specific autoimmune diseases. The overlap in
genes associated with different autoimmune diseases underscores the
contribution of non-genetic factors, such as environmental exposures,
in determining which organ systems are targeted by the autoimmune
response,  but  the  mechanisms  of  the  genotype–phenotype  associa-
tions are not known.

Finding: Studies have consolidated the complex gene variants into a
single genetic risk score to define genetic risk for a specific autoim-
mune disease. However, the majority of available data driving genetic
risk scores are based on individuals of European ancestry.

Conclusion:   Genetic  risks  are  common  and  often  overlapping  in  autoim
mune diseases,  but  more research  is needed  to  define these risks in different
populations  in  order  to  develop  more  widely  applicable  genetic  risk  scores
and  to  promote studies to  define genotype-phenotype associations.

Environmental Factors

Studies of the incidence of autoimmune disease in identical and fra-
ternal twins show that autoimmune diseases may require an environmen-
tal signal or exposure to develop (Figure 4-3). Nationwide or population-
based  twin  registry  or  cohort  studies  comparing  the  incidence  of  SLE
(Ulff-Møller  et  al.,  2018),  type  1  diabetes  (Nistico  et  al.,  2012),  multiple
sclerosis (Willer et al., 2003), and Graves’ disease (Brix et al., 2001) find
probandwise concordance rates of 25 to 45 percent in identical twins and
much lower rates, ranging from 5 to 16 percent, in fraternal twins, imply-
ing strong genetic factors and the need for a “second hit”—presumably
environmental  exposure—for  the  development  of  autoimmune  disease.
Investigators found a lower concordance rate of 9.1 percent in identical
twins in rheumatoid arthritis, similar to the 6.4 percent concordance rate
seen in fraternal twins (Svendsen et al., 2013). In systemic sclerosis, iden-
tical and fraternal twins both had a 5 percent concordance rate (Feghali-
Bostwick  et  al.,  2003),  suggesting  more  environmental  and  less  genetic
influence on disease development.

Because they depend on diagnosis definition and duration of obser-
vation,  concordance  rates  may  mislead.  For  example,  in  a  restudy  that
applied new technology to examine twin concordance rates fifteen years

230

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

after an earlier study, the researchers showed that SLE markers had been
present in the well twins of the earlier study (Reichlin et al., 1992), and
thus the well twins had been serologically but not clinically concordant
with their siblings. The restudy also showed that some well twins devel-
oped clinical illness, becoming clinically concordant, decades after their
twin siblings were first diagnosed. These observations strongly support
the “second-hit” hypothesis, which holds that a genetic profile requires
an additional exposure event to become clinical illness. Examples of expo-
sures  associated  with  autoimmune  diseases  include  infectious  agents,
pesticides, solvents, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, occupational expo-
sure  to  respirable  particulates  and  fibers,  and  personal  factors  such  as
cigarette-smoking history and diet preferences (Cooper et al., 2009; Cun-
ningham, 2019; Diegel et al., 2018; Hahn et al., 2022; Khan and Wang, 2019;
Parks et al., 1999; Popescu et al., 2021).

Infections

For some autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatic fever, myocarditis,
multiple  sclerosis,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  and  SLE,  research  has  identified
a  causal  link between  bacterial  or  viral  infection  and  the  development of
disease (Bjornevik et  al., 2022; Cunningham, 2019; Fairweather et al., 2001,
2003;  Fechtner  et al.,  2021;  Jog et al.,  2019;  Lanz  et al.,  2022;  McClain et al.,
2005).  For  example,  data  have  found  that infection  with or  reactivation of
Epstein-Barr  virus  precedes  development of  multiple  sclerosis,  rheuma-
toid  arthritis,  and  SLE  (Bjornevik et al., 2022;  Fechtner  et al.,  2021;  Jog et
al.,  2019;  Lanz  et al.,  2022;  McClain  et al.,  2005).

Additionally, research has found associations between type 1 diabetes
and   coxsackievirus   and   cytomegalovirus   infections   (Fairweather   et  al.,
2001;   Rodriguez-Calvo,   2019);   multiple   sclerosis   and   Epstein-Barr   virus
(Bjornevik et al.,  2022)  and  measles  infections  (Mentis  et al.,  2017;  Pers-
son  et al.,  2014;  Tucker  and  Andrew  Paskauskas,  2008);  and  rheumatoid
arthritis  and  mycobacteria  and  Epstein-Barr  virus  infections  (Fairweather
et al.,  2012).  However,  most of  the  associations  between  infectious  agents
and   autoimmune   diseases   are   considered   to   be   circumstantial.   Linking
an   infection  to   an  autoimmune   disease   is   problematic   because   there   is
usually an extended period between the infection and the appearance of
clinical  autoimmune  disease.  The  best evidence  that infectious  agents  can
cause autoimmune disease comes from animal studies in which research-
ers administered self-antigens with adjuvant incorporating non-infectious
microbial   antigens   (Fairweather   et  al.,   2001).   A   variation   on   the   classic
experimental   autoimmune   model   uses   an   injection   of   heart-  or   salivary
gland-derived  cytomegalovirus  or  coxsackievirus  B3  as  the  trigger  to

induce myocarditis, which is associated with the development of autoan-
tibodies against cardiac myosin (Fairweather et al., 2001).

Some of the best clinical evidence that viral infections can cause an
autoimmune disease comes from the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause myo-
carditis,  which  occurs  in  approximately  4.5  percent  of  COVID-19  cases
(Kawakami  et  al.,  2021).  SARS-CoV-2  has  also  been  associated  with  the
production  of  multiple  autoantibodies  and  the  development  of  autoim-
mune diseases besides myocarditis such as antiphospholipid syndrome,
Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Kawasaki disease (Dotan et al., 2021). The
production of autoantibodies after viral infections is a feature of animal
models of virally induced autoimmune disease (Fairweather et al., 2001),
further indicating this as an important area for future investigation. Mul-
tiple diverse microorganisms have been associated with a single autoim-
mune  disease—for  example,  several  different  viral  infections  are  asso-
ciated  with  myocarditis—which  suggests  that  infectious  agents  induce
autoimmune  disease  through  common  mechanisms  (Fairweather  and
Rose,  2006).  Similarly,  infection  by  one  microorganism  may  induce  dif-
ferent  autoimmune  diseases.  Coxsackievirus  is  associated  with  type  1
diabetes (Rodriguez-Calvo, 2019), autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis) (Mori and Yoshida, 2010), and myocarditis (Tam, 2006), and
in  children,  SARS-CoV-2  infection  is  linked  to  myocarditis  (Boehmer  et
al., 2021) and Kawasaki-like inflammatory disease (Dotan et al., 2021) as
well as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (Consiglio et al., 2020). The
inflammatory  response  to  infection  may  play  a  greater  role  in  causing
autoimmunity  than  the  specific  infectious  agent;  the  inflammation  acti-
vates common pathogenic mechanisms that cause autoimmune disease.
Inherent in this observation is that common innate immune factors such
as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and/or TLR4 are able to initiate the autoim-
mune response to infectious agents (Mohammad Hosseini et al., 2015).

There are a number of theories for how infections or other environ-
mental agents can trigger autoimmunity and autoimmune disease. These
include (Cavalli and Heard, 2019; Fairweather and Rose, 2006; Surace and
Hedrich, 2019):


	 direct viral damage;

release of cryptic self-peptides, which are antigens that are nor-
mally exposed to the immune system in such low amounts that
the body has not developed self-tolerance1  to them;

1 Self-tolerance refers to the immune system’s tolerance to the body’s own antigens (self-
antigens). By this mechanism, the immune system prevents the production of functional B
cells and T cells that react to self-antigens and prevents the body from directing an immune
response against itself. Impairment of this mechanism leads to autoimmunity and produc-
tion of autoantibodies against self-antigens (Hale et al., 2005).

232

antigenic  spread,  which  occurs  when  the  immune  system’s
response  to  a  microbial  antigen  expands  to  include  similar
self-antigens;

	 molecular  mimicry,  which  occurs  when  a  microbial  antigen


closely resembles a self-antigen;
epigenetics;

•	  bystander activation, which occurs when the immune system is
activated in an antigen-independent manner and then produces
a cytokine storm; and
an  adjuvant  effect,  which  occurs  when  a  microbial  antigen  or
chemical adjuvant activates the innate immune response to self-
tissue. Support for the latter comes from animal experiments in
which researchers induce autoimmune disease using self-peptides
and  adjuvants;  examples  include  inducing  rheumatoid  arthritis
by  administering  collagen  with  an  adjuvant,  multiple  sclerosis
by inoculating with myelin basic protein with an adjuvant, and
myocarditis by injecting cardiac myosin with an adjuvant.

Other  hypotheses  hold  that  co-infections  with  bacteria  and  viruses
are necessary to induce autoimmune disease or that autoimmunity may
occur  commonly  as  a  normal  response  needed  to  clear  damaged  self
(Root-Bernstein and Fairweather, 2015).

Respiratory Exposures: Silica, Asbestos, and Tobacco Smoke

The  research  pertaining  to  respirable  silica  exposure  and  systemic
autoimmune  diseases—rheumatoid  arthritis,  SLE,  systemic  sclerosis,
and various forms of small-vessel vasculitis—spans more than 100 years
(Parks  et  al.,  1999). A robust  set  of  studies,  with  highly  consistent  find-
ings from a variety of populations and settings and using different study
designs, have demonstrated at least a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of devel-
oping  each  of  those  diseases  associated  with  occupational  exposure  to
silica (Figure 4-4). The figure’s inclusion of data on 2 of the 11 diseases of
focus as well as systemic sclerosis and vasculitis highlights the risk silica
exposure carries across autoimmune diseases.

Studies have also investigated immune-related effects of silica in the
lung.  Silica  stimulates  macrophages  and  also  leads  to  their  destruction,
releasing  intracellular  self-antigens  and  stimulating  proinflammatory
cytokines,  including  interleukin  1  (IL-1)  and  TNF,  and  eventually  acti-
vating the innate and adaptive immune response in the lungs and other
tissues (Bates et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2003; Chauhan et al., 2021; Cooper
et al., 2008; Foster et al., 2019). Studies of a breed of mice susceptible to
SLE have examined the mechanisms by which inhaled silica induces both

development  and  exacerbation  of  SLE  and  activates  immune  responses
outside the lung (Bates et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2003; Chauhan et al., 2021;
Foster et al., 2019). Examining silica in combination with other exposures
has also been revealing. A recent study using a breed of mice that is not
prone to autoimmune disease found that an early-life exposure to lym-
phocytic choriomeningitis virus followed later by a single high-intensity
airway exposure to silica in the adult mice produced lupus-related auto-
antibodies and kidney lesions (Gonzalez-Quintial et al., 2019).

Recent research has expanded the interest in respirable exposures to
other particles and fibers. Several studies have examined systemic auto-
immune diseases and autoantibodies in populations exposed to various
forms of asbestos and asbestiform particles in Montana and in Australia,
Italy, Korea, and Sweden (Carey et al., 2021; Diegel et al., 2018; Ilar et al.,
2019; Lee et al., 2020; Noonan et al., 2006; Pfau et al., 2018; Rapisarda et
al., 2018; Reid et al., 2018), and experimental studies have examined the
effects of asbestos on macrophages, T cells, and cytokine profiles (Ferro et
al., 2014; Khaliullin et al., 2020; Kumagai-Takei et al., 2020). An emerging
area of research is exploring the effects on inflammation and autoimmune
disease of a severe and sudden high-intensity mixture of respirable expo-
sures, or the combination of these exposures with highly stressful condi-
tions,  such  as  experienced  during  the  September  11,  2001,  World  Trade
Center attacks and during natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsu-
namis. With respect to the respirable occupational exposures noted above,
the question of relevant exposure level—the combination of intensity and
duration  needed  to  induce  autoimmune  disease—and  whether  current
occupational  exposure  limits  are  sufficient  to  prevent  adverse  autoim-
mune disease, is a crucial question that further research needs to address.
Cigarette smoking is a well-studied risk factor for many forms of can-
cer, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions, and for some autoim-
mune diseases there are relatively strong data supporting an association,
including evidence of a dose–response relationship between the intensity
and  duration  of  cigarette  smoking  and  the  likelihood  of  developing  an
autoimmune disease. This is seen, for example, with rheumatoid arthritis,
particularly in people with rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein
peptide antibodies (Costenbader and Karlson, 2006; Liu et al., 2019), and
Graves’  disease,  particularly  in  people  with  Graves’  ophthalmopathy
(Vestergaard, 2002). Studies have identified weaker associations between
current  smoking  and  SLE  and  multiple  sclerosis  (Belbasis  et  al.,  2015;
Parisis et al., 2019). Somewhat paradoxically, smoking is associated with
an increased risk and severity of Crohn’s disease, but with a reduced risk
of developing ulcerative colitis (Piovani et al., 2021); smoking cessation
has been shown to increase the risk of developing ulcerative colitis in the
Western world (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2020). Studies in Western cohorts,

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

237

however, have consistently demonstrated that smoking increases the risk
and severity of Crohn’s disease (Ananthakrishnan et al., 2020). Research
has also found that smoking is associated with severity, progression, risk
of flares, or treatment effectiveness in several other autoimmune diseases
(Costenbader and Karlson, 2006; Hedström et al., 2021; Parisis et al., 2019;
Simmons et al., 2021).

Other Occupational and Environmental Exposures

Studies have examined the relationship of exposure to the broad cate-
gory of solvents and the development of several autoimmune diseases. In
2010, an expert panel concluded that evidence from epidemiologic studies
provided “confidence that solvent exposure contributes to the develop-
ment of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma),” while the panel considered a
link  between  solvent  exposure  and  multiple  sclerosis  to  be  “likely  but
requiring confirmation” (Miller et al., 2012; Parks et al., 2014). Regarding
specific solvents, studies of trichloroethylene exposure in animal models
found disease acceleration in lupus-prone mice, markers of inflammatory
response,  and  the  development  of  autoimmune  hepatitis,  inflammatory
skin lesions, and alopecia. Human studies have produced similar findings
in workers exposed to trichloroethylene (Cooper et al., 2009). There is a
need  for  further  research  focusing  on  the  effects  of  specific  solvents  in
experimental and epidemiologic studies.

Endocrine-disrupting  chemicals—bisphenol  A  (BPA),  a  variety  of
phthalates, polybrominated flame retardants, perchlorate, perfluorinated
chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, and some types of pesti-
cides and herbicides, among others—are another broad category of com-
pounds of particular relevance to the general population because of the
potential  for  exposure  through  environmental  contamination  as  well  as
through  food,  food  packaging,  and  personal  care  and  home  products
(Diamanti-Kandarakis  et  al.,  2009).  Exposure  to  endocrine-disrupting
chemicals  in  utero  also  carries  the  potential  to  affect  DNA methylation
and genomic imprinting; this early-life exposure can carry risk for disease
even in adulthood (Robles-Matos et al., 2021). Biomonitoring data from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey have revealed a
high prevalence and widely varying levels of exposure to many of these
compounds  in  the  U.S.  population  (EPA,  2021).  Endocrine-disrupting
chemicals such as phenols (e.g., BPA), parabens, and phthalates have been
shown to influence sex hormone activity and alter immune responses in
animals  and  may  influence  sex  differences  in  autoimmune  diseases  as
has been found for viral myocarditis in mice (Bruno et al., 2019; Castro-
Correia et al., 2018; Edwards et al., 2018; Popescu et al., 2021). Compounds
within  this  category  may  exhibit  estrogenic,  antiandrogenic,  or  thyroid

238

hormone  effects,  including  disruption  to  hormone  binding,  synthesis,
secretion, transport and metabolism. There is a growing body of research
pertaining  to  effects  of  specific  compounds  or  classes  of  chemical  com-
pounds on immune function (Nowak et al., 2019), but there has been rela-
tively little focused research to date within the context of autoimmunity
or autoimmune diseases.

Dietary Exposures

As  Chapter  3  described,  autoimmune  diseases  share  several  diet-
related risk factors (Table 4-1), suggesting common etiologies and mecha-
nisms.  Several  of  the  shared  dietary  risk  factors,  including  breast  milk,
gluten,  vitamin  D,  omega-3  fatty  acids,  and  sugars,  play  a  significant
role in shaping the gut microbiome (Hamilton-Williams et al., 2021), and
researchers theorize that these dietary components may interact with the
microbiome  to  stimulate  a  mucosal  immune  response. Alternatively,  or
in addition, dietary intake influences the inflammatory state of the body,
which may also play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases.
Although vitamin D is considered a vitamin, it is actually a steroid hor-
mone  that  binds  to  the  vitamin  D  receptor  with  downstream  transcrip-
tional regulation of many genes (Tintut and Demer, 2021), and similar to
other steroid hormones, vitamin D strongly influences immune responses
(Park and Han, 2021).

Research has also found that proinflammatory dietary factors, such as
red meat and sugar-sweetened beverages, are associated with increased
risk of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 dia-
betes, whereas anti-inflammatory dietary factors, such as omega-3 fatty
acids,  have  been  associated  with  decreased  risk  of  type  1  diabetes  and
rheumatoid arthritis. The recently published Vitamin D and Omega 3 Trial
found that supplementation with vitamin D led to a 22 percent reduction
in all incident autoimmune diseases, and supplementation with marine
omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) with or without vitamin D led to a (nonsig-
nificant) 15 percent reduction in all incident autoimmune diseases during
5 years of randomized follow-up of more than 25,800 older adults from
the general population (Hahn et al., 2022). The study was not adequately
powered to examine the effect of supplementation on individual autoim-
mune  diseases.  The  list  of  shared  dietary  risk  factors  in  Table  4-1  was
limited to those observed in prospective studies. It is likely that additional
prospective  investigations  of  diet  in  other  autoimmune  diseases  would
uncover  more  shared  dietary  risk  factors,  thereby  providing  clues  into
shared  etiologies  and  mechanisms.  Additionally,  systematic  collection
of longitudinal data on dietary exposures would enable examination of
their  role  in  development,  progression,  and  mitigation  of  autoimmune
diseases.

The preceding discussion of environmental factors provides a founda-
tion for considering potential approaches to preventing the occurrence of
autoimmune diseases. Some approaches are based outside of the health
care system such as advertising efforts to discourage smoking or work-
site  interventions  to  reduce  levels  of  respirable  silica  exposure.  Other
approaches  rely  on  health  care  provider  interactions  with  individuals,
including efforts to identify people at high(er) risk for developing autoim-
mune diseases; monitor biomarkers of disease development such as type
1 diabetes-linked antibodies; apply exposure interventions; and use phar-
maceutical agents that research shows can reduce disease risk, as seen in
ongoing studies for type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

Finding: Environmental factors such as infection, occupational expo-
sure  to  respirable  silica,  solvents,  and  diet  have  been  implicated  in
multiple autoimmune diseases, and the same individual environmen-
tal factor may also be associated with multiple autoimmune diseases.
Evidence  suggests  that  genetic  predisposition  may  work  in  concert
with environmental exposures to cause autoimmune disease; more-
over, there is evidence to suggest that both genetic and environmental
exposure  must  be  present  in  order  for  disease  to  develop.  The  role
of  environmental  exposures  in  disease  progression  and  flares  is  an
important area requiring additional research.

Conclusion: Research is needed to define the type and duration of environ­
mental  exposures  associated  with  development  and  progression  of  autoim­
mune diseases, including disease flares, both for specific diseases and across
diseases. Similarly, further research is needed to identify the permutation of
genes  and  environmental  exposures  that  lead  to  autoimmune  diseases.  In
addition, investigations into how dietary antigens and other environmental
exposures interact with the microbiome are needed.

Inflammation, Autoantibodies, and
Mechanisms of Autoimmune Disease

The presence of autoantibodies is a common feature of autoimmune
diseases,  as  is  the  presence  of  inflammatory  cells  such  as  mononuclear
phagocytes, autoreactive T lymphocytes and autoantibody-producing B
cells. Autoantibodies play a key role in disease diagnosis, and they may
be pathogenic in some cases when they bind to self-tissues, activate the
complement  cascade,  and instigate  cell  destruction  and/or  clearing  cell
debris (Burbelo et al., 2021; Daha et al., 2011). They can also interact with
and alter the function of cell-surface receptors, as is the case in myasthenia

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

241

gravis and Graves’ disease (Chain et al., 2020; George et al., 2021; Kojima
et al., 2021).

Immune system cells induced during inflammation can play a major
pathogenic  role  in  many  autoimmune  diseases,  either  by  killing  cells
directly  or  by  releasing  cytotoxic  cytokines,  prostaglandins,  or  reactive
nitrogen or oxygen intermediates. At the same time, other immune system
cells, such as suppressor or regulatory T cells, function as a counterbal-
ance  in  controlling  inflammation  and  autoimmune  responses  by  killing
self-reactive T cells and releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines. Disrupt-
ing the regulation of self-reactive T cells and autoantibody production by
regulatory T cells may result in the development of autoimmunity. Simi-
larly,  breaking  tolerance  against  self-antigens  may  trigger  the  develop-
ment of autoimmune disease (Abbas et al., 2004; Marx et al., 2021; Nelson,
2004).  Self-tolerance  develops  through  carefully  regulated  mechanisms,
and defects in one or more of these mechanisms may lead to autoimmune
disease development.

Inoculating animals with self-antigen in combination with adjuvants
that activate the immune response enables investigators to produce ani-
mal  models  that  recreate  many  of  the  features  of  human  autoimmune
diseases (see Chapter 3 for more information on animal models for spe-
cific  autoimmune  diseases).  Injecting  adjuvants  without  self-antigen  or
self-antigen  without  adjuvants  does  not  usually  result  in  the  develop-
ment of autoimmune disease. Thus, in the context of presentation of self-
antigen that occurs presumably as a result of viral infection or chemical
exposure, it is necessary to activate the innate immune system in order to
develop the adaptive immune response (i.e., a T cell and B cell response)
that  progresses  to  autoimmune  disease.  Adjuvant-stimulated  collagen-
induced  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  cardiac  myosin-induced  myocarditis
are examples of this type of animal model (Fontes et al., 2017). The self-
antigens that are responsible for causing autoimmune disease have been
identified for a number of autoimmune diseases including cardiac myosin
for myocarditis (Myers et al., 2013), myelin basic protein or myelin oligo-
dendrocyte  glycoprotein  for  multiple  sclerosis  (Martinsen  and  Kursula,
2022; Yannakakis et al., 2016), and collagen for rheumatoid arthritis (Allen
et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2019). However, the autoantigens associated with
most autoimmune diseases remain unknown. Identifying new autoanti-
gens is necessary in order to develop new animal models of disease, to
better detect autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells, and to develop new
and more effective therapies.

Increased  production  of  the  proinflammatory  cytokines  TNF  and
IL-1b are also involved in the development of some autoimmune diseases.
Injecting  strains   of   mice   that  are   genetically  susceptible   to   developing
autoimmunity  with   either   of   these   cytokines,   or  with   certain   adjuvants

242

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

(i.e.,  lipopolysaccharide  that  binds  to  TLR4  releasing  IL-1β)  that  stimu-
late their production, can accelerate autoimmune disease. Repeating the
same experiment with genetically resistant mouse strains can break self-
tolerance and lead to autoimmunity (Lane et al., 1992, 1993). This suggests
that environmental factors can overcome genetic resistance to developing
autoimmune disease.

Disease Predictors

A  number  of  biomarkers  obtained  from  serum,  tissues,  or  other
sources  have  been  used  to  predict  the  development  of  an  autoimmune
disease, to confirm diagnosis, or to predict the outcome of disease, such
as autoantibodies, cytokines, microRNAs, and T cell–B cell interactions.

Autoantibodies  are  common  in  autoimmune  diseases,  and,  while
their role in the disease pathogenesis is not  always clear, detecting  them in
clinical specimens  may aid  in diagnosing or, in some cases, predicting dis-
ease. In type 1 diabetes, perhaps the most studied autoimmune disease,
autoantibodies  that target intracellular  autoantigens  prior  to  the  patient
developing autoimmune pathology are  detectable many years  prior  to  the
onset of  clinical  symptoms  (Burbelo  et al.,  2021;  Leslie  et al.,  2001).  The
risk of  developing type  1  diabetes  within  5  years  increases  from  approxi-
mately 10 percent when a blood sample shows one autoantibody to 60 to
80  percent when  it shows  three  autoantibodies  (Notkins,  2004;  Ziegler  et
al.,  2013).  In  SLE,  autoantibodies  can  be  detected  in  blood  samples  taken
years   before   the   clinical   features   of   the   disease  appear   (Arbuckle   et  al.,
2003),   and   researchers   have   proposed   that  detecting  autoantibodies   or
other  measures  of  inflammation  may be  predictors  of  disease  (Lambers  et
al.,  2021).  Similarly,  studies  have  detected  autoantibodies  up to  20  years
before   diagnosis   of   Sjögren’s   disease   (Theander   et  al.,   2015),   and   years
in  advance  of  clinical  manifestations  or  diagnosis  of  other  autoimmune
diseases, including  rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, celiac disease,
thyroid  disease,  and  others  (Burbelo  et al.,  2021;  Leslie  et al.,  2001).

The  ability  to  reliably  predict  the  development  of  autoimmune  dis-
eases is an opportunity to intervene to prevent or delay development of
clinical manifestations of disease and to improve outcomes. New, excit-
ing  data  are  now  available  for  many  autoimmune  diseases,  some  more
advanced than others, and additional studies are needed to better define
the complex components driving risk to developing disease.

In  type  1  diabetes,  research  has  included  focusing  on  genetic  risk
factors, exposures in infancy or before birth, and development of autoan-
tibodies in the first years of life (Anand et al., 2021; Bonifacio et al., 2021;
Frederiksen et al., 2013; Jacobsen et al., 2015; Krischer et al., 2019; Ng et

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

243

al., 2022; Ziegler et al., 2013). Such studies have made predicting disease
development reliable enough to justify preventive intervention in those at
high risk. The Global Platform for the Prevention of Autoimmune Diabe-
tes Primary Oral Insulin Trial is randomizing infants with a > 10 percent
risk for developing multiple autoantibodies, which in turn predicts high
risk for type 1 diabetes, to receive daily oral insulin or placebo. To deter-
mine whether the intervention prevents development of autoantibodies
or   progression  to   diabetes,   investigators   will   follow   the   infants   up  to   7
years   (Ziegler   et  al.,   2019).   Because   the   trial  participants   have   not  yet
developed  evidence  of  autoimmunity but are  at risk for doing so,  it is  a
primary prevention  trial  (Primavera  et al.,  2020).  In a  secondary preven-
tion trial, nondiabetic relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes who
were  at high  risk for development of  disease  (defined  as  having two  or
more  autoantibodies  and  dysglycemia  but not overt diabetes)  were  ran-
domized  to  a  T  cell-targeting therapy or  placebo  and  monitored  for  the
progression   to   clinical   diagnosis   of   diabetes   (Herold   et  al.,   2019).   Treat-
ment delayed  progression to  diagnosis  of  diabetes.  Given that treatment
is  not risk free,  justification  for  its  use  requires  highly reliable  prediction
of  high-risk individuals.

Similar studies, although less advanced, are in progress to define pre-
dictive measures and preemptive interventions for rheumatoid arthritis
(Deane and Holers, 2021). Genetic risk scores and certain autoantibodies
inform  the  predictive  power;  documented  dietary  and  infectious  expo-
sures can enhance prediction and provide targets for intervention (Prima-
vera et al., 2020). In addition, recent data in the study of SLE indicate that
antibody to Ro52 may predict which pre-diagnosis patients will progress
to diagnosable disease (Munoz-Grajales et al., 2021).

Cytokine  profiles  can  also  be  used  as  biomarkers.  For  example,  the
type I, II, and III interferon (IFN) cytokines are involved in SLE (Idborg
and Oke, 2021), and most patients with SLE have an augmented expres-
sion of IFN-regulated genes, termed an “IFN gene signature,” with type
I IFNs contributing most to the signature (Capecchi et al., 2020; Ramas-
wamy et al., 2021). Circulating levels of IFN-α correlate with disease activ-
ity and potentially could be used as a disease biomarker (Idborg and Oke,
2021). However, levels of IFN-γ have been shown to rise years before both
type  I  IFN  activation  and  clinical  presentation  of  SLE.  In  addition,  the
patterns of cytokine increases vary with different clinical manifestations
of SLE. Further research in this area will likely yield novel biomarkers.

Another  potential  biomarker  is  to  use  a  combination  of  cytokines
(soluble  ST2,  IL-6),  immune  cell  responses  (Th17),  and  micro  RNAs  to
diagnose  and/or  predict  worse  outcome  in  myocarditis.  Soluble  ST2  is
a cytokine in the TLR4/IL-1R family that has been found to be elevated
in men and male mice with myocarditis and to be associated with worse

244

outcome   (Coronado  et al.,  2019).  The  cytokines  IL-1β and  IL-6,  necessary
for the development of Th17-type immune responses, have been found to
be elevated in men with myocarditis where Th17 responses were found to
be  associated  with  poor  outcome, but only in  men  (Myers  et al.,  2016).  In
addition,  a  microRNA  associated  with  Th17  cells  was  identified  in viral
and autoimmune animal models of myocarditis that enabled researchers
to distinguish myocarditis from other forms of inflammatory heart disease
(Blanco-Domínguez  et al.,  2021).  These  immune  pathways  (TLR4/IL-1β/
IL-6/Th17)  are  common to  many autoimmune  diseases  and  indicate  the
importance   of   identifying  common  pathogenic   mechanisms   that  may
reveal  new  biomarkers  and  therapeutic  strategies  to  prevent disease.

Many autoimmune diseases involve pathologic T cell–B cell interac-
tions, and more specifically, implicate PD-1hi  CXCR5-T peripheral helper
cells, which suggests that these T helper cells might be used as biomarkers
of disease progression and as a target for therapy (Marks and Rao, 2022).
Biomarkers  also  may  be  used  to  predict  disease-activity  changes  such
as flares of disease, as was recently reported using cytokines to identify
renal and non-renal disease flares in individuals with SLE (Ruchakorn et
al., 2019).

The  most  effective  disease  predictors  will  likely  need  to  be  com-
binations  of  biomarkers  and/or  algorithms  rather  than  an  individual
biomarker.

Finding:  Autoantibodies  and  other  biomarkers  are  associated  with
autoimmune  diseases,  and  the  presence  of  autoantibodies  has  been
detected before, and sometimes long before, clinical disease develops.
An increase in proinflammatory cells, cytokines, and signaling path-
ways has been implicated in the development of autoimmune disease.

Conclusion: Continued research is needed to identify traditional and novel
biomarkers,  such  as  autoantibodies,  cytokines,  and  genetic  risk  factors,  of
autoimmune  disease  in  order  to  predict,  intervene  to  delay  or  modify  out­
comes, and possibly even prevent development of clinical illness.

Sex Differences

Most autoimmune diseases display a sex difference in incidence and
severity  of  disease  (Cooper  and  Stroehla,  2003).  These  differences  may
result  from  the  differential  effects  of  sex  hormones;  microchimerism,
which is the presence of two genetically distinct cell populations in the
same individual; specific genes on the X or Y chromosomes; X chromo-
some  inactivation;  and  sex  differences  in  the  body’s  response  to  envi-
ronmental  factors.  Of  these,  researchers  consider  sex  hormones  to  be  a

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

245

major contributor to the sex differences in autoimmune diseases because
of  their  essential  role  in  the  normal  physiologic  function  of  cells,  tis-
sues, and organs and their well-defined and extensive role in regulating
the  immune  system  in  normal  and  pathological  conditions.  Sex  steroid
hormone  receptors  are  expressed  in  or  on  the  surface  of  immune  cells
(Buskiewicz et al., 2016), and those expressed on the surface in particular
influence the immune response, as they likely contribute to immune sig-
naling by innate and adaptive immune receptors in a sex-specific manner
(Benten et al., 1999a,b; Schlegel et al., 1999).

Estrogen activates B cells, resulting in increased antibody and auto-
antibody responses to infection, vaccines, and autoantigens (Fischinger et
al., 2019). In contrast, androgens such as testosterone and dehydroepian-
drosterone decrease B cell maturation, reduce B cell synthesis of antibody,
and suppress autoantibody production in humans with SLE, for example
(Cook,  2008;  Flanagan  et  al.,  2017;  Gubbels  Bupp  and  Jorgensen,  2018;
Regitz-Zagrosek et al., 2008). Estrogen’s ability to increase autoantibodies
and T and B cell responses, which are adaptive immune system activities,
could  play  a  key  role  in  the  increased  incidence  and  severity  of  many
autoimmune  diseases  that  occur  more  often  in  women  than  men,  such
as autoimmune thyroiditis, Sjögren’s disease, SLE, and systemic sclerosis
(Cooper  and  Stroehla,  2003;  Fairweather  et  al.,  2012),  while  androgen’s
ability to increase Toll-like receptors, mast cells, and macrophages, which
are innate immune system activities, may drive autoimmune diseases in
men (Fairweather et al., 2008; Gubbels Bupp and Jorgensen, 2018). How-
ever, while there is evidence that estrogen influences immune signaling
pathways pivotal in autoimmune disease and that it affects antibody and
autoantibody  levels  in  autoimmune  disease  in  different  animal  and  tis-
sue culture models with normal and diseased cells, the fact that estrogen
levels rise substantially during pregnancy and that autoimmune disease
activity does not increase during pregnancy, and in some diseases such
as rheumatoid arthritis, decreases during pregnancy, suggests that more
research is needed to understand the role of estrogen in autoimmune dis-
ease (Moulton, 2018). Additionally, other hormones that alter the immune
response besides estrogen are released during pregnancy such as proges-
terone (Desai and Brinton, 2019; Piccinni et al., 2021; Ziegler et al., 2018),
making it more complicated to understand the role of a specific hormones
in the progression of autoimmune disease.

Environmental exposures can affect sex hormone activity. For exam-
ple,  endocrine  disruptors  such  as  BPA  have  been  shown  to  alter  sex
hormone  expression  and  ratio  on/in  immune  and  other  cell  types  in  a
sex-specific  manner  (Böckers  et  al.,  2020;  Bruno  et  al.,  2019),  and  there
have  been  few  studies  on  the  role  of  endocrine-disrupting  chemicals  in
autoimmune diseases (Bruno et al., 2019).

246

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Sex hormones are not the only factors driving sex differences in auto-
immune diseases. Other factors besides estrogen that could increase auto-
immune disease in women include genes expressed on X chromosomes,
as appears to be the case in SLE, for example (Umiker et al., 2014), and
differential  responses  to  stress,  especially  early  in  childhood  (Dube  et
al., 2009). The global effect of sex hormones on immune cell phenotype
and function that promotes systemic or organ-specific autoimmunity is a
common mechanism that occurs among different autoimmune diseases in
adults. The role of onset of autoimmunity prior to puberty also requires
study.

Finding: Sex chromosomes, sex hormones, and the effects of environ-
mental exposures on sex hormones appear to play a role in differences
between  males  and  females  in  the  occurrence  and  pathogenesis  of
autoimmune disease.

Conclusion:  Additional  research  is  needed  to  illuminate  the  role  of  sex
chromosomes, sex hormones, and the effect of environmental exposures on
sex hormones in the development of autoimmune disease as this could inform
diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases.

Complications, Comorbidities, and Co-occurring
or Overlapping Autoimmune Diseases

People  with  autoimmune  diseases  commonly  have  complications,
which are “sequelae or predictable consequences of a particular diagno-
sis”  (Iezzoni,  2013);  complications  are  considered  a  direct  result  of  the
autoimmune disease or its treatment and increase the risk of developing
another health problem. Examples of complications that adversely affect
prognosis and treatment are cardiovascular disease in patients with diabe-
tes and colon cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis. Patients with auto-
immune diseases may also suffer comorbidities, which “are diseases with
unrelated etiology” (Iezzoni, 2013) that do not share causes, symptoms,
or laboratory abnormalities with the autoimmune disease. A patient may
also develop a co-occurring autoimmune disease, which is one that does
not share symptoms or laboratory test results with the coexisting autoim-
mune disease. And finally, patients with autoimmune disease may suffer
from  an  overlapping  autoimmune  disease,  defined  as  the  simultaneous
presence of clinical and laboratory features of multiple autoimmune dis-
eases—for example, SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, commonly known as
“rhupus” (Antonini et al., 2020).

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

247

Complications of Autoimmune Diseases

Complications   of   autoimmune   diseases   (Table   4-2)   can  be   serious.
Depression and anxiety are examples of complications that occur across
a  majority of  autoimmune  disorders.  The occurrence  of  depression and/
or  anxiety in  the  broad  range  of  autoimmune  conditions  may result from
the   psychological   effects   or   from   the   social  determinants   of   living  with
an  autoimmune  disorder  (Martz  et al.,  2021),  but research  has  not ruled
out the  possibility that the  direct central  nervous  system  effects  of  rheu-
matoid  arthritis,  SLE,  and  multiple  sclerosis  may play a  role  in  inducing
depression   (Bai   et  al.,   2016;   Vallerand   et  al.,   2018,   2019).   Cardiovascu-
lar disorders, stroke, lymphoma, and renal failure complicate a number
of   autoimmune   disorders.   Sometimes   complications   are   specific   to   the
organ   targeted   by  the   autoimmune   disorder.   Hepatocellular   carcinoma
and  portal  hypertension,  for  example,  result from  cirrhosis,  which occurs
as  a  consequence  of  primary biliary cholangitis.  It is  critical  for  clinicians
to  be  aware  of  the  complications  of  the  diagnosed  autoimmune  disease,
to  undertake  appropriate  screening  for   them,  and  to  engage   patients  in
self-management so that patients are knowledgeable about potential com-
plications  and  successful  preventive  strategies,  and  thus  will  bring their
symptoms  to  medical  attention  (Bodenheimer  et al.,  2002).

Co-occurring and Overlapping Autoimmune Disease

Table 4-3 shows the likelihood of increased risk for co-occurrence of
a second autoimmune illness for the autoimmune diseases examined in
Chapter 3. There is one exception: risk is decreased for co-occurring mul-
tiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis (Somers et al., 2009). Study of the
patterns of co-occurrence may inform knowledge of pathophysiology and
mechanistic  pathways  for  all  autoimmune  illnesses.  For  instance,  both
genetic  susceptibility  and  environmental  agents,  including  diet,  likely
play  a  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  autoimmune  diseases,  but  how  they
affect  clinical  phenotype  is  unknown. As  with  complications,  it  is  criti-
cal for clinicians and patients to be aware of the symptoms of a second
autoimmune disease when the patient has a diagnosed autoimmune dis-
ease  that  has  a  higher  association  with  one  or  more  other  autoimmune
diseases.

Finding:  Co-occurring  and  overlapping  autoimmune  diseases  are
common;  patients  in  these  subsets  differ  from  those  with  a  single
autoimmune disease.

Conclusion: Greater focus on patients with co-occurring and overlapping
autoimmune  diseases  may  provide  insight  into  the  pathophysiology  and
mechanistic pathways of autoimmune disease, better characterize this type
of illness, and lead to better patient care.

Common Mechanistic Pathways as Therapeutic Targets

Despite  the  considerable  variation  in  clinical  symptoms  or  targeted
organs  among  the  different  autoimmune  diseases,  the  specific  mecha-
nisms  of  immune-mediated  damage  that  leads  to  the  different  clinical
pictures  may  share  common  immune  pathways.  As  discussed  above,
cytokines  are  key  mediators  of  immune  cell  effector  functions,  either
in  stimulating  other  immune  cells  to  propagate  disease  or  in  directly
affecting target organ cells to cause damage. The identification of specific
proinflammatory  signaling  pathways  and  their  cytokines  as  pathogenic
in  autoimmune  diseases  has  resulted  in  targeted  therapeutics  that  aim
to  block  their  effects.  Identifying  TNF  as  an  inflammatory  cytokine  in
synovial fluid from individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and then dem-
onstrating  that  blocking  TNF  ameliorated  disease  in  a  mouse  model  of
inflammatory arthritis led to the study of TNF inhibitors in the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis (Feldmann and Maini, 2010). The Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has approved TNF inhibitors for treating a num-
ber  of  different  autoimmune  diseases  in  adults  and  children  including
rheumatoid  arthritis,  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis,  plaque  psoriasis  and
psoriatic  arthritis,  ankylosing  spondylitis,  inflammatory  bowel  disease
(Crohn’s  disease  and  ulcerative  colitis),  and  uveitis  (FDA,  2021).  While
TNF inhibitors have had a significant effect on the management of these
autoimmune  diseases  for  many  individuals,  they  are  not  effective  for
everyone.  Studies  of  those  individuals  who  fail  to  respond  adequately
to currently available medications may help to elucidate additional cyto-
kines or other immune pathways that can be targeted therapeutically.

As  noted  above,  IL-1  is  another  cytokine  that  plays  a  pathogenic
role  in  the  inflammation  associated  with  some  autoimmune  diseases.
Clinical  studies  have  shown  that  IL-1  inhibitors  are  effective  and  often
life-saving in dampening the hyperinflammatory response in autoinflam-
matory diseases such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, monogenic
autoinflammatory  diseases  such  as  cryopyrin-associated  periodic  syn-
dromes,  and  cytokine  storm  syndromes  including  the  hyperinflamma-
tory response that may occur in children following SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Jesus  and  Goldbach-Mansky,  2014;  Malcova  et  al.,  2021;  Mehta  et  al.,
2020; Tanner and Wahezi, 2020).

Type  I  interferons,  a  family  of  molecules  that  includes  17  different
cytokines, have relevant roles in autoimmune diseases, as well as a key

252

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

role in anti-viral immune responses (Lazear et al., 2019). This latter role,
along with the association of type I interferons with autoimmune diseases,
may support the idea that viral infections participate in triggering autoim-
munity. However, research has also suggested that dysregulation of the
type  I  interferon  system  or  stimulation  of  type  I  interferon  production
by  endogenous  triggers  may  be  involved  in  the  etiology  of  autoimmu-
nity. One extreme example of the latter is the class of autoinflammatory
diseases  grouped  as  interferonopathies,  which  result  from  monogenic
inborn errors of immunity that lead to upregulation of a type I interferon
response (Sogkas et al., 2021).

Research has implicated type I interferons as playing a role in sev-
eral  non-monogenic  autoimmune  diseases  based  on  measurements  of
interferons directly or, more commonly, with the detection of the inter-
feron  signature—a  collection  of  genes  that  are  upregulated  in  response
to interferons. SLE is the prototypical type I interferon-associated autoim-
mune disease, but studies have also associated type I interferons with dis-
eases such as Sjögren’s disease, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and
systemic sclerosis (Jiang et al., 2020). Many of the disease risk-associated
gene  variants  shared  among  autoimmune  diseases  are  also  associated
with  type  I  interferon-mediated  signaling  pathways  (Figure  4-1). Addi-
tional support for a pathogenic role for type I interferons came from the
development  of  autoimmune  manifestations  following  treatment  with
type I interferons for cancer or viral hepatitis infections. These manifesta-
tions included effects on immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, vasculitis,
autoimmune thyroid disease, autoimmune hepatitis, Raynaud phenom-
enon, rheumatoid arthritis, myositis, psoriasis, interstitial nephritis, auto-
immune colitis, and SLE, and product inserts for type I interferon drugs
noted them as potential adverse effects of treatment (FDA, 2021). Other
autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, may actually improve
with type I interferon treatment, suggesting that the role of type I inter-
ferons in driving autoimmunity is not absolute (FDA, 2021).

The  pathogenic  role  of  type  I  interferons  in  multiple  autoimmune
diseases  or  monogenetic  autoinflammatory  diseases  has  led  to  devel-
oping  treatments  to  target  the  type  I  interferon  pathway;  these  include
blocking  type  I  interferons  or  the  type  I  interferon  receptor  directly,  or
through small molecule inhibitors such as the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibi-
tors that target key signaling components of the type I interferon signaling
pathway. FDA has approved JAK inhibitors for the treatment of multiple
autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic
arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis (Harrington et al., 2020;
O’Shea, 2021; Troncone et al., 2020), and clinical trials are ongoing in other
autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, Sjögren’s disease, SLE,
idiopathic  inflammatory  myopathies,  alopecia  areata,  vitiligo,  psoriasis,

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

253

Crohn’s  disease,  spondyloarthritis/ankylosing  spondylitis,  and  vasculi-
tis (NIH, 2021). The JAK family comprises four different kinases (JAK1,
JAK2, JAK3, tyrosine kinase 2) that may each be blocked somewhat selec-
tively by different drugs. Different JAKs or combinations of JAKs are used
by  different  cytokine  receptors  to  mediate  signaling,  so  JAK  inhibitors
may be used to block signaling through multiple different inflammatory
cytokine receptors as appropriate for specific diseases. Additional drugs
specifically  targeting  other  inflammatory  cytokines,  including  but  not
limited to IFN-g, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-12/23 shared subunit, are in use or
in development for treating multiple different autoimmune diseases that
share these specific inflammatory cytokines in the disease process (Baker
and Isaacs, 2018).

Further  studies  to  identify  common  immune  pathways  in  different
autoimmune  diseases  or  subsets  of  different  diseases  will  continue  to
provide  insight  into  potentially  targetable  molecules  that  could  lead  to
treatments for multiple different autoimmune diseases.

Finding: Specific mechanisms of immune-mediated damage that lead
to the different clinical phenotypes share common immune pathways.
Identifying  specific  proinflammatory  signaling  pathways  and  their
cytokines as pathogenic in autoimmune diseases has yielded targeted
therapeutics that aim to block their effects, as with, for example, TNF
inhibitors and IL-1 inhibitors.

Conclusion:  Continued  research  is  needed  to  identify  additional  immune
pathways that promote or inhibit autoimmune disease. Such pathways may
be common to multiple autoimmune diseases and inform drug development.

Animal Models

Animal models have played a critical role in defining common genetic
and  environmentally-induced  mechanisms  that  drive  the  pathogenesis
of autoimmune diseases as described in this chapter. Chapter 3 describes
some  of  these  animal  models  for  the  autoimmune  diseases  that  are  the
focus of this report, but a detailed description of the many animal models
investigators are using and the key findings and discoveries that studies
using these models have produced is outside the scope of this report.

Existing  animal  models  form  a  critical  component  of  autoimmune
disease research by providing mechanistic understanding of autoimmune
diseases and preclinical data needed for translational research. For exam-
ple, environmental causes of several human autoimmune diseases includ-
ing celiac disease (Wu et al., 2021), rheumatic fever (de Loizaga and Bea-
ton, 2021), and myocarditis (Boehmer et al., 2021) are known, and these

254

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

diseases could be used as models to accelerate identification of triggers
and  primary  prevention  for  others.  The  ability  to  directly  study  effects
of genetic modification, environmental effects, or potentially therapeutic
immunomodulatory agents on the function of the immune system or the
development of autoimmunity has been invaluable. Moreover, the abil-
ity to study immune cells and non-immune cells harvested directly from
the  target organs  may provide  a  basis  for  subsequent studies  in  human
tissues,  which  are  often  much  less  readily  available   or  accessible.   The
committee  wants  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  existing animal  models
that continue  to  provide  valuable  understanding of  disease  pathogenesis
as  well  as  the  need  to  develop  animal  models  for  many  autoimmune
diseases  where  animal  models  do  not  currently  exist  and  the  need  to
continue   to   develop  new   animal   models   that  answer   specific   and   more
translational  research questions.

Future advances in tissue culture, such as 3D organoids, or organs-on-
a-chip, which can model organs and systems such as the immune system
(Park  et  al.,  2020;  Polini  et  al.,  2019),  as  well  as  novel  culture,  animal,
and other models, such as in silico confirmatory trials that use computer
simulation to model virtual cohorts of patients (Pappalardo et al., 2019),
may provide additional insight into autoimmune disease mechanisms or
effective therapies.

Finding: Existing animal models are invaluable for studying mecha-
nisms of autoimmune disease pathogenesis and providing preclinical
data for translational research.

Conclusion: Developing animal models for autoimmune diseases that cur­
rently have no models or are rare diseases and continuing to develop animal
models that can better answer mechanistic questions posed by translational
research would be of value. Technological innovation for the creation of new
models for autoimmune disease research is needed.

MAXIMIZING ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY

Over the past decade, the availability of innovative technologies has
completely  changed  the  research  environment  and  has  come  to  domi-
nate  research  on  autoimmune  diseases.  These  technological  advances
and  the  knowledge  they  have  generated  include  the  ability  to  perform
more complex analyses of biological systems; knowledge about genomics
and epigenomics; cytokine profiling; microbiomics, proteomics, metabolo-
mics, and the study of changes in these “omics”; and generation of artifi-
cial intelligence. Fine-mapping genetic and epigenetic causal autoimmune
disease  variants,  for  example,  enables  researchers  to  identify  clustering

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

255

among autoimmune diseases (Farh et al., 2015). As an example, a genetic
region containing the gene for the enzyme tyrosine kinase 2 was identi-
fied in genome-wide association studies as linked to many autoimmune
diseases, including psoriasis, SLE, and Crohn’s disease (Makin, 2021). A
disease-associated gene variant modifies the enzyme, which plays a role
in cytokine function. Therapy to block enzyme function greatly reduced
skin lesions in psoriasis, and a phase III trial in psoriasis and early-stage
trials in Crohn’s disease, SLE, and psoriatic arthritis are under way.

The ability to study gene expression profiles in immune cells at the
single-cell level provides insights into the complex processes within het-
erogeneous  tissue  samples  (Yofe  et  al.,  2020).  Moreover,  combining  the
transcriptomics with proteomics on a single cell level (such as with flow
or mass cytometry) can provide tremendous detail of complex subsets of
immune  and  non-immune  cells  contributing  to  the  inflammatory  state
within affected tissue. Analyses of synovial fluid from individuals with
rheumatoid arthritis compared with non-autoimmune arthritis (osteoar-
thritis) combined single-cell RNA sequencing with mass cytometry and
identified  18  unique  cell  populations—including  different  subsets  of  T
cells,  B  cells,  monocytes,  and  fibroblasts—and  discovered  the  specific
subsets expressing genes for key inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (expressed
by  fibroblasts)  and  IL-1b  (expressed  by  pro-inflammatory  monocytes)
(Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Another  study  utilizing  mass  cytometry  coupled
analyses  from  labial  minor  salivary  gland  biopsy  samples  with  blood
samples from individuals with Sjögren’s disease to define immunopheno-
types of cells from the affected organs and the peripheral blood (Mingue-
neau et al., 2016). The study identified different disease clusters based on
profiles of cells within the affected tissue and peripheral blood including
associations  with  disease  activity  parameters  and  potential  pathogenic
cells to be targeted therapeutically. In another study, single cell sequenc-
ing to define T-cell receptor gene expression to identify clones of T cells
expanded  within  affected  tissue  samples  of  individuals  with  Sjögren’s
disease identified common T-cell receptor sequences within and between
individual samples, strongly suggesting common antigen-driven immune
response between different individuals (Joachims et al., 2016). The techno-
logic advances afforded by single cell RNA sequencing provides a level of
detail not possible through other measures to identify specific clonotypes
of T cells in the absence of known antigens even from small samples such
as cells isolated from biopsy specimens routinely obtained for diagnostic
purposes. The analyses of such complex data sets are continually evolv-
ing, with recent study demonstrating the utility of latent factor modeling
of  single  cell  RNA  sequencing  data  to  define  new  pathways  active  in
synovial tissues of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and in the kid-
neys of individuals with SLE (Palla and Ferrero, 2020). Additional single

256

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

cell RNA sequencing studies have been performed in rheumatoid arthri-
tis, SLE, systemic sclerosis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis, Sjögren’s
disease, Kawasaki disease, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes (Kuret
et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021). A possible avenue is to use high-throughput
screening of thousands of autoantigens in parallel rather than single auto-
antigens or panels of single autoantigens. The continued development of
new technologies and complex data-analysis methodologies will continue
to gain unprecedented detailed knowledge of the immunopathologic pro-
cesses in autoimmune diseases.

Gene-editing  techniques  are  available  to  study  the  effects  of  inser-
tion/deletion/alteration of genes of interest on immune cell function and
disease models (Pavlovic et al., 2020). On a public health level, the use of
these  omics  are  being  incorporated  into  defining  the  exposome,  which
will  describe  the  effects  of  lifetime  environmental  exposures  on  health
and disease (DeBord et al., 2016; Manrai et al., 2017).

Given the complexities of autoimmunity on multiple levels, research-
ers are using multi-omics approaches to provide a more comprehensive
understanding of the immune response and the interplay between differ-
ent  components  (cells,  cytokines,  genes,  metabolism)  (Chu  et  al.,  2021).
Such multi-omics approaches have demonstrated that distinct molecular
clusters  characterize  individual  systemic  autoimmune  diseases  despite
common clinical manifestations and that such clusters are similar across
different systemic autoimmune diseases despite differences in clinical pre-
sentation (Barturen et al., 2021). These advanced technologies are generat-
ing  datasets  of  increasing  size  and  complexity,  requiring  more  complex
analyses  that  include  systems  modeling  and  machine  learning,  which
have  also  advanced  during  this  period  and  are  providing  additional
insight into the complexities of autoimmune diseases (Brown et al., 2018).
Artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  machine  learning,  for  example,  can
be used to search electronic health records. An examination of electronic
health records of 167,109 patients with rheumatoid arthritis found that the
risk for lower-tract gastrointestinal perforation associated with treatment
with tocilizumab and tofacitinib to be more than twice that of anti-TNF
(Xie et al., 2016). These tools can be used for precision medicine, a term
that encompasses determining disease treatment for individuals; prospec-
tive  public  health  approaches  that  target  disease  prevention;  and  preci-
sion public health approaches to classify patients into at-risk or disease
subsets for interventions (Conrad et al., 2020). In addition, phenome-wide
association studies match genetic variants to corresponding phenotypes
in electronic health records to gain insight into outcomes and disease risk.
Regardless of the kind of data examined or the investigative purpose,
the  value  of  output  depends  on  the  rigor  of  the  analytic  methods  used

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

257

to collect and interpret it. Big data analytics involves “integration of het-
erogeneous data, data quality control, analysis, modeling, interpretation
and validation” (Ristevski and Chen, 2018), and the skill sets needed to
fulfill these needs are essential to robust research. In addition, sound use
of big data includes planning for optimum usability; in the case of elec-
tronic health records, for example, this would mean to share, clean, and
archive data.

A  multidisciplinary  approach  to  longitudinal  data  collection  in
diverse population-based cohorts is needed in order to provide a strong
foundation for integrated basic, translational, and clinical research neces-
sary to address the complex and challenging questions relating to devel-
opment, progression, and treatment of autoimmune diseases. Immunol-
ogy,  genetics,  and  clinical  expertise  in  a  variety  of  specialties  including
environmental  health,  epidemiology,  and  data  science  are  among  the
disciplines needed to optimize the design, conduct, and analysis of this
research.  Existing  and  newly  developed  large  data  sets  should  apply
rapid improvements in big data-analysis tools, including AI and machine
learning,  to  advance  knowledge  in  autoimmune  diseases.  For  example,
technical advances should be harnessed to increase information on sub-
populations. Technologic tools could be used, among other things, to:



examine genetic variation via genome-wide association studies;
examine  health  disparities  including  the  molecular  underpin-
nings of differences in disease across race and ethnicity and how
these might impact treatment;
study  environmental  triggers  for  disease  onset,  disease  flares,
disease progression, and poor outcomes;
elucidate immunophenotype immune cell pathways;
identify metabolic pathways;

	 decipher within and across disease-homogenous subsets; and

compare persons with minimal disease or disease that has not yet
manifested  with  those  with  severe  disease  or  poor  outcomes  in
order to expose key pathways to target in autoimmunity.

New and evolving technologies are supporting and advancing basic
science,  and  translational  research,  to  which  the  National  Center  for
Advancing Translational Sciences is dedicated, is developing and using
innovative technologies and methodologies to better search and interpret
basic  science  findings  in  order  to  identify  opportunities  for  enhancing
diagnostics and therapeutics. The accruing knowledge will guide clinical
research,  from  informing  the  types  of  samples  collected  and  tests  per-
formed in observational studies to the design of intervention trials.

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Finding: Advances in technology are rapidly providing novel insights
into  disease  pathogenesis  including  autoimmune  diseases.  Multi-
omics  approaches  are  providing  unique  information  about  genetic
and immune profiles that contribute to individual autoimmune dis-
eases as well as revealing common pathogenic mechanisms between
autoimmune diseases.

Conclusion:  Continued  development  of  innovative  technologies  will  be
important  in  providing  breakthroughs  in  understanding  mechanisms  of
autoimmune disease and may reveal new biomarkers that predict, diagnose,
or prevent disease.

SUMMARY AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS

Characteristics  that distinguish autoimmune diseases from  each other
and  those  that  are  common  across  autoimmune  diseases  provide  valu-
able  information  about  the  pathogenesis  of  disease.  These  similarities
and  differences  provide  insights  to  better  understand  the  epidemiology
of  disease,  early predictors/biomarkers  of  disease,  diagnosis,  whether  a
disease  is  predicted  to  primarily affect an  organ or  have  a  systemic  distri-
bution,  the  occurrence  of  a  flare,  and  the  type  of  immune  response  that is
important in driving disease,  for  example.  The  descriptions  of  common
features  across  autoimmune  diseases  that  this  chapter  provides  lead  to
several  research  opportunities.

One  implication  of  considering  autoimmune  diseases  according
to  commonalities  is  that  considering  autoimmune  diseases  as  a  group
according to common mechanisms of disease might provide novel insights
beyond those gained by the more common approach that focuses on the
affected organ or system. Examples of mechanistic themes that are com-
mon across autoimmune diseases that this chapter discusses include sex
differences in incidence, severity, and type of immune response and the
role of type I interferons in increasing autoimmune pathology (Barrat et
al., 2019; Psarras et al., 2017). The current tendency of many researchers
to  focus  on  the  organ  or  system  may  stem  from  the  National  Institutes
of Health’s (NIH’s) organization of study sections based on that scheme.
Animal models that better represent the clinical pathology and course of
disease  would  enable  studies  that  explore  these  common  mechanisms.
As a personalized medicine approach to health care (i.e., genomics/phar-
macogenomics)  becomes  more  common  in  medical  practice,  it  becomes
increasingly  important  to  understand  common  mechanisms  of  autoim-
mune disease given that autoimmune disease may influence other coex-
isting  inflammatory  illnesses  that  are  increasingly  being  considered  as
autoinflammatory  diseases,  including  cardiovascular  diseases  such  as

CROSSCUTTING ISSUES IN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

259

atherosclerosis. In addition, it is common for a patient with one autoim-
mune disease to have another autoimmune disease.

Many  of  the  genes  that  confer  susceptibility  to  autoimmune  dis-
ease and that different autoimmune diseases share regulate the immune
response,  and  some  autoimmune  diseases  with  very  different  clinical
characteristics share genetic variants (Sogkas et al., 2021) (see Figure 4-1
and Figure 4-2). Fine-mapping genetic and epigenetic causal autoimmune
disease variants can detect clustering among autoimmune diseases (Farh
et  al.,  2015).  Studying  the  function  of  genetic  variant-related  immune
pathways will be critical to revealing the genotype–phenotype relation-
ships  that  could  provide  targets  for  therapies.  Polygenic  risk  scores  are
useful, but still have limitations, one being that the genomics data they
are based on would likely need to include more diverse populations in
order to be more broadly relevant.

The number and type of autoantibodies predict progression to auto-
immune disease, but research is lacking in this area across autoimmune
diseases.  Insight  can  be  gained  by  better  characterizing  autoantibodies
that  exist  in  many  autoimmune  diseases  as  well  as  those  that  are  dis-
tinct for a particular disease and using those similarities and differences
to  better  diagnose  disease,  predict  the  risk  of  developing  an  autoim-
mune disease, and predict the progression of disease. Cytokine profiles
and microRNAs, for example, have demonstrated similar opportunities
(Blanco-Domínguez et al., 2021; Idborg and Oke, 2021), and research on
these and other novel biomarkers is called for.

For  some  autoimmune  diseases,  Black,  Hispanic,  and   Indigenous
people  have  an increased  risk and  greater  severity of  disease  (Izmirly et
al.,  2021),  while  for  other  diseases,  the  highest risk occurs  among White
populations (Dabelea et al., 2014). Research pertaining to racial and ethnic
patterns needs to fully address the spectrum of experiences represented
by  these   findings,  including  living  and   work  environments,   social   and
economic  factors,  and  a  wide  variety  of  stressors.  To  date,  few  studies
focusing on  race  and  ethnicity have  used  this  lens.

Although sex differences in autoimmune diseases have been known
and studied for some time, large gaps in defining sex and age differences
and  similarities  remain.  The  field  would  benefit  from  research  on  sex
differences  in  epidemiology,  risk-factor  identification  and  assessment,
diagnostic  criteria,  coexisting  illnesses,  outcomes,  and  other  topics.  The
committee  emphasizes  that  sex  differences  need  to  be  examined  within
the context of age because of the significant changes in sex hormone lev-
els that occur across the lifespan in females and males. There is a gap in
research across the lifespan for most autoimmune diseases.

An  understanding  of  potential  environmental  causes  of  autoim-
mune diseases that is based on a systematic study of exposures including

260

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

dietary factors over time is needed to devise effective approaches to pre-
vent and/or treat disease, including disease flares. Gene and environment
interactions  are  also  understudied.  Twin  concordance  studies  indicate
the   importance   of   both  factors   in  contributing  to   autoimmune   disease
(Brix et al.,  2001;  Nistico  et al.,  2012;  Ulff-Møller  et al.,  2018;  Willer  et al.,
2003)  research to  better  understand  this  relationship is  needed.  Current
research  indicates  that  environmental  factors  drive  disease  in  individu-
als   with  genetic   susceptibility  (Bjornevik  et  al.,   2022;   Mehri   et  al.,   2020;
Robles-Matos  et al.,  2021;  Vestergaard,  2002),  yet the mechanisms  behind
the  relationship  remain  unclear.  It  will  be  important  to  establish  study
sections  that support research  that examines  interactions  between  genes
and  multiple  environmental  factors  such  as  infections  and  chemicals.
Currently  an   unintentional   and   artificial   barrier   exists,   with  grants   for
environmental   topics   going  to   the   National  Institute   of   Environmental
Health   Sciences,   for  example,   and   grants   for  infectious   diseases   going
to  the  National  Institute  of  Allergy and  Infectious  Diseases.  This  type of
research   may  be   important  for   efforts   to   develop  effective   intervention
strategies  to  prevent development of  disease  in  people  who  are  at higher
risk for  developing disease.

Based on the known sex differences in disease for most autoimmune
diseases and the well-described effect of sex hormones on immune cells
and antibodies (Cook, 2008; Fischinger et al., 2019; Flanagan et al., 2017;
Gubbels Bupp and Jorgensen, 2018; Regitz-Zagrosek et al., 2008), an area
that lacks clinical and basic research studies includes the effect of exog-
enous hormone endocrine disruptors such as BPA and bisphenol S, which
replaced  BPA in  plastic  drinking  bottles,  on  autoimmune  disease.  Also
needed are studies on other hormone influencing factors such as those in
diet—soy, for example—and medications such as birth control pills.

That research has  linked  several different infectious  agents  and  chem-
icals  to  one  autoimmune  disease  and  one  infectious  agent to  several dif-
ferent  diseases   suggests   that  common   innate   immune   mechanisms   are
critical  in driving disease.  More  research is  needed  to  better  characterize
these common pathways across multiple autoimmune diseases clinically
and   through   basic   research.  A   better   understanding  of   the   mechanisms
that occur commonly in many autoimmune diseases could fundamentally
improve understanding of  the  pathogenesis  of  autoimmune  disease  and
benefit patients  with  these  conditions.  Current technologies  and  method-
ologies  such as  multi-omics  approaches,  have already contributed  greatly
to this end, and continued development of innovative tools can support
and  drive  further  advances.

NIH Autoimmune Disease Research Efforts

NIH OVERVIEW AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

Analyzing  autoimmune  disease  research  efforts  at  the  National
Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  begins  with  an  understanding  of  the  fund-
ing, administrative structure, and authorities of NIH and its constituent
parts. For more than 130 years, NIH has been the federal agency primarily
responsible  for  sponsoring  and  conducting  basic,  clinical,  and  transla-
tional research (CRS, 2021); research training; and health information and
dissemination in the United States. The agency is one of the 11 operating
divisions in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).1
The stated mission of NIH is to “seek fundamental knowledge about the
nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowl-
edge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability”
(NIH, 2017a). From its origin as the single-room Laboratory of Hygiene in
1887, the agency now executes its missions and goals through the Office
of the Director (OD) and 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) that focus on dif-
ferent areas of biomedical research (CRS, 2019). Appendix E includes the
full list of the ICs and their missions.

1 The other 11 operating divisions are: Administration for Children and Families, Adminis-
tration for Community Living, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Agency for Tox-
ic Substances and Disease Registry, Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Food
and  Drug  Administration,  Health  Resources  and  Services  Administration,  Indian  Health
Service, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (see HHS, 2022).

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

The OD sets policy and coordinates the programs and activities of all
NIH components. Legislation in 2006 and 2016 resulted in a number of
changes at NIH (CRS, 2019). The NIH Reform Act of 2006,2 which imple-
mented many recommendations from a National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine report that reviewed the structure and organi-
zation of NIH, strengthened the OD to perform strategic planning, created
a standardized reporting system, and provided funding (Common Fund)
for  NIH-wide  initiatives  (CRS,  2019;  NRC,  2003).  The Act  also  required
an integrated biennial report of NIH research activities. In response to the
Act, the OD established the Division of Program Coordination, Planning,
and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI) in 2006 (DPCPSI, 2021). DPCPSI over-
sees a number of program Offices that  coordinate research activities on
specific topics that previously reported to the Director of NIH (DPCPSI,
2021).  DPCPSI  identifies  and  assists  NIH  in  responding  to  emerging
scientific  opportunities,  develops  resources  for  the  support  of  portfolio
analyses and priority setting, and supports strategic planning, progress
monitoring, evaluation, and reporting (CRS, 2019; DPCPSI, 2021).

More recently, the 21st Century Cures Act3 directed the NIH Direc-
tor to develop an NIH-wide strategic plan to expedite IC collaboration,
provide guidance on investments made by NIH, and “leverage scientific
opportunity, and advance biomedicine.” The first NIH-wide strategic plan
covered fiscal year (FY) 2016 to 2020, and the most recent plan covers FY
2021 to 2025 (NIH, 2021d).4 The Act also changed guidance on reporting
on NIH research activities from the earlier mandated biennial report to a
triennial report, the most recent of which covered FY 2016 to 2018.5

Congress  annually  appropriates  funds  for  NIH  overall  and  the  ICs
specifically, and sometimes Congress qualifies funds with specific require-
ments or instructions (NIH, 2021e). For example, Congress has required
NIH to establish research programs, provided funding for research on spe-
cific topics, and mandated that NIH create research centers or institutes.
Today,  NIH  is  the  primary  source  of  public  funding  for  biomedical
research in the United States with an annual discretionary budget author-
ity  of  $40.3  billion6  for  FY  2020  (NIH,  2020a;  Viergever  and  Hendriks,
2016). Among  federal  agencies,  NIH  had  the  highest  amount  of  discre-
tionary funds in FY 2020 (Figure 5-1). Table 5-1 provides the trend in NIH
appropriations from FY 2008 to 2020.

Funding for NIH Institutes and Centers

NIH funding goes primarily to the ICs to support research conducted
through  both  extramural  grants  and  intramural  research  projects  (NIH,
2020a).  Extramural  grants  account  for  greater  than  80  percent  of  NIH’s
funding, while intramural support accounts for about 11 percent of NIH
funding (NIH, 2020a, 2021d, 2021e). In 2020, NIH awarded approximately
50,000  competitive  grants  to  approximately  300,000  researchers  (NIH,
2020a, 2021e).

NIH ICs have different missions that guide their activities, and may
focus, for example, on a specific disease, organ system, life stage, field of
science, or training or technology. The ICs also include the NIH Clinical
Center,  the  National  Library  of  Medicine,  and  the  Center  for  Scientific
Review (CSR).

ICs  plan  and  manage  their  own  research  programs  in  coordination
with  the  OD  (NIH,  2021a,  2021e).  ICs  engage  in  strategic  planning  to
set  priorities  and  plan  activities  (NIH,  2015,  2021e).  Figure  5-2  presents
FY  2020  congressional  appropriations  for  the  ICs  and  OD.  The  varia-
tion  in  the  level  of  appropriation  is  notable,  with  the  National  Cancer
Institute (NCI) receiving the largest amount of funding and the Fogarty
International Center receiving the smallest. The level of IC appropriation

correlates with the level of research, training, and other activities that the
ICs that engage in these activities can support.

NIH RESEARCH PROCESS

Extramural Research Funding

At NIH, 24 of the 27 ICs fund the extramural research program (NIH
Central  Resource  for  Grants  and  Funding  Information,  2020),  which
supports  research  across  the  United  States  and  beyond  (NIH,  2021d).
Extramural research can be categorized generally as “unsolicited” inves-
tigator-initiated  research  or  “solicited”  targeted  research  (NIH  Office
of Extramural Research, 2021). Most applications submitted to NIH for
research or research training, including fellowships, are investigator ini-
tiated (NIH Office of Extramural Research, 2021). Investigator-initiated
opportunities may be attractive to new investigators owing to the free-
dom  to  create  an  application  to  pursue  any  area  of  science  NIH  sup-
ports without waiting for a particular funding announcement. Moreover,
new investigators pursuing investigator-initiated research opportunities
receive  a  higher  pay  line  than  established  investigators,  whereas  there
is  no  pay  differential  for  new  investigators  pursuing  solicited  research
opportunities (NIAID, 2016). All applications are submitted in response
to  Funding  Opportunity  Announcements  (FOAs),  which  are  publicly
available documents in which NIH describes its intentions to make dis-
cretionary awards for which it selects the awardees and/or the amounts
of funding via a competitive process.7 FOAs can range from an NIH-wide
umbrella  announcement  that  channels  investigator-initiated  research
applications, to a single IC’s announcement to solicit applications for a
clearly defined scientific area in order to fulfill specific objectives8  (NIH
Office of Extramural Research, 2021). CSR is the entry point for all NIH
grant,  fellowship,  and  cooperative  agreement  applications  (CSR,  2021;
Hodge, 2021).

7 Non-discretionary awards, which are uncommon, are made to specific recipients, in ac-
cordance with statutory, eligibility, and compliance requirements. The award amount could
be determined specifically or by formula (NIH Office of Extramural Research, 2021).

8 The most common FOA types are as follows. Program Announcements (PAs) are state-
ments  about  a  new  or  ongoing  activity  or  program  that  may  also  invite  applications  for
grant support. Requests for applications (RFAs) solicit grant or cooperative agreement ap-
plications in a well-defined scientific area to accomplish specific program objectives. Parent
Announcements are omnibus announcements that enable applicants to submit investigator-
initiated  applications.  Notices  of  Special  Interest  (NOSI)  highlight  a  topic  of  interest  and
direct applicants to one or more FOAs (often Parent Announcements) to submit applications
for the initiative (NIH Office of Extramural Research, 2021).

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH EFFORTS

295

CSR’s Division of Receipt and Referral reviews grant applications for
completeness and compliance with NIH policies and makes two referral
assignments  for  each  application  (Hodge,  2021;  NIH).  The  first  assign-
ment is to one or more NIH ICs for potential funding based on guidelines
that each IC provides to CSR for assignment purposes, and these guide-
lines may include shared interests among different ICs (Hodge, 2021). The
ICs’ assignment guidelines are not available to the public (Hodge, 2021).
The second assignment is to either a CSR review group, the case for 75
percent of applications, or to IC review groups associated with solicited
FOAs (Murrin, 2019).

CSR  scientific  review  groups,  also  called  study  sections,  review  the
applications  for  scientific  merit  (CSR,  2020).  Information  on  each  study
section, including its reviewers, topics covered, and overlap with related
study sections, is available on the NIH website.9

There  are  two  kinds  of  CSR  study  sections,  chartered  and  special
emphasis panels (CSR, 2020). Chartered, also called standing or recurring,
study  sections  review  most  investigator-initiated  research  applications;
the sections consist of members who are “primarily non-federal scientists
with  expertise  in  consist  of  scientific  disciplines  and  current  research
areas” (NIH, 2018).

Special  emphasis  panels  perform  reviews  when  the  subject  matter
does not match up with a study section, when assigning a project to an
appropriate study section might create a conflict of interest, or in the case
of certain types of applications such as fellowships, Small Business Inno-
vation Research, and Small Business Technology Transfer Research appli-
cations  (CSR,  2020;  Hodge,  2021;  NIH,  2013). A special  emphasis  panel
consists  of  temporary  members  whom  CSR  recruits  based  on  expertise
needed for each meeting.

CSR  assigns  each  application  to  a  Scientific  Review  Officer  (SRO)
(NIH, 2013). An SRO is an extramural staff scientist who is the designated
federal official responsible for ensuring an application meets peer-review
requirements  and  for  managing  the  review  process  (NIH,  2018;  NIMH,
2021). The two-stage review process involves evaluation by a panel of pri-
marily non-federal scientists, and approval by the IC Advisory Council/
Board and the IC Director (NIH, 2018, 2019a).

In the first stage of review, assigned reviewers provide their prelimi-
nary assessments and critiques to the SRO, who uses them to plan and
frame the session with the fully convened study section (CSR, 2020; NIH,
2018).  The  section  chair  and  the  SRO  partner  to  run  the  study  section
review meeting (NIH, 2018). At the meeting, the assigned reviewers pres-
ent a critique of the application, and members then discuss the application

in  depth  (Hodge,  2021;  NIH,  2013,  2018).  The  members  each  provide  a
final overall impact score (Hodge, 2021; NIH, 2013, 2018).

In  the  second  stage  of  review,  the  Advisory  Council  or  Board  of
the  assigned  IC,  comprising  “both  scientific  and  public  representatives
selected for their expertise, interest, or activity in matters related to health
and disease,” makes funding recommendations based on the results of the
study section’s review and the IC’s programs and priorities (Hodge, 2021;
NIH,  2013,  2018)  The  directors  of  the  ICs  make  the  final  funding  deci-
sions (NIH, 2018). Figure 5-3 depicts an overview of the process. Chapter
6  discusses  CSR  study  sections  that  review  applications  that  focus  on
autoimmune diseases.

The ICs use a similar process to review grant applications submitted
in response to solicited FOAs, but they convene ad hoc special emphasis
panels with expertise appropriate for each separate FOA (NIAID, 2020).
NIH uses a broad range of activity codes to categorize funding mech-
anisms for research activities. Extramural research activities are typically
grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements (NIH, 2019b). Investigator-
initiated research project grants, so-called R01 grants, are considered the
traditional  grant  mechanism  and  constitute  the  largest  single  type  of
support  NIH  provides  (NIH,  2021g).  For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the
committee was also interested in fellowships, research career programs,
training programs, and cooperative agreements. Table 5-2 provides a brief
description of these grants.

Intramural Research Funding

The NIH Intramural Research Program (IRP) supports research con-
ducted  on  the  NIH  campuses,  and  23  of  the  27  ICs  have  an  intramu-
ral  component  (IRP,  2021a;  NIH,  2017b).  Priority  setting  for  intramural
research  projects  is  based  on  prior  investigator  success  and  innovative
ideas, often in collaboration with investigators in other ICs or with extra-
mural researchers.

The IRP budget supports more than 1,200 principal investigators and
4,000 postdoctoral fellows who conduct basic, translational, and clinical
research (IRP, 2021b, 2021c). IRP principal investigators receive a review
of their work every 4 years, and the external reviews are primarily retro-
spective (IRP, 2021a; Kastner, 2021; Rider, 2021). The IRP approach repre-
sents NIH’s commitment to individual researchers rather than individual
projects, as is the case with extramural investigators, providing support
for high-risk, high-reward projects not easily funded by R01 projects and
for long-term studies requiring stable funding.

NIH Initiatives

NIH supports a number of specific initiatives. Initiatives originate in
multiple ways, which include externally through congressional mandates,
congressional language that is not a mandate, or direction from the Execu-
tive Branch (e.g., via HHS) as well as internally from the NIH OD, IC lead-
ership and staff, or internal coordinating bodies. Directions from Congress
or the Executive Branch are announced publicly, have specific goals, and
may  or  may  not  have  set-aside  funding  to  support  the  goals.  ICs  may
propose  their  own  initiatives  with  or  without  dedicated  funding.  NIH
initiatives may also derive from and be coupled with private-sector initia-
tives, with variable sharing of funds. Examples of the latter include large
registries or clinical care consortia created by advocacy groups, strength-
ened in structure and resources by NIH or NIH-sponsored research, that
pharmaceutical companies can use.

Select NIH Autoimmune Disease Research Efforts

The previous discussion provided a brief overview of NIH funding
and the process for awarding grants. The next section focuses more spe-
cifically on autoimmune disease research activities. For the purpose of this
report and the timeframe available to the committee to conduct its work,
the committee chose to limit its review to the OD and 13 NIH ICs—the
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK),
National  Institute  of Allergy  and  Infectious  Diseases  (NIAID),  National
Institute  of  Arthritis  and  Musculoskeletal  Diseases  (NIAMS),  National
Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Heart,
Lung,  and  Blood  Institute  (NHLBI),  NCI,  National  Eye  Institute  (NEI),
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), National
Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), National Institute of Envi-
ronmental  Health  Sciences  (NIEHS),  Eunice  Kennedy  Schriver  National
Institute  of  Child  Health  and  Human  Development  (NICHD),  National
Human  Genome  Research  Institute  (NHGRI),  and  National  Center  for
Advancing  Translational  Sciences  (NCATS)—that  supported  the  major-
ity of autoimmune disease research through intramural and extramural
programs  in  FY 2020  based  on  the  total  amount  of  funding  (see  Figure
5-4).10 Table 5-3 presents the general mission statements of the select NIH
ICs. The committee notes that of these, the general mission of six Institutes
focus on diseases, and six focus on organ systems or anatomy.

These ICs have different missions, favor different funding mechanism
priorities, and focus on different autoimmune diseases. While they offer
more detailed disease-specific interests in their website-searchable data-
bases (Table 5-3), their reporting formats are not standardized, nor do they
indicate how they choose diseases. Some listed diseases are common, such
as rheumatoid arthritis, a focus of NIAMS, and some are exceedingly rare,
such as autoimmune encephalitis, a focus of NINDS. Other diseases are
lethal, such as vasculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which
are areas of focus for NIAMS and NIDDK, while others are not lethal but
cause life disruption treatable with today’s technologies, such as Hashi-
moto’s thyroiditis and Graves’ disease, a focus of NIDDK. The complexity
and  diversity  in  the  group  of  autoimmune  diseases  has  contributed  to
how research and other efforts to understand the diseases are dispersed
across NIH ICs, which in turn may lead to siloing of efforts if there are no
systematic attempts to coordinate activities across NIH. Yet another per-
spective can be seen when considering a disease such as Sjögren’s disease.

10 The committee notes that many investigators funded by NIH also receive support from
philanthropy,  industry,  and  other  private-sector  sources.  The  committee  did  not  seek  to
quantify or outline the relative contributions of these other sectors.

Sjögren’s disease is a prototypical, multisystemic autoimmune disease. Its
manifestations include mucosal and ocular abnormalities, arthritis, respi-
ratory and renal failure, multiple autoantibodies, cytopenias, neuropathy,
maternal autoantibody-induced neonatal disease, and lymphadenopathy
and   lymphoma.   Because   it  involves   so   many  organ   systems,   Sjögren’s
disease  does  not have  “a  home”  in  NIH;  NIAMS,  NIAID,  NEI,  NINDS,
NHLBI,   NCI,   NICHD,   and   NIDCR   all   can  legitimately  claim   primary
interest in  grants  focusing on  this  disease.

In  an  effort  to  categorize  the  autoimmune  diseases  relevant  to  the
ICs in Table 5-3, the committee had to gather information from a variety
of  sources  since  such  information  was  not  readily  available  from  a  sole
source. The committee relied on presentations by invited speakers from
the  ICs  during  the  committee’s  information-gathering  public  sessions,
publicly available information on the ICs’ websites, and committee mem-
bers’ expert knowledge. The categorization of the ICs in Table 5-3, based
on  their  mission  statements  and  other  publicly  available  information,
reveals the broad and sometimes overlapping missions and focus areas

as  they  pertain  to  autoimmune  diseases  research.  While  there  is  some
evidence  of  attempts  to  coordinate  funding  and  research  efforts  among
the  ICs,  it  was  difficult  for  the  committee  to  assess  how  effective  these
efforts were, as discussed later in this chapter. Table 5-3 summarizes the
autoimmune disease research focus of each IC, which range from basic to
translational and clinical research.

Strategic Planning for Autoimmune Disease Research at NIH

ICs  engage  in  a  strategic  process  to  set  research  priorities.  In  an
effort to understand whether and how the various ICs prioritize autoim-
mune diseases as part of their overarching institutional plans and vision
planning, the committee reviewed the strategic plans for the 13 ICs that
funded most of the autoimmune diseases work in FY 2020. The strategic
plans  offer  insights  into  what  the  ICs  consider  to  be  the  most  pressing
issues  that  they  can  tackle  within  their  mission  and  vision,  as  well  as
those issues that will hold the most promise for advancing their respective
fields. Complicating the committee’s review of the strategic plans was the
fact that there is no standardized approach and timeline by which the ICs
release their reports (Table 5-4). Some ICs, such as NCI, release plans as
part of the annual budget planning process to the President and Congress.
Other  Institutes—NIAMS,  NIDDK,  and  NIGMS—release  5-year  plans,
while others—NHGRI, NIEHS, and NICHD—release reports periodically
at intervals of 6 to 10 years. The committee found information about past
reports to assess the frequency of the strategic planning process for some
of  the  ICs,  including  NIAID,  NHLBI,  and  NEI.  This  lack  of  standard-
ization  across  ICs  and  consistency  in  the  release  of  strategic  plans  for
individual ICs has important implications since it may pose an obstacle
for ICs in coordinating their strategic planning efforts, and subsequently,
their  funding  and  research  efforts  for  autoimmune  diseases.  While  the
timeframe covered by some of the strategic plans overlap, the plans are
at various stages of implementation.

Regarding the process for strategic planning, not all the ICs document
their approach, so the committee was unable to fully evaluate how the ICs
identified  scientific  and  programmatic  priorities  outlined  in the  strategic
plans.   Some   of   the   ICs,   as   discussed   in  the   section   below,   go   through   a
detailed   process   spanning  1   to   2   years   that  includes   issuing  a   Request
for   Information   (RFI)   to   solicit  stakeholder   feedback  on  their   proposed
themes or areas of focus. Broad and varied stakeholder input is essential
for  comprehensively surveying the  field  and  ensuring that the  priorities
identified   reflect  what  a   variety  of   stakeholder   groups   consider   as   the
most pressing issues.

The various strategic plans reference autoimmune diseases and issues
of autoimmunity to varying degrees or not at all, as the discussion below
notes for each individual IC. The Institutes that funded the most autoim-
mune diseases research and whose missions and focus align directly with
autoimmune diseases—NIAMS, NIDDK, and NIAID—were more likely
to mention the autoimmune diseases in their strategic plan. NIEHS, which
is not a major funder of autoimmune diseases research, made mention of
autoimmune diseases in its recent plan (FY 2018 to 2023) (NIEHS, 2018).

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH EFFORTS

313

NIAMS

The current NIAMS strategic plan covers FY 2020 to 2024 and includes
a section on scientific objectives that are disease and tissue specific, one
of which is to advance and speed systemic rheumatic and autoimmune
diseases research, and crosscutting themes of focus for NIAMS. The cross-
cutting scientific themes NIAMS identified acknowledge that most of the
scientific  challenges  and  opportunities  transcend  a  single  disease  area
or organ (NIAMS, 2020b). The four themes identified are all relevant to
autoimmune diseases:

•	  “Precision medicine for arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin
diseases”  (NIAMS,  2020b).  This  involves,  but  is  not  limited  to,
leveraging new technologies and computational tools to improve
knowledge of the molecular basis of health and disease.

•	  “Shared  mechanisms  in  health  and  among  diseases.”  Focus
areas include immunity and inflammation and the effects of envi-
ronmental exposures.

•	  “Patient-centric  approaches  to  health  and  disease.”  Capturing
patient-reported  perspectives  using  tools  such  as  the  Patient-
Reported  Outcomes  Measurement  Information  System  (PRO-
MIS®) as part of the research process.

•	  “Health  and  disease  in  diverse  populations.”  Promoting  the
relevance  of  NIAMS-funded  research  in  groups  that  have  been
historically underrepresented in biomedical research in order to
effect health equity for all populations.

The report also identifies aspirations or thematic issues that are ger-
mane to multiple diseases or conditions at NIAMS and those that hold the
most promise for the future given the NIAMS portfolio (NIAMS, 2020b).
The two most relevant for autoimmune diseases are:


“Biomarkers will guide the choice of the most effective therapy
for each individual rheumatoid arthritis patient […and]

•	  “Preventive therapy will delay the onset of autoimmune diseases

like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis” (NIAMS, 2020b).

Independently of its IC-specific strategic plans, NIAMS published the
Action Plan for Lupus Research in 2015, intending that it supplement ongo-
ing  long-term  plans  as  well  as  the  work  of  the  Lupus  Federal  Working
Group (LFWG) and the Autoimmune Diseases Coordinating Committee
(ADCC) (NIAMS, 2015). More information on these organizations appears
later in this chapter.

314

NIDDK

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

NIDDK established a Working Group of Council, consisting of 44 exter-
nal scientists and patient advocates to provide input during the strategic
planning process for its most recent strategic plan, which the Institute pub-
lished in December 2021 (NIDDK, 2021b, 2021c). It issued an RFI in 2020
to seek input from different stakeholders, “including the scientific research
community; patients and caregivers; health care providers and health advo-
cacy organizations; scientific and professional organizations; federal agen-
cies; and other stakeholders, including interested members of the public,”
on the thematic considerations for the 5-year strategic plan (NIDDK, 2021b).
After developing a draft strategic plan, NIDDK issued another RFI for the
period August 10–31, 2021, to elicit feedback on the draft.

The strategic plan includes four major goals:


“Advance  understanding  of  biological  pathways  and  environ-
mental contributors to health and disease […and]

•	  Advance pivotal clinical studies and trials for prevention, treat-

ment, and cures in diverse populations […and]

•	  Advance research to disseminate and implement evidence-based
prevention  strategies  and  treatments  in  clinics  and  community
settings, to improve the health of more people, more rapidly and
more effectively […and]

	 Advance stakeholder engagement — including patients and other

participants as true partners in research” (NIDDK, 2021c).

NIAID

The most recent NIAID-wide strategic plan is from 2017, and devel-
opment  of  a  new  one  is  not  yet  scheduled.11  The  budget  and  planning
page  of  NIAID’s  website12  does  include  strategic  plans  for  various  dis-
eases and conditions and research areas, such as COVID-19, hepatitis B,
tickborne disease research, vaccine adjuvants, and tuberculosis (NIAID,
2021b). NIAID’s last published strategic plan (NIAID, 2017) outlined the
Institute’s  then-current  research  priorities  to  inform  its  future  decision
making. The plan identified four scientific areas of focus, one of which is
“allergy, immunology, and immune-mediated diseases,” including auto-
immune  disease.  For  this  specific  area,  it  emphasizes  applying  under-
standing of the human immune system in continuing to support immu-
nology  research  that  provides  preclinical  information  that  is  crucial  to

developing new strategies to diagnose, treat, and prevent infectious and
immune-mediated diseases. Another area of emphasis involves support-
ing clinical trial networks committed to treating and preventing allergic
and autoimmune diseases and to preventing graft rejection. A third and
final area of emphasis identified for this scientific area involves determin-
ing the precise mechanisms of human immune regulation (NIAID, 2017).

NINDS

NINDS organized its FY 2021 to 2026 strategic plan by focus areas that

are not disease specific (NINDS, 2020). The four areas are:



“Science: Support and perform rigorous and important neurosci-
ence research.

	 Training and Diversity: Fund and conduct neuroscience research
training  and  career  development  programs  to  ensure  a  vibrant,
talented, and diverse neuroscience workforce.

•	  Communications: Promote dynamic communication and diverse
stakeholder  engagement  to  accelerate  scientific  progress  and
reduce the burden of neurological disorders.

•	  Workforce Culture: Create and sustain a supportive work culture
for the NINDS workforce that becomes the model for biomedical
research and the neuroscience community” (NINDS, 2020).

While the strategic plan does not mention specific autoimmune dis-
eases, NINDS seeks to advance research on the basic science and mecha-
nisms of nervous system function in order to advance efforts to prevent
and  treat  neurological  disorders.  In  addition,  NINDS  will  support  the
development  and  validation  of  biomarkers  and  outcome  measures  that
are required to enable better and targeted therapeutic options for patients.
The strategic plan also indicates as part of its science focus that is has a
goal of supporting work to prevent neurological disorders and advance
health equity (NINDS, 2020).

As  part  of  its  crosscutting  strategies,  the  plan  indicates  NINDS’s
intention to rely primarily on investigator-initiated research for its funded
portfolio,  but  notes  that  productive  collaborations  and  partnerships  are
essential as scientific advances highlight intersections between the inter-
ests of NINDS and other organizations (NINDS, 2020).

NHLBI

The  most  recent  strategic  plan  available  for  NHLBI  is  from  2016
(NHLBI, 2016). This report is organized according to 4 goals, 8 strategic

316

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

objectives, 132 research priorities, and 12 critical challenges, the latter of
which the strategic plan defines as obstacles to scientific progress, which
when overcome, will result in significant impact. The report’s fifth stra-
tegic  objective—developing  and  optimizing  new  diagnostic  and  thera-
peutic strategies to prevent, treat, and cure heart, lung, blood, and sleep
diseases—states  that  one  of  its  critical  challenges  is  to  understand  the
immune system from a systems biology perspective as a means of design-
ing  more  efficacious  treatment  strategies  for  chronic  inflammatory  and
autoimmune heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases. This critical challenge
was  the  only  explicit  reference  to  autoimmune  diseases  in  the  strategic
plan.  The  critical  challenges,  along  with  a  set  of  compelling  questions,
constitute NHLBI’s strategic research priorities (NHLBI, 2016).

The  NHLBI  plan  mentions  that  investigator-initiated  projects  will
continue  to  be  the  Institute’s  primary  focus,  but  it  also  acknowledges
the importance of NHLBI-solicited research initiatives supported by new
FOAs and that the plan’s strategic research priorities will shape the devel-
opment of future FOAs and other activities (NHLBI, 2016).

NEI

On November 1, 2021, NEI released a strategic plan for 2021 to 2025
(NEI, 2021b). This strategic plan is the ninth comprehensive plan for the
Institute since it was established; the plan prior to the current plan was
published  in  August  2012.  The  new  plan  has  seven  areas  of  emphasis
within three research domains: “1) Visual system in health and diseases;
2)  Capitalizing  on  emerging  fields;  and  3)  Preventing  vision  loss  and
enhancing  wellbeing”  (NEI,  2021b).  One  of  the  focus  areas  within  the
first research domain is “immune system and eye health” (NEI, 2021b),
which will address how NEI can develop crosscutting program priorities
and overarching goals for ocular immunology, infection, and inflamma-
tion biology. As part of this goal, NEI’s focus is to support research that
develops  targeted  therapeutics  for  ocular  immune-related  diseases  and
improve  imaging,  biomarkers,  and  data  analytics  to  support  precision
medicine for immune-mediated eye diseases, among other research goals.
As  with  some  of  the  other  ICs,  NEI  points  to  how  it  leverages  partner-
ships both within and outside of NIH to advance its mission and research
priorities (NEI, 2021b).

NIEHS

The most recent version of the NIEHS strategic plan spans the years

2018 to 2023 and is organized around three themes:

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH EFFORTS

317


“Advancing environmental health sciences

	 Promoting translation – data to knowledge to action
	 Enhancing  environmental  health  sciences  through  stewardship

and support” (NIEHS, 2018).

Inflammation effects that result in autoimmune disorders is one major
area of research interest identified for the first theme. In addition, NIEHS’s
goals  for  advancing  environmental  health  sciences  include  supporting
research  on  the  effects  of  the  environment  on  biological  systems  and
processes,  which  may  have  implications  for  many  diseases,  including
autoimmune diseases (NIEHS, 2018).

NHGRI

NHGRI released its current strategic plan in 2020, following versions
it issued in 2003 and 2011 (Green et al., 2020). In the plan, NHGRI identi-
fied four interrelated strategic areas that are at “the forefront of genomics”
or are opportunities for human genomics in the next decade (Green et al.,
2020). These areas are not disease specific, but overarching principles for
genomics research that fall into the categories of:


“Guiding principles and values for human genomics
Sustaining and improving a robust foundation for genomics

	 Breaking down barriers that impede progress in genomics
	 Compelling genomics research projects in biomedicine” (Green et

al., 2020).

While  NHGRI  funds  and  conducts  some  research  on  autoimmune
diseases, its strategic vision does not mention them specifically (Green et
al., 2020). It is conceivable that some of the details identified in the broad
categories delineated above may have implications for several diseases,
including autoimmune diseases.

NCI

NCI  releases  an  institutional  plan  and  budget  annually  for  submis-
sion  to  the  President  and  Congress. A summary  document  of  the  most
current  version,  for  FY  2023  (NCI,  2021a),  highlights  four  focus  areas:
(1)  clinical  trials,  (2)  computer-based  drug  design,  (3)  precision  preven-
tion,  and  (4)  tumor  dynamics.  The  first  highlighted  area  of  the  FY 2023
plan could have implications for autoimmune disease research in that a
focus on expanding telemedicine into clinical trials could increase access
to autoimmune disease trials in underserved communities. Similarly for

318

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

the third highlighted area, a focus on precision-medicine approaches to
prevention could aid in developing personalized prevention approaches
for autoimmune diseases based on genetics, family history, environmental
exposures, and behaviors.

The  FY  2022  summary  document  (NCI,  2021b)  highlighted  four
focus areas including “cancer drug resistance, molecular diagnostics for
cancer treatment, obesity and cancer, and cancer survivorship.” The FY
2021 plan summary (NCI, 2019a) identified three opportunities in cancer
research:  “the  immune  system  and  microbiome,  artificial  intelligence,
and  implementation  science.”  The  FY 2021  plan’s  first  area  of  research,
which focuses on harnessing the immune system in the development of
immunotherapies,  may  have  implications  for  individuals  with  autoim-
mune  diseases,  as  trials  for  existing  immunotherapies  have  excluded
these individuals (NCI, 2019b).

NIGMS

NIGMS released its current strategic plan in 2021. True to NIGMS’s
mission, which is crosscutting in nature to support biomedical research
in  general,  the  plan  (NIGMS,  2021)  is  organized  around  five  goals  that
include sustaining support for investigator-initiated research and invest-
ing  in  developing  a  skilled  and  diverse  biomedical  research  workforce.
NIGMS has supported some autoimmune diseases-focused research, so
its goals may have relevance for the field of autoimmune diseases.

NIDCR

NIDCR released an RFI in August 2019 to solicit stakeholder input for
its 2020 to 2025 strategic plan, but decided to postpone the plan release
following  the  retirement  of  the  former  director  in  December  2019  and
pending the installation of a new director who would provide new lead-
ership and direction for the Institute (NIDCR, 2021b). The FY 2021–2026
strategic  plan  will  be  organized  around  five  priority  areas,  all  of  which
could  potentially  have  a  bearing  on  autoimmune  diseases,  such  as  SLE
and  Sjögren’s  disease,  that  involve  dental,  oral,  and  craniofacial  (DOC)
diseases (NIDCR, 2021b). These include:



“Advancing cross-disciplinary fundamental research in the bio-
medical, behavioral, social, and environmental sciences and driv-
ing translation toward early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment
of DOC diseases and conditions across the lifespan.

	 Developing more precise and individualized ways of managing

and preventing DOC diseases.

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH EFFORTS

319




	 Accelerating research translation and the uptake of new discover-
ies into oral and general healthcare practices that reduce health
inequities and disparities and improve oral health outcomes for
individuals and communities worldwide.

	 Nurture  future  generations  of  DOC  researchers  and  oral  health
professional  scholars  who  can  address  existing  and  emerging
challenges  driven  by  personalized  and  public  health  needs  and
a  continually  evolving  landscape  of  science  and  technology
advances.

	 Expanding existing partnerships and create new ones to advance
the NIDCR research enterprise and increase its reach and impact”
(NIDCR, 2021b).

NICHD

NICHD’s  most  recent  strategic  plan  is  for  the  year  2020,  having
released  its  previous  two  strategic  plans  in  2000  and  2012.  The  report
is organized around five themes, which include an emphasis on under-
standing  the  biological  basis  of  development;  promoting  gynecologic,
andrologic, and reproductive health; promoting healthy pregnancies and
lifelong  wellness;  improving  the  health  of  children  and  adolescents  as
they transition into adulthood; and safe, effective therapies and devices
for  pregnant  women,  children,  and  individuals  with  disabilities.  While
the  strategic  plan  does  not  focus  on  specific  diseases  or  conditions,  the
plan mentions how the results from NICHD-funded researchers working
with  maternal  mouse  models  that  showed  the  persistence  of  fetal  cells
post-delivery could offer insight into diseases that affect women, includ-
ing autoimmune diseases (NICHD, 2019).

NCATS

NCATS  was  established  in  2011  and  has  published  a  strategic  plan
from  2016  (NCATS,  2016).  The  Center’s  research  is  not  disease  specific
but rather focuses on disease commonalities and the translational process.
The  NCATS  strategic  plan  is  organized  around  four  strategies,  and  the
first, and most relevant for autoimmune diseases, is to conduct and sup-
port innovative research to reveal fundamental scientific and operational
principles of translational science to drive the development and dissemi-
nation of novel medical interventions. Among several objectives listed to
support this strategy are (1) “to identify biological commonalities among
diseases  and  use  insight  into  shared  mechanisms  and  pathways  to  test
and treat multiple human diseases and conditions” (NCATS, 2016), and
(2) to “drive development of medical interventions for rare diseases that

320

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

lack safe and effective treatments” (NCATS, 2016). The plan also points
out obstacles that can limit the progress of translational science such as a
lack of data interoperability; “a shortage of qualified biomarkers to diag-
nose disease and measure treatment response”; and “inadequate devel-
opment  and  measurement  of  appropriate  clinical  outcome  measures  or
endpoints, including patient-reported outcomes.” While no diseases are
named in the plan, translational science research could benefit the field of
autoimmune diseases (NCATS, 2016).

In summary, the committee notes the inherent difficulty in assessing
the priorities of the ICs as it pertains to autoimmune diseases (as discussed
earlier in this chapter). While ICs develop their strategic plans indepen-
dently, on different schedules, and focus on broad thematic issues, there
are sufficient commonalities in the themes and priority areas highlighted
across the strategic plans that the committee reviewed to indicate that the
process could benefit from a concerted effort. For example, some of the ICs,
such as NIAMS and NEI, highlighted the development of biomarkers that
will aid in the delivery of precision medicine. NIAID, NIAMS, and NIEHS
all prioritized additional research on the basic science and mechanisms of
the human immune system, and NIAMS also mentions the importance of
understanding the effects of environmental exposures, which is a shared
goal with NIEHS. Beyond scientific issues, a few of the ICs, such as NIDDK
and NIAMS, highlight other priority areas such as the importance of the
patient as partner in the research process, and NIAMS and NCATS call for
the  use  of  patient-reported  outcomes  in  research.  Better  coordination  in
strategic planning and priority setting efforts across the ICs could enable
the ICs to harness their expertise and resources effectively to address the
pressing issues in autoimmune diseases research.

CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS AND NIH

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

On  numerous  occasions,  Congress  has  issued  mandates  pertaining
to autoimmune disease research at NIH. Constituents, advocacy groups,
and other stakeholders who request congressional action on autoimmune
diseases research have contributed greatly to such action, often through
organized  advocacy  efforts  (Autoimmune  Association,  2021;  Keenan,
2020). These mandates provide direction and in some cases funding for
specific  activities  NIH-wide  or  at  the  IC  level.  This  section  provides  an
illustrative selection of specific mandates.

The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 199313 directed
multiple  ICs  to  pursue  research  on  specific  autoimmune  diseases.  The

13 National  Institutes  of  Health  Revitalization  Act  of  1993,  Public  Law  103-43,  103rd  Cong.,

1st sess. (June 10, 1993).

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH EFFORTS

321

Act  tasked  NIAMS  to  develop  a  plan  to  expand  research  into  etiology,
prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of arthritis affecting
children; to establish a disease center for this purpose; and to make recom-
mendations for expanding funding for such research. The Act encouraged
NIAID  to  collaborate  with  external  entities  to  research  chronic  fatigue
syndrome,  issue  research  grants  to  study  it,  establish  an  extramural
study section to review related research, appoint experts on the disease
to appropriate NIH advisory  committees and boards, and report  on NIH’s
work  and   priorities   involving  the   disease.   The  Act  also   enabled   NEI   to
issue  grants  to  support a  variety of  basic  and  clinical  research  on  diabetes
and the eye and to improve patient care. Furthermore, the  Act directed
NINDS  to  conduct  and  support  research  on  multiple  sclerosis,  particu-
larly the effects of genetics and hormonal changes on disease progression.
Congress  did  not include  appropriations  language  for  these  efforts.

One directive that has been renewed over many years is the Special
Statutory Funding Program for Type 1 Diabetes Research, or Special Dia-
betes Program, a special appropriation for research on type 1 diabetes that
NIDDK administers on behalf of the HHS Secretary in collaboration with
multiple ICs and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and  with  input  from  the  Diabetes  Mellitus  Interagency  Coordinating
Committee.  Begun  in  1998,  the  Special  Diabetes  Program  established
collaborative  research  consortia  and  clinical  trials  networks  dedicated
to  preventing,  treating,  and  curing  type  1  diabetes. Annual  funding  for
the program has grown over time from $30 million to the current level of
$150 million.14

The  Children’s  Health  Act  of  200015  called  for  the  NIH  Director  to
“expand, intensify, and coordinate research and other activities involving
autoimmune diseases among the institutes.” It also requested establishing
an Autoimmune Diseases Coordinating Committee (ADCC) to coordinate
activities across NIH and with other federal health programs. Its members
would include representatives of germane NIH ICs, federal departments,
and  agencies,  including  CDC  and  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration
(FDA). The ADCC was to create a plan for “conducting and supporting
a broad range of research and education activities relating to biomedical,
psychosocial,  and  rehabilitative  issues,  including  studies  of  the  dispro-
portionate impact of such diseases on women.” It was to determine NIH
priorities  for  autoimmune  diseases,  which  would  “reflect  input  from  a
broad range of scientists, patients, and advocacy groups.” Planning was to
include research to identify the reasons for the incidence and prevalence

cember 27, 2020).

15 Children’s  Health  Act  of  2000,  Public  Law  106-310,  106th  Cong.  2nd  sess.  (October  17,

2000).

322

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

of the diseases; basic research of causes; epidemiologic studies on disease
frequency and progression, including disparities among sexes and racial
and  ethnic  groups;  improvement  of  screening  techniques;  and  clinical
research to develop treatments. The  ADCC was also to plan information
and  education  programs  for  the  public  and  medical  community.  The
ADCC  would  issue  reports  to  Congress  on  autoimmune  disease-related
activities  conducted   or   supported   by  NIH  and   the   cost  of   NIH   activi-
ties  for  each  disease,  and  would  identify appropriate  future  projects  for
consideration  by   NIH  or  other  research  entities.  Congress  authorized
appropriations  for FY  2001 through 2005, but the language did not include
amounts.

The Children’s Health Act of 2000 also asked NIAMS and NIAID to
expand and intensify programs for research and other activities involv-
ing juvenile arthritis and related conditions. Congress authorized NIAMS
and NIAID to be appropriated “such sums as may be necessary” for FY
2001 through FY 2005. In addition, the Act directed NIDDK to conduct or
support  long-term  epidemiology  studies  in  those  who  have  or  who  are
at  risk  for  type  1  diabetes  in  order  examine  the  causes,  characteristics,
and complications of the disease, and to undertake an effort to support
regional clinical research centers for preventing, detecting, treating, and
curing juvenile arthritis and related conditions. NIH was to join HHS in
a  national  effort  to  increase  “research  and  development  of  prevention
strategies, including consideration of vaccine development, coupled with
appropriate ability to evaluate the effectiveness of such strategies in large
clinical trials of children and young adults.” NIDDK was to be appropri-
ated  sums  for  FY  2001  through  2005,  but  the Act  did  not  specify  what
those sums should be.

Another  statute  Congress  passed  in  2000  was  the  Public  Health
Improvement Act,16 which included directives to extend and intensify the
study of SLE and charged NIAMS with coordinating with other ICs doing
work related to SLE. NIAMS was asked to conduct or support research to
include investigating the reasons for the preponderance of SLE in women,
including  African  American  women;  basic  research  on  disease  causes;
epidemiologic studies to examine disease progression, its frequency, and
difference  between  sexes  and  racial  and  ethnic  groups;  development  of
improved  diagnostic  techniques;  and  clinical  research  to  develop  and
evaluate new treatments. The Act also directed NIAMS to develop infor-
mation and education programs for the health care community and the
public.  It  was  authorized  appropriations  for  FY 2001  through  2003,  but
the Act did not specify sums.

Congress enacted the Rare Diseases Act of 200217 with the intent of
increasing  the  study  of  rare  diseases  and  disorders—“defined  as  those
affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States”—and the
Act includes Crohn’s disease as an example of a rare disease. NIH created
the Office of Rare Diseases in 1993, but it lacked statutory authorization,
so  the  Act  requested  that  NIH  establish  the  Office  within  the  OD.  The
Act directed the Office to recommend a varied research and educational
agenda and to promote coordination and cooperation across the NIH ICs
and  those  they  supported,  and,  in  collaboration  with  directors  of  other
ICs, it was enabled to make cooperative agreements and to award grants
to regional centers of excellence on rare diseases. Other duties specified
for  the  Office  included  promoting  the  establishment  of  an  information
clearinghouse  on  rare  and  genetic  diseases  for  the  public  and  medical
community, liaising with national and international organizations, report-
ing biennially on the activities that had and should occur, and reporting
annually to Congress. The Office was appropriated “such sums as already
have  been  appropriated  for  FY  2002,  and  $4,000,000  for  each  of  the  FY
2003 through 2006” for the purpose of cooperative agreements or grants
for the regional centers of excellence for rare diseases.

Congress  enacted  the  Pancreatic  Islet  Cell  Transplantation  Act  of
200418 to “increase the supply of pancreatic islet cells for research, to pro-
vide for better coordination of Federal efforts and information on islet cell
transplantation.”  Annual  reports  prepared  by  the  NIDDK-led  Diabetes
Mellitus Interagency Coordinating Committee were directed to evaluate
the federal activities and programs related to pancreatic islet transplan-
tation  and  research,  recommend  legislation  to  increase  the  supply  of
pancreas  tissue  for  islet  cell  transplantation,  and  address  the  adequacy
of  federal  funding.  The  Act  did  not  provide  funding  authorization  or
appropriation amounts.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 200919  was a fiscal
stimulus  package  developed  in  response  to  the  Great  Recession.  Of  the
money appropriated to NIH, $7,400,000,000 was transferred to the ICs and
the Common Fund,20 in proportion to the appropriations otherwise made
to them for FY 2009.  The funds were  to be used  to “support  additional
scientific research,” and money was to be consolidated with and used for

17 Rare Diseases Act of 2002, Public Law 107-280, 107th Cong., 2nd sess. (November 6, 2002).
18 Pancreatic  Islet  Cell  Transplantation  Act  of  2004,  Public  Law  108-362,  108th  Cong.,  2nd

(February 17, 2009).

20 Not  included  among  the  recipients  were  the  National  Institutes  of  Health–Buildings
and Facilities, the Center for Scientific Review, the Center for Information Technology, the
Clinical Center, and the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

324

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

“the same purposes as the appropriation or fund to which [it] was trans-
ferred.” In addition, $1,800,000,000 was appropriated to NIH for repair,
renovation,  and  construction  of  non-federal  and  NIH  facilities  and  for
instrumentation and research equipment.

The 21st Century Cures Act,21 enacted in 2016 to expedite the discov-
ery, development, and delivery of new treatment and cures, appropriated
$4.8 billion to biomedical research. While autoimmune disease research
was not specifically named in the Act, the crosscutting nature of autoim-
mune disease research could enable it to benefit from the funding desig-
nated for NIH initiatives such as the NIH Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot,
the  Brain  Research  Through Advancing  Innovative  Neurotechnologies®
(BRAIN)  Initiative,  and  the  Precision  Medicine  Initiative.  In  addition,
funding  was  directed  to  the  Next  Generation  of  Researchers  Initiative
to  help  support  new  researchers,  sustain  research  careers,  and  promote
growth, stability, and diversity of the biomedical research workforce.

In 2018, the National Clinical Care Commission Act22 established an
HHS  Commission,  which  included  NIH  as  a  member,  to  evaluate  and
make recommendations on how to better leverage and coordinate federal
programs related to as many as two metabolic or autoimmune diseases
with  insulin-related  etiology.  In  making  its  recommendations,  the  Act
instructed the Commission to consider preventing and reducing the dis-
eases and complications, “gaps in Federal efforts to support clinicians in
providing integrated high-quality care,” “improvement in and improved
coordination of Federal education and awareness activities related to the
prevention  and  treatment  of  the  diseases,”  methods  for  dissemination
of educational materials, and opportunities for consolidating overlap in
federal programs related to the diseases. The Commission was to submit
an  operating  plan,  which  could  include  a  budget  for  the  Commission’s
activities,  and  a  final  report  to  the  HHS  Secretary  and  Congress,  and  it
decided to focus on type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Congress did not appro-
priate funds for the Commission’s operation, and an HHS Joint Funding
Agreement supported the Commission’s activities (National Clinical Care
Commission, 2018).

Relevant Bills or Resolutions That Did Not Pass

There have been congressional actions directed to NIH autoimmune
disease research efforts that Congress did not pass into law. One example
is  a  bill  that  members  of  Congress  submitted  twice—the  NIH  Office  of

21 21st Century Cures Act, Public Law 114-255, 114th Cong., 2nd sess. (December 13, 2016).
22 National Clinical Care Commission Act, Public Law 115-80, 115th Cong., 1st sess. (Novem-

ber 2, 2017).

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH EFFORTS

325

Autoimmune Diseases Acts of 199823 and 199924—which called for estab-
lishing an Office  of  Autoimmune  Diseases  in  the  NIH  OD.  The  1999  bill
(see  Appendix F)  was  introduced  by then  Senator  Joseph Biden.  Accord-
ing to  that proposed  bill,  the  Director  of  the  Office,  consulting with  the
ADCC,  was  to  recommend  an  agenda  for  autoimmune  disease  research
across  the  ICs.  The  Director  of  the  Office  was  also  to  promote  coordina-
tion   and   cooperation   among  the   ICs   involved   in   autoimmune   disease
research  and  those  supported  by their  research;  promote  NIH  allocation
of  resources  for  such  research;  annually report on  the  research,  including
identifying  projects   that  should   be   conducted   or   supported;   and   serve
as   the   principal   advisor   to   HHS,   NIH,   CDC,   and   FDA   and   other  agen-
cies  regarding autoimmune  diseases.  The  1999  bill authorized  a  FY  2000
appropriation  of  $950,000  (20  percent more  than  that of  the  1998  bill)  as
well  as  “such sums  necessary for  fiscal  years  2001  and  2002.”  While both
bills   required   establishing  or   operating  the  ADCC,   and   the  ADCC   had
been  formed  by  the  time  of  the  1999  bill,  the  establishment  and  duties
of   the  ADCC   were   not  required   by  statute   until   The   Children’s   Health
Act of 2000. In the 2000  Act, the  ADCC was directed to carry out certain
duties   that  had   been   outlined   for   the   proposed   NIH  Office   of  Autoim-
mune Diseases.

Other  select  examples  of  congressional  action  are  the  Scleroderma
Research  and Awareness Act  (Congresses  of  2009–2010,  2011–2012,  and
2013–2014)25,26,27  requesting  the  director  of  NIAMS  to  “expand,  inten-
sify, and coordinate” research of the disease; the Psoriasis and Psoriatic
Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act of 2007,28 2009,29 and 2011,30 which
encouraged the Director of NIH to “explore the development of a virtual

CURRENT COORDINATION OF

AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH AT NIH

Role and Function of the Autoimmune

Diseases Coordinating Committee

NIH established the ADCC in 1998 in response to congressional inter-
est  in  the  autoimmune  diseases  and  the  need  to  coordinate  activities
across the ICs and with other federal health programs and activities for
autoimmune  diseases  (ADCC,  2000).35  The  inaugural  ADCC  member-
ship consisted of representatives of the ICs that are engaged in autoim-
mune  diseases  research,  and  members  from  other  federal  departments
and  agencies  that  focus  on  autoimmune  diseases,  such  as  CDC,  Vet-
erans  Administration,  and  FDA.36  In  addition,  although  Congress  did
not require it, the ADCC extended membership invitations to advocacy

groups and representatives from private autoimmune disease organiza-
tions.37  The  current  membership  of  the ADCC  remains  similar,  and  the
membership of advocacy groups has only continued to grow, providing
these stakeholders with a greater voice (NIAID, 2021a). NIAID is the cur-
rent chair of the ADCC.

In  the  first  2  years  of  its  existence,  the  ADCC  had  several  major
accomplishments,  as  documented  in  its  first  report  released  in  2000
(ADCC, 2000). The committee analyzed information on autoimmune dis-
eases  research  funding  and  research  at  NIH  and  established  multi-IC
collaborative working groups for autoimmune diseases. The ADCC was
also instrumental in enhancing coordination and facilitating private and
public  partnerships  for  autoimmune  disease  research  both  within  the
ICs and with private disease organizations. In FY 1999, NIH “committed
more than $393 million” to support autoimmune disease research (ADCC,
2000). A congressional conference report38  stated that NIAID was being
appropriated more funding for FY 1999 than the House and Senate had
requested,  urged  NIAID  to  expand  autoimmune  disease  research,  and
pointed to the ADCC to provide greater coordination and focus for such
research, which likely facilitated the ADCC’s charge.

The ADCC released reports in 2000, 2002, and 2005, each with a dif-
ferent focus and purpose. The ADCC’s initial report summarized the state
of autoimmune disease research and funding at NIH and identified the
major challenges facing autoimmune diseases research (ADCC, 2000):




“Development of a mechanism-based, conceptual understanding
of autoimmune disease;

	 Translation of this knowledge into new, broadly applicable strate-
gies for treatment and prevention of multiple diseases; and
	 Development of sensitive tools for early and definitive diagnosis,

disease staging, and identification of at-risk individuals.”

The subsequent ADCC report in 2002 (ADCC, 2002) was an autoim-
mune diseases research plan that had been requested by Congress, and it
was informed by an expert panel that identified priority areas for autoim-
mune diseases research and considerations for implementing the research
plan. The research plan had four major areas of emphasis:


“reducing the burden of disease;
enhancing understanding of disease etiology;

improving diagnosis, treatment, and prevention;
increasing training, education; and
information dissemination activities.”

The  report  underscored  the  importance  of  leveraging  scientific  and
clinical  knowledge  to  inform  multiple  autoimmune  diseases  and  coor-
dinating  efforts  to  efficiently  utilize  available  resources  in  both  federal
and private agencies, among others (ADCC, 2002). The report also called
for  Congress  to  appropriate  additional  funds  in  support  of  research  in
autoimmunity.  Congress  authorized  funding  for  developing  the ADCC
research plan through amendments to the Children’s Health Act of 2000
(ADCC,  2002). A resolution  submitted  in  the  House  in  200439  called  for
increase in appropriations to carry out the autoimmune diseases research.
The  committee,  however,  was  unable  to  find  additional  information  on
appropriations for the research plan or its implementation.

The final ADCC report published in 2005 summarized progress made
since the publication of the research plan in 2002 and pointed to funded
and soon-to-be funded activities that signify NIH’s commitment to mak-
ing progress in the areas identified in the research plan and encouraged
continued investments in those areas. The ADCC reports ceased after the
NIH  Reform  Act  of  2006,  which  consolidated  all  the  disparate  reports
required by law from NIH ICs in one comprehensive biennial report to
Congress. As of FY 2016, NIH has further consolidated biennial reporting
into a triennial report (ADCC, 2005).

The amount of NIH reporting to Congress on autoimmune diseases
has changed over time. The ADCC reports ran 33 to 145 pages. In the NIH
biennial  reports  for  the  years  FY  2006  to  2009,  the  autoimmune  disease
section,  which  included  type  1  diabetes,  ran  14  to  19  pages,  and  in  the
reports for FY 2010 to 2013, including a new section on type 1 diabetes,
autoimmune  disease  reporting  ran  9  to  12  pages.  For  the  FY  2014  to
2015 report, including a new diabetes section that intermixed type 1 and
type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease reporting ran 17 pages. In the most
recent report, the first triennial report for the period FY 2016 to 2018, after
including the section combining type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the content on
autoimmune disease totaled 21 pages. The field of autoimmune disease
research  at  NIH  has  expanded  over  time,  yet  the  amount  of  reporting

to Congress on NIH activities and priorities in the field appears to have
diminished.40

While  the ADCC  continues  to  be  active  to  date,  the  committee  was
unable to identify information from publicly available sources to indicate
the extent to which the ADCC’s activities contribute to research and fund-
ing priorities at NIH. The agenda for the last ADCC public meeting held
in May 2020 focused on celiac disease, a topic the group pursued after con-
gressional language addressed concerns about the disease, and featured
invited  speakers  who  addressed  research  gaps  and  opportunities  and
unmet needs according to patients (ADCC, 2020). As a follow-up to this
meeting, “NIH plans to develop a Research, Condition, and Disease Cat-
egory (RCDC) report for celiac disease within the NIH Research Portfolio
Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) website” (NIH, 2021c). Establishing a
celiac disease RCDC category will make all NIH-funded projects related
to celiac disease available in a publicly accessible format. In addition, in
FY 2021, NIAID is “developing a Notice of Special Interest to encourage
investigator-initiated  celiac  disease  research.”  The  ADCC  is  now  using
the process it used for celiac disease to explore other gaps and topics of
interest to the community.41 An earlier public meeting held in April 2019
introduced the Accelerating Medicines Partnerships (AMP), a collabora-
tive initiative for autoimmune diseases sponsored by NIAMS, NIAID, and
other non-NIH partners (ADCC, 2019). Currently, the IC representatives
on the ADCC convene regularly to review shared priorities and activities,
but information about these meetings is not available to the public, so the
committee is unable to report on the scope of current ADCC activities.42
Since its establishment, the ADCC has played a role in coordinating
research activities for autoimmune diseases across the ICs and with non-
NIH external partners. Based on the review of available public informa-
tion  about  the  ADCC,  and  interviews  with  NIAID  representatives,  the
committee notes that the ADCC functions as a convener of ICs and exter-
nal partners and provides a forum for ICs to share information and coor-
dinate their activities on autoimmune disease research. Outside of ADCC
meetings,  ICs  may  decide  to  develop  or  support  collaborative  research
activities influenced in part by their participation in ADCC meetings, but
this was difficult to assess from public documents. Currently, the ADCC

40 The committee is aware that information on autoimmune diseases may appear in the
biennial and triennial reports in sections other than the autoimmune disease and diabetes
sections. The intention was to estimate the clearly indicated content on autoimmune disease
in the reports.

has no dedicated funding or staff; NIH staff who support ADCC opera-
tions do so as part of their general work responsibilities.

Other Modes of Coordination and Collaboration

The committee investigated other mechanisms by which NIH coor-
dinates  and  collaborates  on  autoimmune  disease  research,  both  across
NIH and external to NIH. For example, NIH established the Center for
Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammation as an NIH-wide
“intramural  initiative  designed  to  study  the  human  immune  system”
(NIH,  2012).  Originally,  its  operation  was  supported  jointly  by  several
ICs, and this coordination and collaboration resulted in a study on human
response to influenza vaccine that was collectively useful.43 However, the
Center could not sustain this funding model, partly because of difficulties
in reaching agreement on projects that could yield benefit to all contribu-
tors, and eventually the Center was placed in NIAID.

NIH and FDA created the intramural NIH–FDA Immunology Interest
Group in the 1990s as a part of an effort to foster interaction among scien-
tists across both NIH and FDA, then located on the Bethesda campus.44 It
is one of the largest of such NIH groups and has led to offshoot groups.
Speakers  invited  from  within  and  outside  NIH  deliver  weekly  video
seminars that anyone can view, and a large and active Listserv of some
1,500 listees further encourages collaboration. The Immunology Interest
Group connects trainees and younger investigators with more established
investigators across NIH and external experts, with a major vehicle being
an annual workshop internal to NIH and FDA where approximately 400
attendees present abstracts and posters on active and unpublished work.
The workshop, which the ICs jointly support, includes talks by intramural
and extramural investigators who interact with trainees.

At  the  request  of  Congress,  NIH  established  the  NIAMS-led  Lupus
Federal Working Group (LFWG) in 2003 to facilitate collaboration on SLE
“among  NIH  components,  other  federal  agencies,  voluntary  and  pro-
fessional  organizations,  and  industry  groups  with  an  interest  in  lupus”
(NIAMS,  2019).  With  the  help  of  LFWG  and  others,  NIAMS  published
The Future Directions of Lupus Research in 2007, intended to guide the U.S.
investment in SLE research (NIAMS, 2020a) and a follow-up Action Plan

for Lupus Research in 2015 (NIAMS, 2020a).45 The latter was intended to
“inform priority-setting processes among all lupus-related organizations”
(NIAMS,  2015,  2020a)  but  not  to  dictate  approaches  to  research  or  to
compete with NIAMS’s strategic plans.46  In addition to inviting experts
to  deliver  talks,  LFWG  meetings  serve  as  a  forum  for  hearing  patient
concerns and disseminating information among members.

The National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 200647 directed NIH
to establish DPCPSI, which sits within the NIH OD (DPCPSI, 2021). One
of the Division’s responsibilities is to coordinate the research and activi-
ties of the various Offices that operate within the OD, such as the Office
of AIDS Research and the Office of Research on Women’s Health (ORWH)
(DPCPSI,  2021).  The  missions  of  these  Offices  vary,  but  in  general  they
serve to enhance and promote the research of focus by coordinating and
integrating  activities  across  NIH’s  intramural  and  extramural  activities,
as well as to stimulate and support research, disseminate research results,
educate  the  public,  and  foster  the  development  of  a  workforce  for  the
field (OBSSR, 2021; ORWH, 2021b; SGMRO, 2021). Establishing an office
requires having a research focus that cuts across most NIH ICs, with the
office addressing concerns, particularly roadblocks, that the ICs share.48
For example, NIH-funded researchers were inconsistent in the ways they
recorded sex in clinical and animal trials, and while it was unlikely that
a single IC would undertake advancing the policies and tools to capture
these  data  in  a  uniform  manner,  it  was  appropriate  for  ORWH  to  do
so.  Similarly,  ORWH  initiated  the  Building  Interdisciplinary  Research
Careers  in  Women’s  Health  program,  a  career  development  program,
which “connects junior faculty to senior faculty with a shared interest in
women’s health and sex differences research” (ORWH, 2021a). DPCPSI’s
budget funds the activities of the NIH Offices and their staffs. Although
the Offices can fund research, most can only do so by collaborating with
one or more ICs. Each Office has a coordinating committee of IC repre-
sentatives that serves as a primary coordinating hub to identify areas of
need, gather consensus, and identify funding opportunities. The Offices
release strategic plans, and the NIH triennial report to Congress describes
Office activities.

Opportunities for IC Collaboration

During the CSR Review Process

Independent  of  the  efforts  of  the ADCC  to  coordinate  autoimmune
disease research activities, ICs can take steps among themselves to coordi-
nate their research interests. The CSR review process, as noted earlier, pres-
ents an opportunity for ICs to collaborate on research activities, including
collaborating on research funding for autoimmune diseases. CSR reviews
all unsolicited grant applications and assigns them the appropriate IC for
funding  according  to  guidelines  the  ICs  provide  (Hodge,  2021).  Those
guidelines  direct  CSR  on  how  to  address  grant  applications  that  tackle
areas  of  shared  interest  for  multiple  ICs.  ICs  may  also  “bid”  to  be  part
of  grants  that  they  have  an  interest  in,  which  offers  an  opportunity  for
ICs to collaborate on studies that can leverage their mutual expertise and
resources.49 Since the committee did not have further access to materials
governing this process or additional details on the process, it is unclear
how well this process works and the frequency with which ICs bid on and
collaborate on projects.

Major NIH Initiatives Involving Collaboration

A number of recent and ongoing initiatives provide evidence of col-
laboration on autoimmune disease research across ICs as well as includ-
ing  other  federal  agencies  and  external  organizations  and  researchers.
Institute representatives, during their meetings with the committee, along
with information on IC websites, highlighted the major initiatives below.

studies  of  islet  transplantation  in  patients  with  type  1  diabetes.
Studies  conducted  by the CIT  Consortium  focus  on improving the
safety and  long-term  success  of  methods  for  transplanting islets,
the  insulin-producing cells  of  the  pancreas,  in people  whose  own
islets have been destroyed by the autoimmune process that char-
acterizes  type  1  diabetes.”

Principal areas of focus include:

	 “improving the isolation and viability of islets

	 reducing complications of the islet transplant procedure, (e.g.,

bleeding and clotting in the blood vessels of the liver)

	 reducing the side effects of immunosuppression
	 achieving good blood sugar control without hypoglycemia
	 following the fate of islets after transplantation and determin-

ing why donor islets sometimes fail

	 evaluating  new  ways  to  safely  prevent  immune  rejection  of

donor tissues.”

•	  Description:  TrialNet  is  an  international  network  of  researchers
exploring  ways  to  prevent,  delay,  and  reverse  the  progression
of  type  1  diabetes  (TrialNet,  2018).  TrialNet  was  established  in
response  to  the  Surgeon  General’s  Report  Healthy  People  2000,
which  identified  diabetes  as  a  national  health  objective  for  the
nation. In response to the report, Congress created the Diabetes
Research Working Group to develop a plan for diabetes research.
One of the group’s recommendations was to conduct additional
research studies and clinical trials on type 1 diabetes prevention.

SUMMARY

NIH is the primary funding agency for biomedical research, including
autoimmune disease research. In 2020, NIH spent more than $1 billion on
autoimmune disease research. Currently, 12 of 24 ICs provide the major-
ity of funding to support extramural investigator-initiated autoimmune
disease research, and 11 of 24 ICs provide funding to support intramural
autoimmune disease research programs. Each IC has a different mission,
and often has different research priorities and focuses on different auto-
immune  diseases  than  the  other  ICs.  The  autoimmune  disease  research
focus of each IC ranges across basic, translational, and clinical research,
and  sometimes  ICs  have  overlapping  missions  in  autoimmune  disease

research. These overlapping missions could impede the coordination of
autoimmune disease research programs.

The   committee   identified   evidence   of   attempts   to   coordinate   fund-
ing and  research  efforts,  but it was  difficult for the  committee  to  assess
the  effectiveness  of  these  efforts.  While  the  ADCC  continues  to  be  active
to date, the committee was unable to determine the extent to which the
ADCC’s activities contribute to setting research and funding priorities for
autoimmune  disease  research  at NIH.  The  lack of  standardization of  the
process  of  strategic  planning across  ICs  and  consistency in  the  release  of
strategic  plans  by individual ICs  has  important implications,  since  it may
pose  an obstacle  for  ICs  in  coordinating their  strategic  planning efforts,
and  subsequently,  their  funding  and  research  efforts  for  autoimmune
diseases.

Analysis of Institute and Center

Autoimmune Disease Research Activity

Both extramural and intramural autoimmune disease research occurs
across  the  various  Institutes,  Centers,  and  Offices  at  the  National  Insti-
tutes  of  Health  (NIH),  including  the  Office  of  the  Director  (OD).  As
noted in Chapter 5, total spending for autoimmune disease research was
$1,083,000,000 for fiscal year (FY) 2020 (NIH, 2020a), a 2.6 percent increase
from  FY  2019.  NIH’s  investment  in  autoimmune  disease  research  has
remained  constant  at  about  2.8  percent  of  its  total  obligations  between
2008 and 2020 (Figure 6-1).1,2

From  2015  to  2020,  total  NIH  obligations  increased  by  40  percent,
whereas  autoimmune  disease  spending  increased  by  approximately  34
percent.  Over  the  2008–2020  period,  NIH-funded  autoimmune  disease
research activities totaled approximately $11.7 billion. The highest levels
of spending on autoimmune disease occurred in 2009 and more recently
in 2020 (Figure 6-2).

As  noted  in  Chapter  5,  some  Institutes  and  Centers  (ICs)  have  a
greater  focus  on  autoimmune  diseases  tied  to  their  mission,  and  thus
there  is  considerable  variation  in  the  level  of  spending  on  autoimmune
disease  research  activities.  The  OD  also  contributes  funds  to  support
autoimmune disease research activities. Table 6-13 shows total Institute,
Center, and OD obligations, autoimmune disease spending, autoimmune

spending as a percentage of total obligations, and average spending over
the 2008–2020 period.

In 2020, the ICs with the highest level of spending on autoimmune
disease research were the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney  Diseases  (NIDDK),  National  Institute  of Allergy  and  Infectious
Diseases (NIAID), and National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal
and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). NIAMS autoimmune disease spending as a
percentage of actual total obligations was the highest at 23.6 percent, fol-
lowed by NIDDK (15.6 percent). Although NIAID had the third highest
level of autoimmune disease spending, it was only about 5 percent of its
total  obligations  in  FY 2020.  These  three  Institutes  also  had  the  highest
average spending on autoimmune disease research during the 2008–2020
period. In 2020, of the total $1,125,730,564 spent on autoimmune disease
research, NIDDK (30.8 percent), NIAID (24.7 percent) and NIAMS (13.1)
spending accounted for almost 70 percent of the total autoimmune disease
spending (Table 6-2).4

CHARACTERISTICS OF RESEARCH

ACTIVITIES SUPPORTED BY ICS

NIH uses 245 activity codes to characterize the funding mechanisms
it employs to fund diverse activities. The committee focused on a select
number  of  activity  codes  to  characterize  NIH- and  IC-funded  autoim-
mune disease research activities. The committee used RePORTER activity
code data to assess autoimmune disease research activities by extramural
research  (R  and  P  grants);  cooperative  agreements  (U  grants);  and  fel-
lowship, training, and training center activities (F, K, and T grants); and
intramural research activities (Z grants) (Table 6-3). Figure 6-3 provides
NIH autoimmune disease funding for R, U, and P grants for FY 2008–2020
and the average funding for these grants over that period.

Research project (R) grant funding for autoimmune disease research
was highest in 2020 and lowest in 2008 and during 2013–2016. Funding for
cooperative agreements (U) grants was greater than funding for research
program project and center grants (P) during FY 2008–2020. Funding for
cooperative  agreements  increased  from  2008  to  2017,  dropped  in  2018,
and began to rise again in 2019 and 2020. Funding for research programs
project and centers was slightly higher in 2009–2011 and remained con-
stant after 2011.

Training  grants  contribute  to  building  the  autoimmune  disease
research  workforce  and  to  advancing  research.  Table  6-45  shows  NIH
funding for fellowships (F), research career programs (K), and institutional

training programs (T). Research career program grants had higher levels
of funding throughout the entire period.

The  committee  examined  the  proportion  of  autoimmune  disease
spending  used  for  training  to  total  autoimmune  disease  spending  and
compared it to other Research, Condition, and Disease Categories (RCDC)
spending categories (Table 6-5). The comparison groups are chronic dis-
eases  and  are  more  common  in  women  or  have  a  similar  prevalence
between men and women (cardiovascular).

IC FUNDING OF GRANTS

To explore ICs’ use of grants to further autoimmune disease research,
the committee examined IC funding for research (R), cooperative agree-
ment (U), program project/center (P) and training (F, K, T) grants. Figure
6-4 and Figure 6-5 present funding of R grants categorized by ICs with
the largest research budgets and smaller research budgets.

For the purposes of this report, ICs are arranged in order by budget
level  and  have  been  separated  into  two  categories:  large  ICs  and  small
ICs. Large ICs have FY 2020 actual total obligations greater than $1 billion,
and small ICs have actual total obligations of less than $1 billion. Among
the  larger  ICs,  NIDDK  and  NIAID  had  the  highest  level  of  funding  for
R grants in FY 2020. NIDDK had the highest level of average autoimmune
disease research funding compared with the other ICs. Among the smaller
ICs, NIAMS had a significantly higher level of funding in 2020 and aver-
age of funding for 2008–2020 for R grants to support autoimmune disease
research  compared  to  other  small  ICs.  The  OD  spent  an  average  of  $10
million on autoimmune disease research grants, which was comparable
to the average funding spent by other smaller ICs.

U  grants  support  research  activities  that  NIH  considers  to  be  com-
plex and of high-priority research areas. Unlike independent investigator
R  grants,  U  grants  require  greater  involvement  from  NIH  program  or

scientific staff. Figures 6-6 and 6-7 show the level of funding for autoim-
mune disease U grants for large and small ICs.

Among the larger ICs (Figure 6-6), NIDDK had a significantly higher
level of funding for U grants for autoimmune disease research activities
in FY 2020 and over the FY 2008–2020 period. NIDDK funding levels for
U grants over the period and in FY 2020 were more than double that of
NIAID, the IC with the next level of U grant funding. Other large Institute
funding of U grants was less than $6 million in 2020. In FY 2020, NIAMS,
among the smaller ICs (Figure 6-7) had the highest level of funding for
U grants ($9 million). During the FY 2008–2020 period, NHGRI had the
highest average U grant funding level ($7 million).

P grants support large, multidisciplinary, and long-term research on
autoimmune disease. Figure 6-8 shows P grant funding levels of at least
$1 million by IC. NIAID and NIAMS had the highest funding levels for
P grants and were similar, although NIAID has a larger overall research
budget than NIAMS.

ICs can play an important role in supporting the research workforce
in  their  area  of  focus.  Funding  can  help  build  the  research  workforce
through fellowships (F), research career programs (K), and institutional
training  programs  (T)  grants,  in  addition  to  traditional  research  grants.
Table  6-6  shows  IC  funding  of  training  grants  that  support  the  autoim-
mune disease research workforce. In FY 2020, NIDDK, NIAID, and NHLBI
had the highest level of funding for F grants ($2.0 million, $814,000, and
$804,000 respectively). NIDDK also had the highest average funding of F
grants over the FY 2008–2020 period ($1.6 million).

Funding for K grants was higher than funding for F or T grants. In FY
2020, NIDDK had the highest level of funding of K grants ($11.3 million),
followed by NIAMS ($8.2 million). Over the FY 2008–2020 period, NIDDK
($9.8 million) and NIAMS ($7.9 million) had the highest level of average
funding  for  K  grants  compared  to  other  ICs.  The  committee  notes  that
OD funding for K grants was $1.1 million in FY 2020, which is more than
double than the average funding over the FY 2008–2020 period.

ICs other than NIAMS relied less on the T grant mechanism to sup-
port  training  of  autoimmune  disease  researchers.  In  FY  2020,  NIAMS
funded  $3.9  million  in  T  grants  with  an  average  funding  level  of  $4.2
million over the FY 2008–2020 period. NIAID, NIDDK, and OD used this
mechanism at a significantly lower funding level.

The  committee  reviewed  NIH  spending  on  autoimmune  disease
research by type of grant and type of research according to three catego-
ries:  intramural,  investigator-initiated,  and  solicited.  As  noted  earlier,
intramural research funding (Z) is for internal NIH investigator research
activities, and R grant funding is the most common independent research
grant mechanism. ICs use solicited research funding opportunities to sup-
port priority research areas. NIH communicates with the research com-
munity about these grant opportunities through a notice of special inter-
est, program announcement, request for application, request for proposal,
and other mechanisms. Figure 6-96  shows NIH funding for autoimmune
disease research for the average over the study period and FY 2020. Of
the  three  types  of  grants,  investigator-initiated  research  grants  received
greater  than  70  percent  of  the  funding,  however,  funding  for  each  type
of research in FY 2020 is higher than the average over the study period.
Table 6-7 shows funding of intramural, investigator-initiated, and solic-
ited grants by ICs.

Funding for intramural research was highest for NIAID and NIAMS
(about $34 million each) in FY 2020 (Table 6-7).7 NIAID and NIDDK had
the highest level of funding for investigator-initiated research ($187 mil-
lion  and  $185  million  respectively),  followed  by  NIAMS  ($86  million).
NIDDK had the highest level of average FY 2008–2020 funding ($127 mil-
lion per year). Of the ICs reviewed, NIDDK also had the highest level of
funding for solicited research grants. NIDDK solicited research funding
was 2.7 times higher than NIAID funding for this grant type.

Intramural research activities represent 17.3 percent of NIH funding
for  autoimmune  disease  research  in  FY  2020.  A  total  of  50  intramural
principal investigators conduct autoimmune disease research, which may
include basic, translational, and clinical studies. However, the committee
notes  that  there  is  a  relative  lack  of  intramural  principal  investigators
who  focus  on  epidemiology  and  autoimmune  diseases.  The  committee
searched  the  NIH  Intramural  Research  Program  database8  to  identify
principal  investigators  who  conduct  autoimmune  disease  research  and
principal  investigators  who  engage  in  epidemiology-focused  research
(N=121). There are three intramural principal investigators who conduct
research  that  overlaps  both  of  these  areas.  This  number  is  significantly
lower than the number of principal investigators in the NCI intramural

RESEARCH GRANTS BY AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

NIH  introduced  the  RCDC  in  2009  to  categorize  funded  research.
RCDC  categories  include  a  research  area,  specific  condition,  or  disease
area,  but  the  categories  are  not  exhaustive  or  mutually  exclusive  (NIH,
2021a). Funded research as reported in NIH RePORTER may have mul-
tiple RCDC disease spending categories depending on the scientific and
research  focus  of  the  project.  Furthermore,  diseases  or  conditions  that
do not have a specific RCDC spending category (diabetes mellitus type
1, antiphospholipid syndrome, Sjögren’s disease, celiac disease, autoim-
mune thyroid disease, primary biliary cholangitis) must be searched for
using “key terms,” including the name of the condition and all iterations

of  it  (e.g.,  names  roughly  equivalent  to  antiphospholipid  syndrome
include Hughes’ syndrome, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, etc.).

The committee was interested in examining trends in the number
of  grants  for  autoimmune  diseases  of  specific  interest  identified  in
Chapter  3.  These  diseases  include  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (IBD),
multiple  sclerosis,  type  1  diabetes,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  systemic  lupus
erythematous  (SLE),  Sjögren’s  disease,  psoriasis,  celiac  disease,  autoim-
mune  thyroid  disease,  antiphospholipid  syndrome  (APS),  and  primary
biliary cholangitis (PBC). Hashimoto’s disease and Grave’s disease were
combined into a single “autoimmune thyroid disease” category. In addi-
tion, grants that were not associated with the committee’s specific disease
categories  or  were  not  disease  specific  were  labeled  as  “other  autoim-
mune disease” throughout the analysis. RePORTER data includes funding
information  for  each  year  of  a  grant  (e.g.,  a  3-year  R01  grant  is  identi-
fied as three increments of funding); the committee aggregated funding
increments with the same grant number to represent one grant. In total,
the committee identified and aggregated 28,148 funding increments into
8,470 autoimmune disease grants.9  Figure 6-10 shows number of grants
by disease category for FY 2008–2020.

Of the autoimmune diseases the committee examined, the four dis-
eases with the greatest number of funded grants over the FY 2008–2020
period were other autoimmune diseases (31.0 percent), IBD (17.6 percent),
multiple sclerosis (16.4 percent) and type 1 diabetes (13.2 percent). Figure
6-11  shows  the  total  number  of  grants  by  disease  category  funded  by
year,  between  2008  and  2020.  The  number  of  IBD  and  type  1  diabetes
grants increased gradually over time; multiple sclerosis grants declined
after  2009.  The  number  of  other  specific  disease  grants  fluctuated  over
the period.

Autoimmune disease grants involved 98 distinct activity codes. Fig-
ure  6-12  shows  the  top  10  activity  codes.  Among  these,  R01  (35.9  per-
cent) and R21 (12.4 percent) accounted for the largest number of grants.
R01 grants are the standard investigator-initiated grants, and R21 grants
are research exploratory/developmental grants meant to encourage the
development of new research activities in specific program areas.

For R01 grants, other autoimmune disease (light purple) multiple scle-
rosis (dark purple), and IBD (yellow) were the most funded grants in FY
2020  (Figure  6-13).  The  number  of  grants  increased  for  about  half  of  the
disease categories after 2016. IBD grants increased steadily over the period.
Sjögren’s  disease,  psoriasis,  celiac  disease,  autoimmune  thyroid  disease,
APS, and PBC had fewer than 25 grants per year.

9Aggregated grants also include subprojects added to a parent project.

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Among  R01  research  grants,  non-competing  continuation  research
grants (R01-5) were the most funded (32.5 percent) followed by new R01-1
grants  (22.3  percent).  Figure  6-14  shows  the  number  of  non-competing
R01 grants by disease and Figure 6-15 shows new R01 grants by disease
for FY 2008–2020. Non-competing continuation grants for all disease cat-
egories  decreased  in  2016  as  a  result  of  an  administrative  accounting
change  (Figure  6-15).  There  were  no  clear  patterns  in  the  trends  in  the
number  of  new  R01  grants  funded  by  disease  categories  except  for  the
increase in IBD grants over the study period.

The committee also examined the ICs designated as the funding IC
for autoimmune disease grants (Figure 6-16). Among the top 10 funding
ICs, NIDDK, NIAID, and NIAMS funded the largest number of grants.

Figures 6-17 through 6-19 show trends in autoimmune diseases by the
top three funding ICs (NIDDK, NIAID, and NIAMS). Figure 6-17 shows
that among NIDDK-funded grants, the disease categories with the great-
est number of grants were IBD (yellow), type 1 diabetes (black), and other
autoimmune  disease  (light  purple).  Figure  6-18  shows  NIAID-funded

grants by disease. The top three disease categories with the most grants
were other autoimmune diseases (light purple), SLE (dark blue), and mul-
tiple  sclerosis  (dark  purple).  While  NIAID-funded  IBD  grants  (yellow)
seemed to increase steadily since 2011, SLE and multiple sclerosis grants
decreased in 2015 but have since increased. Figure 6-19 shows NIAMS-
funded grants by disease. The top three disease categories with the most
grants  were  rheumatoid  arthritis  (orange),  other  autoimmune  diseases
(light purple), and SLE (dark blue).

IC Collaboration on Research Funding Opportunities

ICs  can  take  steps  among  themselves  to  coordinate  their  research
interests and to leverage their mutual expertise and resources.10 One mea-
sure of collaboration is the degree to which ICs engage in joint funding of
specific autoimmune diseases research activities. To assess the level of col-
laboration among ICs, the committee examined co-funded autoimmune
disease  research  grants  for  FY  2008–2020.  To  accomplish  this,  the  com-
mittee used NIH RePORTER data to identify administrative ICs funding
autoimmune disease research grants and corresponding funding ICs that
contributed to the total cost of grants during this period.

All 14 ICs collaborated with other ICs11 to co-fund autoimmune dis-
ease research activities during the period. Among the large ICs, NIAID
(4.23), NHLBI (2.70), and NIDDK (2.62) had the largest average number
of joint IC funding collaborations (Table 6-8).12  These ICs jointly funded
research grants with one to six other ICs in a given year and collaborated
with  eight  to  nine  different  ICs  over  the  period.  NIDDK  collaborated
consistently with at least one IC each year and with up to six ICs during
a given year. Among the smaller ICs, NIAMS (3.4) had the highest aver-
age number of joint IC funding collaborations followed by NIDCR (1.10)
and NCATS (1.00). NIAMS collaborated with nine different ICs over the
period.  NIDCR  and  NCATS  collaborated  with  four  and  three  different
ICs  (respectively)  during  the  period.  Most  collaborations  were  on  P,  R,
and U grants.

RESEARCH FOCUS OF FUNDED GRANTS

The  statement  of  task  directed  the  committee  to  evaluate  the  NIH
research  portfolio  with  particular  attention  to  issues  such  as  risk  fac-
tors,  diagnostic  tools,  barriers  to  diagnoses,  treatments,  and  prospects  for
cures.   Given   the   enormity  of   the   task,   which   would   have   required   that
the committee review the 8,470 abstracts  associated  with the autoimmune
disease  grants  funded  from  2008  to  2020,  the  committee  found  three  ways
to   approach   the   task  in   a   more   efficient  and   manageable   way.   The   first
approach  used  research  topic  modeling,  a  type  of  statistical  modeling to
identify  popular  “topics”   that  appeared   in   the   abstracts.   In   the   second
approach,   committee   members   utilized   RCDC   spending  categories   and
RePORTER  data  to  determine  which particular  spending categories  were
co-occurring with the autoimmune disease spending category. In the third
approach,  the  committee  reviewed  a  sample  of  research  grant abstracts  to
identify the  primary focus  of  the  research.

The  committee,   with   the  aid  of   a  consultant,  used   latent  dirichlet
allocation   (LDA)   statistical   modeling  to   identify  research   topics   in  the
set of  8,470  NIH research  abstracts  related  to  autoimmune  disease  grants
funded between 2008 and 2020. Topic modeling using LDA  is a method of
fitting a  pre-determined  number  of  topics  to  a  set of  texts.  The  LDA  algo-
rithm  repeatedly selects  and  assigns  words  in  each document to  a  topic
and  assesses  the  “fit”  of  the  word  to  the  topic  by looking at what words
are frequently found together across the texts (Blei et al., 2003). In the past,
researchers  have  applied  LDA  modeling to  scientific  abstracts  to  analyze
funding patterns  and  trends  in  research (Park et al.,  2016;  Porturas  and
Taylor,  2021).  Based  on  the  coherence  score  of  words13 that tended to co-
occur  together  in  the  dataset,  30  topics  were  determined  to  be  the  optimal
number of topics that could be used to fit the data (words) in the abstracts
(Bittermann and Fischer, 2018; Park et al., 2016; Porturas and Taylor, 2021).
See  Appendix H  for  more  detailed  information.

One of the outputs of the LDA model is a matrix that shows the pro-
portion of topics assigned to each abstract. For example, 30 percent of the
words in an abstract might belong to topic 1, and 70 percent of words in
an abstract might belong to topic 2. The topic with the highest proportion
within each abstract was assigned to the abstract. Topics were combined

13 Coherence  score  is  a  score  that  calculates  whether  the  words  in  the  same  topic  make
sense when they are grouped together and is an indicator of the quality of the topics being
produced (Cristian, 2020).

based on similarity of words within topics. Box 6-1 shows the final list of
23 topics that fit the data the best.

Figures 6-20 through 6-23 show the frequency of these topic assign-
ments from 2008 to 2020. This graphic is a depiction of the popularity of
the research topics in the grants over the period. Trends over time show
that the research topics related to IBD, treatment/therapy, lung disease,
diagnostic [tools], and imaging have trended upward in contrast to ani-
mal  model,  genetics,  and  pathogenesis.  Compared  to  the  other  disease
focused  topics,  type  1  diabetes  was  prevalent  among  grants  over  time
(Figure 6-20). Cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular, and multiple
sclerosis remained consistent over the time period. In Figure 6-21, immune
response  (innate  immunity)  may  be  disproportionately  high  because  of
its relevance to various aspects of autoimmune disease research as well
as a lack of a concrete definition for innate immunity. Between 2008 and
2018,  the  mention  of  treatment/therapy  in  autoimmune  disease  grant
abstracts drastically increased, but then decreased sharply (Figure 6-22).
However, mention of disease progression, diagnostic, and imaging gener-
ally increased during the latter part of the decade. In Figure 6-23, centers/

core project funding was variable throughout the time period, and there
has been a consistent decrease in the mention of training being present in
autoimmune disease abstracts, especially between 2015 and 2020.

One of the downsides of using LDA for topic modeling is that the top-
ics must be discovered “latently” within the texts and cannot be inputted
into the model algorithm. In other words, this method cannot be used to
actively search for specific research topics.

RCDC Spending Categories

The  second  approach  the  committee  used  to  evaluate  the  NIH
research  portfolio  was  to  determine  which  other  NIH  RCDC  spending
categories  co-occur  with  the  autoimmune  disease  spending  category.
This can provide insight into themes within NIH’s autoimmune disease
research portfolio. The definitions of the categories include all aspects of
the topic, including basic, pre-clinical, clinical, biomedical, health services,
behavioral, and social research, as defined by NIH scientific experts (NIH,
2020a). However, the definitions are not publicized. Table 6-9 shows the
RCDC spending categories that the committee selected for analysis based
on  the  statement  of  task,  concepts,  or  conditions  known  to  be  related
to  autoimmune  disease,  and  affected  populations.  Out  of  the  25  RCDC
spending  categories  the  committee  analyzed,  Genetics  (32.1  percent),
Biotechnology  (23.4  percent),  Prevention  (22.9  percent),  Pediatric  (15.9
percent), and Women’s Health (12.9 percent) were the top five spending
categories co-occurring with the autoimmune disease spending category
in a total of 8,470 grants.

PICO Portal

PICO Portal is an online tool used to review and manually categorize
scientific literature. Given the large variation in the number of grants per
disease, the committee decided to take random, weighted samples of the
selected diseases as follows: a 10 percent sample of diseases with greater
than 1,000 grants (“other autoimmune disease,” IBD, multiple sclerosis,
type  1  diabetes,  rheumatoid  arthritis,  and  SLE),  a  50  percent  sample  of
diseases between 100 and 999 grants (Sjögren’s, psoriasis, and celiac dis-
ease), and a 100 percent sample of diseases with fewer than 99 grants APS
(autoimmune thyroid disease and PBC). This resulted in a total of 1,148
grants. Grants were then deduplicated (because a grant could have been
assigned to more than one disease), resulting in a total of 1,127 grants for
the committee to manually categorize. 1,127 is approximately 13 percent
of the total number of grants (N=8,470).

Research  characteristics  were  chosen  to  evaluate  the  portfolio  and
identify the focus of the research. These characteristics encompass various

concepts in the statement of task, co-morbid diseases or complications of
autoimmune  disease,  and  type  and  method  of  research.  Examining more
than  one  autoimmune  disease  aimed  to  capture  grants  exploring the  co-
occurrence of autoimmune diseases. Within PICO Portal, the committee
used  the  tagging feature  to  categorize  the  abstracts  with  one  or more  of
the   following  research  characteristics:   animal   model,   cancer,   cardiovas-
cular,   depression,   diagnostic,   environment/infectious   agents,   epidemi-
ology,  genetics,  nursing/behavioral  health  services,  pathophysiology/
mechanisms, pediatrics, primary prevention, treatment/therapy, in vivo
human  study,  in  vivo  animal  study,  in  vitro  study,  and  more  than  one
autoimmune disease. The committee predefined specific definitions of the
research  characteristics  in  order  to  tag abstracts  objectively.

Figures 6-24 and 6-25 show the number and percentage of abstracts
tagged with the research characteristics. More than half (59.1 percent) of
the 1,127 abstracts were tagged as having a focus on pathophysiology/
mechanisms, followed by genetics (25.3 percent), treatment/therapy (23.2
percent), and animal model (23.2 percent). “Animal model” refers to the
development of a new in vivo animal study for use to study autoimmune
disease, whereas “in vivo animal study” refers to the use of an already
existing  animal  model. Approximately  22  percent  of  the  abstracts  men-
tioned  or  focused  on  more  than  one  autoimmune  disease.  In  addition,
the  committee  tagged  abstracts  based  on  the  type  of  study  researchers
intended to conduct with their grant funding (Figure 6-25). Almost half
of  the  abstracts  were  identified  as  being  an  in  vivo  animal  study  (48.4
percent),  followed  by  in  vitro  (40.8  percent),  and  in  vivo  human  study
(29.3 percent).

It is important to note the discrepancy between the RCDC spending
category “prevention” and “primary prevention” as a predefined research
characteristic tag in PICO Portal. The committee defined primary preven-
tion, found in 1.3 percent of abstracts, as “research that focuses on pre-
venting an autoimmune disease from occurring in an individual,” and is
only  one  of  the  three  levels  of  prevention.  In  contrast,  almost  one-third
of autoimmune disease grants included the RCDC prevention category,
suggesting that RCDC may use a different definition that includes other
levels of prevention. Alternatively, depression as both an RCDC category
and a PICO Portal research characteristic tag both occurred infrequently
in  autoimmune  disease  grants  (0.5  percent).  This  points  to  a  potential
opportunity to explore depression as a disease that coincides with auto-
immune disease.

Study Section Analysis

Investigator-initiated  research  (R01)  grants  are  the  most  common
research grants funded (Figure 6-9). As noted in Chapter 5, study sections
review  applications  for  these  grants,  with  study  section  peer  reviewers
responsible  for  assigning  priority  scores  based  on  scientific  merit.  Peer
reviewers  draw  upon  their  expertise  in  investigating  line(s)  of  research
comparable  to  those  under  review  to  assign  scores  that  distinguish  the
very best applications from the weaker ones.

The committee used the NIH Center for Scientific Review (CSR) study
section search tool to analyze study sections that review R01 grant appli-
cations.14  As  many  as  100  different  study  sections  may  be  involved  in

14 The committee used the online CSR study section tool available at https://public.csr.
nih.gov/StudySections,  accessed  November  24,  2021.  The  committee  entered  the  name  of
each of the select autoimmune diseases of committee interest into the study section search
field to identify the names of its associated chartered study sections.

Only  chartered  study  sections  were  included  because  they  review  most  investigator-
initiated  research  grant  applications.  The  total  number  of  chartered  study  sections  for  all
select diseases (de-duplicated) was then tallied.

reviewing  unsolicited  investigator-initiated  research  grant  applications
focusing on the select autoimmune diseases the committee chose to exam-
ine. Given that such a large number of diverse study sections can poten-
tially review autoimmune disease grant applications, CSR should ensure
that  individual  study  section  rosters  include  the  appropriate  expertise,
including expertise for reviewing animal and human studies, to provide
the proper review of these applications.

Table 6-1015 provides a snapshot of data generated by the RePORTER
Matchmaker tool.  The  table shows study  sections—the  names of which
appear in the far left column—that reviewed funded grants focusing on
the autoimmune diseases of interest to the committee; the table reflects a
2-year period.16,17  The table identifies those study sections that reviewed
the most funded grants for each disease of focus according to a bar graph
RePORTER automatically generates to provide this information; the num-
ber of grants are indicated in the corresponding cells. One to three study
sections reviewed the majority of funded grants for the two years, sug-
gesting  that  this  more  limited  number  of  study  sections  has  the  correct
expertise for review of autoimmune disease grant applications. The com-
mittee notes that a more valuable analysis would have been to identify,
for a given period, the grant applications that were reviewed for the select
diseases  regardless  of  whether  they  were  approved.  This  would  have
provided a better baseline for analyzing patterns of review by the study
sections. However this information was not available. The most common
study sections responsible for the grant applications in this analysis were
Gastrointestinal  Mucosal  Pathobiology;  Hypersensitivity,  Autoimmune
and  Immune-Mediated  Diseases; Arthritis,  Connective  Tissue  and  Skin;
Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Science; Cellular and Molecular Immunol-
ogy  B;  Clinical  Neuroimmunology  and  Brain  Tumor;  Innate  Immunity
and Inflammation; Cellular and Molecular Biology of Glia; Clinical and
Integrative Diabetes and Obesity; Cellular Aspects of Obesity and Diabe-
tes; and Hepatobiliary Pathophysiology.

16 The   committee   used   the  RePORTER   Matchmaker   search   tool   available   at  https://re-
porter.nih.gov/matchmaker,  accessed  December  3,  2021.  The  committee  entered  the  name
of each of the select autoimmune diseases of committee interest into the field to yield the
number of projects associated with that disease. The user then activated the Active Projects
feature and selected 2019 and 2020 in the Fiscal Year dropdown. RePORTER then generated a
graph of the study sections that had reviewed the most grants for that autoimmune disease.
The  study  sections  appearing  in  the  graph,  and  the  number  of  grants  each  study  section
reviewed, constitute the data included in Table 6-8.

17 Data  of  this  nature  change  in  the  RePORTER  system  over  time.  For  its  analysis,  the
committee selected active projects; as projects conclude, they are no longer generated when
the “active” option is chosen.

NIH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH:

INDICATORS OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS

The statement of task directed the committee to include NIH accom-
plishments in its report. The committee addressed this task by conducting
a  high-level  review  of  a  number  of  activities  and  measures  that  reflect
progress in research (clinical trials and patents), and indicators of scien-
tific performance, quality, and influence on the research field (bibliometric
indicators). The committee describes the results of its examination below.

Clinical Trials

Results  of  biomedical  research  on  autoimmune  disease  can  yield
opportunities to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment of these
diseases.  Clinical  trials,  also  known  as  interventional  studies,  translate
basic  science  knowledge  for  use  in  clinical  care  (NLM,  2021a).  Clinical
trials  focus  on  developing,  testing,  and  implementing  diagnostics  and
therapeutics across a wide range of diseases and conditions to evaluate
the  effects  of  the  interventions  on  safety  and  health-related  outcomes
(NLM, 2021a). The committee examined clinical trial activity by autoim-
mune disease as one measure of research portfolio advancement.

The committee  obtained  clinical trial data  from  clinicaltrials.gov18 and
linked clinical trials to the grants associated with the committee’s autoim-
mune diseases of interest. Clinical trials were de-duplicated using their
Clinical Trial ID and included based on their relevance to the committee’s
specific diseases of interest and autoimmune disease as a broader category
(“other autoimmune disease”). Ultimately, the committee identified 353
autoimmune disease clinical trials between filing year 2008 and 2020. The
“other autoimmune disease” category represents approximately 27 per-
cent of the clinical trials. The remaining 73 percent were associated with
one or more autoimmune disease.

Figure 6-2619  shows the number of clinical trials by disease from fil-
ing  years  2008–2020.  The  top  five  autoimmune  disease  categories  with
the most clinical trials over the study period were type 1 diabetes (38.7
percent),  other  autoimmune  disease  (26.6  percent),  rheumatoid  arthritis
(10.3 percent), multiple sclerosis (5.8 percent), and IBD (5.5 percent). Each
of the remaining autoimmune diseases accounted for less than 5 percent
of clinical trials over this period. Clinical trials were fewer for the remain-
ing autoimmune diseases.

18Grants with an RCDC code for “Autoimmune Disease” obtained from NIH RePORTER
for Fiscal Year 2008 (October 1, 2008–September 30, 2008) through Fiscal Year 2020 (October
1, 2019–September 30, 2020).

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Out  of  the  353  clinical  trials  pertaining  to  autoimmune  disease,  20
are phase 4 clinical trials. A phase 4 clinical trial is a “phase of research
to describe clinical trials occurring after the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) has approved a drug for marketing. They include postmarket
requirement  and  commitment  studies  that  are  required  of  or  agreed  to
by the study sponsor, and gather additional information about a drug’s
safety, efficacy, or optimal use”(NLM, 2021a). Table 6-11 lists select phase
4 clinical trials.

Publications

The research community often looks to publication citations and other
bibliometric  measures  as  indicators  of  scientific  performance,  quality,
and  influence  on  a  research  field.  The  committee  selected  a  number  of
these measures to examine the performance of the autoimmune disease
research portfolio from 2008–2020. These indicators include the number
of publications associated with funded grants, relative citation ratio, and
journal impact factor.

The  committee  conducted  a  bibliometric  analysis  of  publications  in
PubMed associated with autoimmune disease-associated grant numbers
in an effort to characterize scientific productivity and impact. Figure 6-2720
shows publications by disease category per year. Of the autoimmune dis-
eases examined, the four diseases associated with the greatest number of
publications over the 2008–2020 period were other autoimmune disease

(27.7 percent), IBD (22.5 percent), type 1 diabetes (18.2 percent), and mul-
tiple sclerosis (16.1 percent).

Figure  6-2821  shows  the  trends  in  autoimmune  disease  publications.
Between publication year 2008 and 2020, other autoimmune disease publi-
cations (light purple) generally trended upward and had the most publica-
tions overall with an average of 3,398 per year. Publications associated with
IBD (yellow) had the greatest number of publications among the commit-
tee’s diseases of interest but appear to have peaked in 2014. Publications
associated with type 1 diabetes (black), multiple sclerosis (dark purple), and
SLE (light blue) have also trended downward.

The  Relative  Citation  Ratio  (RCR)  is  a  metric  developed  within  the
NIH  Office  of  Portfolio Analysis  (OPA).  RCR  “represents  the  field- and
time-normalized  citation  rate”  to  the  expected  citation  rate  based  upon
the article’s co-citation network of NIH-funded publications (Hutchins et
al., 2016; NIH, 2021d). A publication with an RCR of 1 means that it has
the  same  influence  as  the  average  article.  The  RCR  metric  can  be  used
to determine the allocation of research funding and the extent to which
NIH awardees “maintain high or low levels of influence on their respec-
tive fields of research” (Aksnes et al., 2019; Hutchins et al., 2016). RCR is
often  used  under  the  assumption  that  citations  are  a  proxy  for  quality;
however, articles can be cited for a variety of reasons and RCR does not
take the specific context of a citation into account (NIH Library, 2020). This
counters the argument that RCR, alone, is a measure of quality.

Table 6-1222 shows the publications with RCRs by disease. IBD publica-
tions had the highest average RCR of 3.029 and are therefore three times
as influential as the average article according to this metric. Although PBC
publications had the lowest average RCR of 1.894, they are still approxi-
mately twice as influential as the average article.

Journal impact factor (JIF) is “a measure of the frequency with which
the average article in a journal has been cited in a particular year and it
is used to measure the importance or rank of a journal by calculating the
times its articles are cited” (University of Illinois Chicago Library, 2016).
The  scientific  impact  of  an  individual  article  is  unrelated  to  the  impact
factor of a journal (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,
2021), and JIF is a measure of journal quality exclusively. In the context of
evaluating NIH’s autoimmune disease portfolio, the committee focused
on publications resulting from NIH-funded autoimmune disease research
and the quality of the journals in which they are published.

Figure 6-2923 shows average JIF for the 10 journals with the highest JIF
for all projects. Of the 159,416 autoimmune disease-related publications,

63 percent (101,199 of 159,416) had JIF data. The size of the bubble repre-
sents the number of publications in the journal, while the location of the
bubble on the y-axis shows the JIF relative to each other. Although Nature
(dark gray) published the most articles between 2008 and 2020, Chemical
Reviews (brown) has the highest JIF (43.9). In most fields, the impact factor
of 10 or greater is considered an excellent score while 3 is flagged as good
and the average score is less than 1 (SCI Journal, 2021).

Patents

A patent grants a property right to the inventor and prohibits others
from offering, selling, or importing that invention (USPTO, 2018). Patents
granted as a result of NIH-funded autoimmune disease research aim to
encourage and protect biomedical innovation and may serve as a proxy
for knowledge generation and translational value in the field (Kalutkie-
wicz  and  Ehman,  2014).  The  committee  examined  patents  and  patent
applications by autoimmune diseases.

The committee obtained patent data linked to the grants associated
with  the  committee’s  autoimmune  disease  of  interest  from  the  United

States  Patent and  Trademark Office  (USPTO)  at uspto.gov. A total of 4,113
patent applications and patents were associated with NIH grants fund-
ing research in autoimmune diseases, of which 60 percent (2,470 of 4,113)
were  patent  applications  and  40  percent  (1,643  of  4,113)  were  granted
applications  (patents).  All  were  included  in  the  analysis.  A  total  of  30
percent of the patents and patent applications were associated with only
one disease category. The remaining 70 percent were associated with more
than one disease category.

Figure  6-3024  shows  the  number  of  patent  applications  by  disease
for filing years 2008–2020. The top three autoimmune disease categories
with the most patent applications were other autoimmune disease (30.3
percent), multiple sclerosis (22.8 percent), and IBD (19.8 percent). Fewer
patent applications were filed for the remaining autoimmune diseases.

Figure  6-3125  shows  the  granted  patents  by  disease  for  filing  years
2008–2020. The top three disease categories with the most patents were
other autoimmune disease (29.1 percent), multiple sclerosis (22.7 percent),
and IBD (18.4 percent).

The ultimate outcome of clinical and biomedical research is an observ-
able impact on the health and wellbeing of individuals. This downstream
effect is a result of fundamental scientific knowledge “applied to develop
actionable interventions that are implemented to enhance health, lengthen
life, and reduce illness and disability” (NIH, 2014). Publications dissemi-
nated throughout the scientific community often report the outcomes of
clinical and biomedical research, and the number of publications result-
ing from autoimmune disease-related research is astounding, as seen by
the  thousands  of  relevant  autoimmune-related  publications  produced
between 2008 and 2020.

The committee was unable to perform a comprehensive assessment
of research accomplishments and successes and therefore was unable to
assess clinical and biomedical achievements as a measure of knowledge
in  the  field  beyond  quantifying  publications,  patents,  and  clinical  tri-
als.  Another  way  to  assess  achievements  is  to  determine  how  research
translates  into  clinical  care  and  treatment  of  individuals,  but  this  too  is
an immense undertaking. Instead, the committee provides a number of
illustrative  research  findings  associated  with  the  research  portfolio  that
have  the  potential  to  improve  the  health  and  healthcare  of  individuals
living with autoimmune diseases in Table 6-13.26

Research on Interferons Could
Identify Individuals with
Sjögren’s Disease Most Likely
to Respond to Treatment

Sjögren’s disease

Investigators have found that a high level of interferons
(IFNs, that is, proteins produced in the inflammatory
response to infections) to be associated with a more
severe form of Sjögren’s disease for more than 50 per-
cent of patients studied. This finding paves the way for
“precision-based medicine,” a customized treatment
approach which tailors health care based on a person’s
genes to those patients most likely to respond to certain
therapies, such as anti-IFN treatments. In addition, it
could improve the selection of for clinical trials. “Strati-
fication” of candidates is particularly important given
differences among patients with Sjögren’s disease. Such
heterogeneity complicates disease classification, assign-
ment of disease mechanism and selection of therapy
(Hall et al., 2015).

Immunomonitoring Can Pre-
dict Complications of Lupus
Pregnancies

Systemic lupus erythematosus

Unique “immune signatures” can identify pregnant
patients with SLE who could suffer such complications
as preeclampsia, high blood pressure and damage to
organ systems such as the liver and kidneys, which
endanger the mother, and death of a fetus as well as
issues with fetal growth and preterm delivery. Such
outcomes affect over one-fifth of SLE pregnancies.
Researchers concluded that immune signatures, more
accurate than clinical assessments, can predict the
development of preeclampsia and adverse outcomes
for the fetus. Their findings provide a framework for
developing treatments to reduce morbidity and mor-
tality complications in pregnant patients with lupus
(Hong et al., 2019).

Multiple sclerosis

Research which transplanted stem cells for treatment
of MS led to positive outcomes for patients with the
relapsing form of MS. Almost half of those in the study
remained free from neurological progression of the
disease five years after the transplant. Better outcomes
such as improvement in bone marrow and “resetting”
of the immune system are associated with such factors
for patients as younger age, fewer prior immunothera-
pies and not having reached high disability levels. For
researchers, such results justify a future clinical trial
on stem cell transplants for treating MS including an
evaluation of safety and efficacy against approved
therapies of high efficacy. Another trial could address
whether this therapy can reduce the progression of
disability in patients with a progressive form of MS
that is worsening neurological function from the onset
of symptoms without relapses or remissions (Muraro
et al., 2017).

Type 1 diabetes

Study of treatment with teplizumab found that this
immune system-modulating drug delayed the onset of
type 1 diabetes in high-risk but nondiabetic relatives
of patients with diabetes. The delay of progression to
type 1 diabetes is particularly important given that it
is the second most common disease of childhood after
asthma. At-risk children progress to type 1 diabetes
more rapidly than adults. Once this condition develops,
children can face such challenges as managing it on a
daily basis and those who are not treated face life-
threatening complications. Building on this study, next
steps include testing the long-term efficacy and safety
of teplizumab (Herold et al., 2019).

Artificial Pancreas System
Controls Diabetes in Children

Lung Diseases Such as Asthma
Increase the Risk of Rheuma-
toid Arthritis

A clinical trial at four U.S. pediatric centers found that
a new artificial pancreas system effectively manages
blood glucose in children as young as age six. The
artificial pancreas, also known as a “closed-loop con-
trol,” is an “all-in-one” diabetes management system
which tracks blood glucose levels and automatically
delivers insulin when needed. By replacing reliance on
fingerstick testing with delivery of insulin by multiple
daily injections (or pump controlled by the patient or
caregiver), this system can improve the quality of life
and disease management for youth (Breton et al., 2020).

Rheumatoid arthritis

Research has found that women with lung diseases
such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) have an increased risk of develop-
ing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is independent of
smoking which is a strong environmental risk factor for
the development of RA. Early detection of RA through
monitoring of such patients could mean lowering the
risk of long-term adverse consequences in the future
(Ford et al., 2020).

ment of Ulcerative Colitis in
Children

Because irritable bowel disease makes it difficult for
food nutrients to be absorbed, growth in children who
have ulcerative colitis (a type of IBD limited to the co-
lon) can be stunted due to malnutrition. The PROTECT
Study (Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric
Colitis Therapy) has examined responses to treatment
by children newly diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.
This study determined that the presence in the blood
of a biomarker called pANCA (Perinuclear anti-neu-
trophil cytoplasmic antibody) is associated with more
extensive resistance to therapy for this disease. These
are antibodies to a type of white blood cell called neu-
trophil. The identification of this biomarker indicates
its potential as a diagnostic tool for planning individual
treatments for children with this disease (Spencer et al.,
2018).

Identification of Unique Cel-
lular Signatures for Crohn’s
Disease Patients May Improve
Treatment in the Future

Clinical  benefits  of  certain  treatments  which  can  block
the inflammatory response in Crohn’s disease have not
worked for all patients and drug trials for patients with
IBD  have  had  limited  success  in  recent  decades.  As  a
result, radical measures such as surgical removal of af-
fected areas in the small intestine may be necessary.

Recent research identifies a distinctive combination of
cells in those people with Crohn’s disease who do not
respond to “anti-TNF” drugs. (TNF or tumor necrosis
factor refers to an inflammation causing protein in the
body.) Analysis of how the cells communicate with
each other showed that this particular cellular com-
bination does not rely solely upon the tumor necrosis
factor to maintain gut inflammation. This may explain
why TNF-blocking drugs are ineffective. This analysis
also identifies several other molecular targets for other
potential therapies that, if used in combination with
TNF-blocking drugs might be able to prevent inflam-
mation in people with Crohn’s disease who do not
respond to anti-TNF medications alone. Such enhanced
understanding of differences in cellular makeup can
shed light on the nature of Crohn’s disease and help
predict which treatments might be effective (Martin et
al., 2019).

SUMMARY

In reviewing NIH’s research portfolio on autoimmune diseases, the
committee  employed  a  general  framework  that  considered  the  inputs
(spending),  activities  (research  conducted),  and  outputs  (clinical  trials,
patents, and other indicators) of NIH’s investment in autoimmune disease
research.  Spending  on  autoimmune  diseases  as  a  percentage  of  overall
NIH obligations has remained at only 2.6 percent between 2013 and 2020.
This  is  in  marked  contrast  to  increases  seen  in  overall  NIH  obligations
during  the  same  time  period.  In  addition,  the  distribution  of  this  fund-
ing for autoimmune diseases indicates that certain ICs dominate overall
spending  on  research  and  training  and  the  types  of  research  activities
funded. NIH may need to reconsider the current strong focus on inves-
tigator-initiated  research  in  order  to  target  areas  of  high  priority  and
effectively address the long-term, complex, and heterogeneous nature of
autoimmune diseases.

Regarding  the  activities  conducted  under  funded  autoimmune  dis-
ease  research  grants,  the  multiple  methods  the  committee  used  yielded

INSTITUTE AND CENTER AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

409

useful information at different levels of specificity. However, metrics are
not available for evaluating the overall research portfolio for autoimmune
diseases.

The outputs of NIH’s investment in autoimmune disease research can
be measured in a variety of ways, including clinical trials (the translation
of research knowledge into interventions), publications, and the number
of patents associated with autoimmune disease research grants (an impor-
tant indicator of innovation). There is a greater percentage of clinical trials
from filing years 2008–2020 for such autoimmune diseases as type 1 dia-
betes, SLE, IBD, and rheumatoid arthritis, with a much smaller percentage
seen  for  other  autoimmune  diseases.  In  general,  the  knowledge  associ-
ated with existing research grants has been successfully disseminated to
the research community through publications in well-regarded scientific
journals. In terms of patent applications, filings occur primarily for some
autoimmune diseases with far fewer filings for others. In general, findings
related to research outputs suggest the need for a nuanced and in-depth
examination of why progress via clinical trials and patent filings does not
seem to have been made for certain autoimmune diseases.

Given  the  findings  of  Chapter  6,  the  committee  concludes  that  the
absence of an overarching strategic plan with concrete metrics makes it
difficult to assess the distribution of funding by IC or disease. The com-
mittee also concludes that the relatively small percentage of NIH funding
devoted to autoimmune disease research and how it is distributed could
be  a  significant  factor  in  hampering  scientific  progress  on  diseases  that
affect more than 23 million people.

Opportunities and Options for Enhancing

Autoimmune Disease Research at NIH

In this chapter the committee reviews its response to the statement of
task and highlights observations that form the basis for its consideration
of potential opportunities and options for enhancing autoimmune disease
research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Chapters 2 and 3 provide ample evidence that autoimmune diseases
exact a difficult toll and inflict severe burdens on the U.S. population, with
consequences  that  compromise  quality  of  life  for  those  afflicted.  Many
autoimmune  diseases  affect  women  predominantly,  and  the  incidence
and prevalence of these diseases appears to be rising in certain groups,
such as children and adolescents in the case of two of the most common
autoimmune  diseases,  namely  inflammatory  bowel  disease  and  type  1
diabetes. The burden of some autoimmune diseases is higher among spe-
cific minority racial and ethnic populations, which also contributes to the
importance of enhancing research in these areas.

As  described  in  Chapter  2,  the  committee  realized  that  it  faced  a
daunting task given definitional issues and the lack of basic data. It found
that autoimmunity and autoimmune disease are evolving and dynamic
areas  in  which  definitions  of  autoimmune  disease  and  the  number  of
diseases identified as such continue to evolve and change. Recent scien-
tific advances have blurred the definition of autoimmune disease, there
is  no  consensus  on  the  best  terms  or  methods  to  conceptualize  autoim-
mune  disease  to  meet  the  differing  views  and  purposes  of  basic  and
clinical  research,  and  there  is  no  consensus  regarding  the  number  of

413

414

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

autoimmune diseases. The committee could not identify a concerted NIH
effort addressing these issues.

A second challenge the committee faced was the lack of basic epide-
miologic data on the incidence and prevalence of autoimmune diseases.
There is no mandatory reporting system or national registry for autoim-
mune  diseases  in  the  United  States.  Existing  incidence  and  prevalence
data often come from other countries that have health care systems cover-
ing the entire population. In the United States, data are incomplete and
often  outdated,  which  can  limit  the  ability  to  assess  whether  progress
has been or is being made in reducing the burden of these diseases. The
committee could not identify a concerted NIH effort to improve the avail-
ability of population-level data on autoimmune disease.

The committee’s examination of 11 diseases illustrating the spectrum
of autoimmune diseases emphasizes the variation in what is known and
unknown about each disease. For example, gaps exist in the epidemiology
of most autoimmune diseases; basic molecular mechanisms are not clearly
elucidated for many autoimmune diseases; important questions remain
regarding  risk  factors  and  etiology  for  most  autoimmune  diseases;  and
diagnostic  tools  are  limited  or  lacking  for  some  autoimmune  diseases.
Further, there is tremendous variation in how diseases present, progress,
and  evolve,  which  complicates  diagnosis  and  treatment.  Autoimmune
diseases  can  be  treated;  treatment  is  aimed  at  reducing  symptoms  and
improving  function  and  quality  of  life,  but  for  some  autoimmune  dis-
eases, information is lacking on how best to target therapies to individu-
als.  Finally,  the  committee  found  limited  information  on  the  social  and
economic  impact  of  autoimmune  diseases  on  affected  individuals  and
their families.

Chapter  4  describes  commonalities  among  autoimmune  diseases.
These  commonalities  suggest  common  immune  pathways  among  some
diseases or groups of diseases, including the role of genetics, biologic sex,
and environmental exposures. Advances in technology allow researchers
to capture, manipulate, and optimize enormous quantities of data from
basic  and  clinical  research,  which  they  can  in  turn  use  to  form  hypoth-
eses. The committee believes these commonalities regarding shared gene
and immune pathways may provide additional and significant insights
that can further the development of treatments and therapies that could
benefit patients suffering with these diseases. For this area of inquiry to
advance,  a  multidisciplinary  approach  will  be  needed  that  draws  upon
the expertise of researchers from across NIH.

Chapter 5 describes the NIH research grant process and coordination
of autoimmune disease research. The committee found that the Autoim-
mune Disease Coordinating Committee (ADCC) has no dedicated fund-
ing  or  staff  and  functions  as  a  convener  of  Institutes  and  Centers  (ICs)

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

415

and external partners. It was unable to assess the extent to which ADCC
activities  have  expanded,  renewed  the  focus  on,  or  provided  enhanced
coordination of autoimmune disease research.

The committee reviewed the NIH research portfolio on autoimmune
disease with an appreciation of the research gaps highlighted in Chapters
2 through 4. The general framework for this review included, to the extent
possible,  reviewing  a  set  of  inputs,  activities,  and  outputs.  Among  the
inputs  reviewed  were  NIH  spending  for  autoimmune  disease  research
grants and procedures for awarding grants, as well a review of individual
IC missions and strategic plans. The committee found that there is no cen-
tral repository for information on autoimmune disease research activity
undertaken by ICs across NIH. Committee members reviewed IC strategic
plans, websites, and other information to obtain insights into the autoim-
mune disease research priorities of the ICs reviewed and to identify which
autoimmune diseases might be relevant to their missions. The committee
notes that the lack of a central repository for autoimmune disease research
at NIH hampers the ability of individuals in and outside of NIH, and in
and outside of the research enterprise, to readily access this information
and consequently limits transparency and communication with the public
and other stakeholders.

The  committee  found  that  NIH  spending  on  autoimmune  disease
research  has  remained  constant  at  about  2.8  percent  of  total  spending
between 2008 and 2020 while there are indications that some autoimmune
diseases are on the rise and that many individuals are living with autoim-
mune  disease.  If  resources  increase  for  autoimmune  disease  research,  a
strategy for prioritizing, leveraging, and assuring that funds are invested
in the areas of highest scientific priority would be essential. Similarly, if
budgets remain constrained, the need for strategic prioritization is even
greater. The committee did not find evidence of current crosscutting auto-
immune disease research budgeting, planning, or prioritization.

The  committee  next  reviewed  the  focus  of  the  funded  autoimmune
disease research grants as the statement of task requested. It used three
different approaches, which indicated significant variation in the focus of
research grants. This is consistent with the fact that 73 percent of autoim-
mune  disease  research  grants  are  investigator  initiated.  The  committee
notes that in the NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Category (RCDC)
analysis of co-occurring RCDC spending categories, autoimmune disease
relevant themes such as minority health, pain research, and co-occurring
complications, conditions, or diseases (e.g., chronic pain, cancer, cardio-
vascular  disease,  depression,  eye  disease  and  disorders)  co-occurred  in
less  than  10  percent  of  autoimmune  disease  grants.  Spending  category
themes  related  to  burden  of  illness,  caregiving,  and  health  services  co-
occurred in less than 2 percent of grants.

416

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

The analysis of the focus of autoimmune disease grants using differ-
ent  methods  provided  limited  information.  The  committee  had  no  basis
upon  which  to  determine  whether  (1)  the  funded  grants  represent  the
most  promising,  innovative,  or  impactful  autoimmune  disease  research
areas; (2) dollars are appropriately distributed by research topic area (e.g.,
crosscutting research, basic science, clinical science, specific autoimmune
diseases); and (3) fellowships, research career, and training program grants
appropriately support the development of a multidisciplinary and diverse
autoimmune disease research workforce. A crosscutting strategic plan to
guide current research activities with details on specific goals, objectives,
timelines,  and  milestones  would  have  provided  an  important  reference
point to guide the assessment of the current portfolio. Developed 20 years
ago, the last autoimmune disease research plan lacked such details.

Shared  immune  pathways  among  autoimmune  diseases  noted  ear-
lier suggest opportunities for cross-IC collaboration and coordination of
research activities. The committee’s analysis of IC collaborations on joint
research  funding  opportunities  from  2008  to  2020  indicates  an  average
of four or fewer IC collaborations during the period. Based on this find-
ing, the committee raises the question as to whether ICs can do more to
collaboratively  leverage  cross-NIH  expertise  and  resources  to  advance
autoimmune disease research activities.

Finally, the committee attempted to assess the output or accomplish-
ments  associated  with  funded  research  on  autoimmune  disease.  This
effort included a high-level examination of clinical trial activity represent-
ing  the  translation  of  research  knowledge  into  interventions  that  influ-
ence  health-related  biomedical  or  behavioral  outcomes.  Clinical  trials
have centered on certain autoimmune diseases but not for other diseases
that  receive  limited  funding,  perhaps  indicating  that  research  has  not
yet  progressed  to  this  stage.  The  committee  also  considered  a  number
of  bibliometric  indicators:  number  of  publications;  the  relative  citation
ratio, a research influence indicator; and the journal impact factor, which
indicates the quality of the journal that published the article. A final task
involved identification of the number of patents associated with autoim-
mune disease research grants as an indicator of innovation and the trans-
lational value of autoimmune disease research activities.

The  committee’s  review  of  the  NIH  autoimmune  disease  research
portfolio confirms that much extraordinary work related to autoimmune
disease has been undertaken and likely will continue. The committee was
struck  by  the  number  of  research  grants  (8,470)  it  identified  as  related
to autoimmune disease during the fiscal year 2008–2020 period and the
extent to which knowledge associated with these grants has been dissemi-
nated  to  the  research  community  through  publications,  translated  into

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

417

potential interventions, and driven innovation as indicated by approved
patents.

In  sum,  the  committee  found  that  autoimmune  diseases  impact  the
lives  of  millions  of  Americans.  Autoimmune  diseases  are  complex  and
share commonalities that would benefit from a coordinated, multidisci-
plinary research approach to better understand basic mechanisms, etiol-
ogy and risk factors, and to support the development of interventions to
mitigate the impact of autoimmune diseases and associated co-morbid-
ities  and  complications  across  the  lifespan.  Current  NIH  autoimmune
disease research efforts are guided by a dated research plan, and efforts
to  coordinate  autoimmune  disease  research  are  minimal.  Information
on  autoimmune  disease  research  activities  is  difficult  to  identify  across
ICs, and this hinders transparency and communication with internal and
external  stakeholders.  Finally,  the  committee  found  there  is  no  central
entity with capabilities to improve communication, management, priority
setting, and accountability for autoimmune disease research. The commit-
tee concludes that these findings can be usefully framed as future oppor-
tunities for enhancing the research enterprise for autoimmune diseases.

The  committee  offers  a  framework   of  five  essential  elements  to
enhance  the  rapid  advancement  and  improvement  in  autoimmune  dis-
ease  research—(1)  strategic   research  planning  to  set  priorities,  (2)  an
emphasis   on   coordinating  across   NIH  ICs   and   enhancing  collaborative
research  given  the  crosscutting  nature  of  autoimmune  disease,  (3)  an
orientation  toward  innovation,  (4)  a  focus  on  evaluating the  autoimmune
disease   research  portfolio   to   determine   progress   made   across   NIH,   and
(5)   resources   to   support  planning,   collaboration,   and   innovation.   These
critical elements, which can be viewed as complementary, are recognized
by  research  literature,  NIH  in  its  overall  strategic  plan,  and  the  find-
ings   of   this   study.   While   the   committee  recognizes   that  the   diffuse   and
investigator-initiated nature of NIH research, and of autoimmune disease
research in particular, has many well-described and accepted advantages,
this  approach does  not optimally promote  these  five  elements  given  bar-
riers   identified   by  the   committee.   While   several   individual   ICs   address
autoimmune  diseases  in  strategic  plans  and  may reference  elements  such
as  collaboration and  evaluation,  others  do  not.

Beyond  individual  ICs,  an  overarching  barrier  is  the  absence  of  an
overall strategic research plan for NIH work on autoimmune disease that
would prioritize coordination of and collaboration in research, act as an
impetus to increased innovation, and include attention to evaluation. The
ADCC has not developed a strategic research plan in this area since 2002,

418

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

and this plan did not have an evaluative component given the absence of
milestones or metrics. In contrast, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s
Disease,  another  area  of  crosscutting  attention  by  various  ICs,  lays  out
guiding principles, concrete goals as building blocks for transformation
that reference the importance of tracking progress, and related strategies
that identify lead agencies and potential research partners in the public
and private sectors (AIM, 2021; HHS, 2020).

In  the  area  of  autoimmune  disease  research,  a  relatively  indepen-
dent, structured, and ongoing examination of the research conducted can
identify where gaps and opportunities lie. This analysis can then inform
planning for how to address those gaps and opportunities most success-
fully, an effort that would also benefit from a detailed but not prescriptive
strategic plan. Currently, neither a rigorous evaluation nor planning for
autoimmune disease research across NIH occurs in an overarching, sus-
tained, and resourced fashion.

While  the  ADCC  was  tasked  to  coordinate  autoimmune  disease
research, the committee determined that it currently functions primarily
as  a  convener  of  ICs  and  external  partners.  While  meeting  participants
share  information  and  may  coordinate  their  activities  on  autoimmune
disease  research,  the  ADCC  does  not  have  central  responsibility  and
accountability  for  driving  activities  and  does  not  have  the  funding  to
spur targeted research by ICs.

During the course of this review, the committee identified an opportu-
nity not only for filling gaps that may fall between the work of diverse ICs,
but also, as discussed in Chapter 4, capturing and leveraging an under-
standing  of  the  crosscutting  nature  of  autoimmune  diseases,  including
their underlying common disease mechanisms, risk factors, and common-
alities such as coexisting illnesses. The committee believes that emerging
and evolving science now makes those connections more achievable than
ever before. Such information would doubtless serve as building blocks
for  and  would  accelerate  innovative  progress  toward  prevention,  treat-
ment, and cure.

Some  of  this  work  can  advance  without  the  infusion  of  major  new
resources.  However  the  committee  believes  that  any  centralized  entity,
to  be  effective,  will  require  new  resources,  and  that  a  broader  and  bet-
ter research enterprise on autoimmune disease has a greater potential to
bring relief to patients and their families.

The  committee  considered  five  options  for  enhancing  autoimmune
disease research and resulting outcomes: increased funding, two options
for coordinating research, establishing a national strategic plan, establish-
ing a new institute, and creating a special office for autoimmune disease
research. The committee recognizes that no one option will transform the
autoimmune  disease  research  enterprise,  and  that  each  option  involves

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

419

tradeoffs. Table 7-1 provides the committee’s description of each option,
noting advantages and disadvantages for each and offering a high-level
assessment of cost and political feasibility. As discussed below, the com-
mittee  found  that  the  best  option  for  addressing  these  challenges  and
opportunities would be creating an office of autoimmune disease in the
Office  of  the  Director  (OD)  that  is  funded  appropriately.  Such  an  office
would be positioned to respond to the committee’s concerns by:





Facilitating cross-NIH multidisciplinary collaboration and stimu-
lating innovation around autoimmune disease research;

	 Engaging in priority setting, strategic planning, and implemen-

tation;

	 Budgeting  for  and  allocating  available  autoimmune  disease

research funds in alignment with the strategic plan;

	 Managing and evaluating autoimmune disease research efforts;
	 Communicating with key stakeholders; and
	 Providing visible leadership on autoimmune disease research.

Option 1: Increased Funding for Autoimmune Disease Research

Given the flat line of research spending levels over the past 12 years,
the  committee  believes  that  increased  funding  will  be  an  indispensable
component of any effort to enhance autoimmune disease research oppor-
tunities,  and  thus  it  lists  that  option  first.  Options  for  use  of  increased
funding  include  directing  funding  to  certain  ICs,  such  as  those  whose
mission is more directly related to autoimmune disease issues of concern
(e.g., National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ,
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and National Insti-
tute  of  Arthritis  and  Musculoskeletal  and  Skin  Diseases)  or  increasing
funding to ICs that are highly relevant but less well funded (e.g., National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences). ICs with smaller total bud-
gets  would  have  more  funding  to  drive  and  solicit  specific  research  on
autoimmune disease and to bring more dollars and expertise to the table
to collaborate meaningfully. As a result, more and potentially better col-
laborations might occur.

The design of increased funding can include such options as a com-
mon fund or direction to certain focused activities. Funding for an “auto-
immune disease research common fund” could specifically support more
crosscutting  research  activities  that  could  foster  collaboration  among
ICs.  More  “risky”  or  expensive  but  high-payoff  research  collaborations
could  be  undertaken.  One  approach  would  be  to  model  such  a  fund
after  the  NIH  Common  Fund,  which  makes  funds  available  to  address
high-priority  emerging  scientific  opportunities  and  pressing  challenges

420

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

TABLE 7-1  Options for Enhancing NIH Autoimmune
Disease Research

Option 1. Increased Funding for Autoimmune Disease Research

Funding may
include:



Increased funding to certain ICs
Increased funding for crosscutting activities (autoimmune disease
research common fund)
Increased funding for certain focused activities

Pros: Potential
Benefits and
Advantages

•  Opportunity for accelerated discovery.
•  Specific ICs, particularly those that are highly relevant but less

well-funded, would have more funding to solicit specific research
on autoimmune disease and to “bring dollars and expertise to the
table” to collaborate meaningfully. Thus more and better collabora-
tions might occur.

•  More “risky” or expensive but high-payoff research collaborations


could be undertaken.
Increased funding for specific topics of research or workforce
development.

•  Relatively low administrative burden since it would leverage

mechanisms already in place.

•  Funding increases are uncertain/unpredictable, making planning

difficult.

Cons: Potential
Concerns and
Disadvantages

•  Unhelpful competition for limited new resources among ICs—and

among autoimmune diseases research areas.

•  Without major new funding, new investments in one area may be

offset by cuts in another.

•  There may be opposition to earmarking funding for autoimmune

disease research.

•  Funding may not address issues of coordination, prioritization, or

workforce development.

Costs

•  Variable but could be high

Feasibility

•  Contingent on internal NIH and external advocacy and substantial

congressional support.

Option 2. Enhanced Coordination Options

2a. Revitalize the ADCC

Pros: Potential
Benefits and
Advantages

•  Would not require creation of a new entity.
•  Possibility of drawing on past experience with 2002 Autoimmune

Disease Strategic Research Plan in developing a new strategic plan.

Cons: Potential
Concerns and
Disadvantages

•  Lacks IC neutrality by virtue of its placement within NIAID.
•  ADCC lacks resources to support ICs for credible implementation

of strategic plan.

•  Potential reluctance to significantly resource and empower an of-

fice that has not had a significant leadership role.

•  ADCC cannot hold ICs accountable for implementing or funding

research according to the strategic plan.

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

421

TABLE 7-1  Continued

Costs

•  Low

Feasibility

•  Easy but would require additional funding to support strategic

plan development.

2b. Establish a Health and Human Services (HHS) Autoimmune Disease Coordinating
Committee

Pros: Potential
Benefits and
Advantages

•  Would raise the visibility of autoimmune diseases to the cabinet

level.

•  Engages and potentially leverages other HHS agencies, including

their expertise, resources, and reach.

•  Could anticipate and inform issues—such as special populations
(racial and ethnic minority populations, women), payment for
health care services, regulation of drugs and devices, and public
health issues.

•  Could enhance engagement with non-HHS agencies, e.g., Social
Security Administration regarding disability determinations.

•  Greater accountability.

•  Downside of broad engagement can be greater bureaucracy (in-

Cons: Potential
Concerns and
Disadvantages

cluding neglect, and/or resistance), high-level products with little
depth, slowness, and lack of external support and politicization.
•  Would require creation of the body and need appropriate resources

(staff, funding, authority).

Costs

•  Moderate

Feasibility

•  Moderate difficulty: some resistance may be inevitable.

Option 3: Congressionally Mandated National Autoimmune Disease and
Autoimmunity Plan

Pros: Potential
Benefits and
Advantages

Cons: Potential
Concerns and
Disadvantages

•  Imprimatur of Congress brings weight, attention, expectation of

results, and likely resources to the issue.

•  Delineated activities and deliverables provide specificity and focus.

•  Focus on a single disease may obscure or inadvertently exclude

other conditions.

•  Absent specificity, accountability for results may be unclear or dif-

fuse.

Costs

•  Moderate

Feasibility

•  Would require Congressional action.

TABLE 7-1  Continued

Option 4: Create a New National Institute of Autoimmune Disease and Autoimmunity

Pros: Potential
Benefits and
Advantages

Cons: Potential
Concerns and
Disadvantages

•  Significantly elevates visibility and status of autoimmune disease
research within NIH and externally through leadership, infrastruc-
ture, and funding.

•  Provides sustained leadership and focus to autoimmune disease
research. Institute Director, staff, and their external advisers are
thinking and working full time on solving autoimmune disease
challenges through extramural, intramural, training, communica-
tion, and outreach activities.

•  De facto coordinating body that is crosscutting rather than autoim-

mune disease-specific.

•  Establishes clear focal point within NIH and externally. Internal
and external accountability and transparency for autoimmune
disease research may improve.

•  Requires time to conduct review and receive internal and external

input on the creation of a new Institute.

•  Substantial costs to administratively create and sustain; new appro-
priations would be needed to avoid reducing autoimmune disease
activities in other ICs.

•  Potential resistance from other Institutes.
•  Weak, underfunded Institute can give the illusion of increased

effort and thus can be worse than an admittedly diffused effort in
well-established but less focused ICs.

Costs

•  High

Feasibility

•  Substantial political obstacles can attend the creation of a new

Institute.

•  Requires congressional approval.

Option 5: Create an Office of Autoimmune Disease/Autoimmunity Research within
the Office of the Director of NIH

Realistically, the impact of such an Office will likely be proportionate to the
extent to which it has and controls resources. Thus two options for an Office
are described.

Pros: Potential
Benefits and
Advantages

•  Elevates visibility, provides sustained leadership, and establishes
a clear focal point for autoimmune disease research within NIH
and externally through extramural, intramural, training, and
communication and outreach activities.

•  De facto coordinating body that is crosscutting rather than

autoimmune disease specific.

•  Internal and external accountability and transparency for

autoimmune disease research may improve.

•  May provide, though to a lesser extent, many of the benefits of a

new Institute enumerated in Option 4, with fewer bureaucratic and
other costs or controversies.

•  Establishes direct linkage and interactions with NIH Director and

other Offices in the NIH OD.

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

423

TABLE 7-1  Continued

Cons: Potential
Concerns and
Disadvantages

•  Would require administrative resources in staffing and infrastruc-
ture to conduct strategic planning, cross-IC and cross-governmen-
tal collaboration, external communication and dissemination, and
stakeholder engagement.

Feasibility

•  More feasible than the creation of an Institute.

Option 5a. Create an Office with substantial control over NIH autoimmune disease
research and resources

Pros: Potential
Benefits and
Advantages


   Would have funding to stimulate new crosscutting and collabora-

tive autoimmune disease research and enhance workforce develop-
ment.

•   Would have accountability for funded research activities.

Costs

•  Moderate to High (in comparison to Option 5b)

Option 5b: Create an Office without substantial control of NIH autoimmune disease
research resources

Cons: Potential
Concerns and
Disadvantages

•  The Office would be accountable for its own activities but less so

for those controlling resources in other ICs.

Costs

•  Moderate

in  biomedical  research  that  no  single  NIH  IC  can  address  on  its  own.
Other options would be to model focused autoimmune disease research
activities  after  other  cross-NIH  activities  such  as  the  All  of  Us  Research
Program,1  an effort that seeks to advance individualized health care by
enrolling  1  million  or  more  participants  to  contribute  their  health  data
over  many  years,  or  the  Brain  Research  through Advancing  Innovative
Neurotechnologies  (BRAIN)  Initiative,  an  effort  that  seeks  to  advance
the  understanding  of  the  brain  though  development  and application  of
breakthrough neurotechnologies.2 Such initiatives, however, are generally
time-limited and are often focused or limited in topic or scope.

Increased  funding  directed  to  certain  focused  autoimmune  disease
research activities and initiatives is another alternative. Several focused
activities, such as the Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence (ACEs), Accel-
erating Medicines Partnership® (AMP®) Program including Autoimmune
and  Immune-Mediated  Diseases  (AMP®  AIM),  and  the  Immune  Toler-
ance Network  (Chapter 5) are examples of such focused research activ-
ities.  Funding  to  further  strengthen  the  autoimmune  disease  research

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

workforce is a focused activity deserving of additional funds. This could
be done with input and collaboration with autoimmune disease-specific
and professional societies.

Advantages to increasing funding include a relatively low adminis-
trative burden since they would leverage existing mechanisms. Disadvan-
tages  include  the  uncertainty  and  unpredictability  of  funding  increases
that  compromises  systematic  planning  for  research.  Funding  increases
would be highly contingent on successful advocacy within and outside
of NIH, as well as substantial Congressional support.

In addition, in the case of limited new resources, there may be opposi-
tion to earmarking funding for autoimmune disease research, and there
may  be  unhelpful  competition  among  ICs  and  in  autoimmune  disease
research areas. New investments in one area of research may be offset by
cuts in another. If funding is not used for collaborative research activities,
siloing  of  research  could  be  accentuated  further.  Given  these  consider-
ations,  the  committee  notes  that  funding  by  itself  is  necessary  but  not
sufficient for enhancing the research enterprise for autoimmune diseases;
it  does  not  address  issues  of  coordination,  prioritization,  or  workforce
development.

Option 2a: Coordination by Revitalizing the ADCC

The ADCC,  NIH’s  current  coordinating  mechanism  for  research  on
autoimmune diseases, was most active between 1998 and 2005, when it
produced  reports  summarizing the  state  of  autoimmune  disease  research
and  funding (2000),  an  autoimmune  disease  research plan (2002),  and  a
report  on progress made in autoimmune disease research (2005). The com-
mittee did  not identify an implementation  plan for the  2005  research plan
consisting  of   goals,   strategies,   and   milestones.   Since   2005,   reporting  to
Congress  on  general  progress  made  on  autoimmune  disease  research has
diminished, while the field  of autoimmune disease  research has  expanded
and   become   more   complex.   The   last  triennial   report  to   Congress   (2016-
2018)  provides  information on  highlights  of  specific  research  findings  in
the  areas  of understanding the  biology of  autoimmune  disease,  autoim-
mune  diseases  and  pregnancy,  and  successes  in  improving  screening,
diagnosis,  and  treatment.

Currently,   resources   supporting  the   ADCC   are   limited   to   two   staff
members   from   NIAID   who   carry  out  ADCC   activities   as   part  of  their
general   work  responsibilities.   In   addition,   there   is   no   specific   funding
dedicated  to  ADCC  activities.  Based  on  public  records,  the  ADCC  held
one  public  meeting in  2019  and  2020.

Among the advantages of revitalizing the ADCC is that it would not
require creating a new entity or developing new relationships within NIH

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

425

or  with  external  stakeholders.  The  experiences  gained  from  developing
the 2002 research plan can be applied to developing a new, more robust
strategic research and implementation plan. A potential disadvantage to
revitalizing the ADCC is that it lacks IC neutrality by virtue of its place-
ment  within  NIAID.  The  ADCC  also  lacks  authority  and  resources  to
direct or to support the ICs in implementing research associated with a
new strategic research and implementation plan. Not only would addi-
tional resources be required, but there may be internal reluctance to sig-
nificantly resource and empower a more robust ADCC.

Option 2b: Coordination by Creating an HHS

Autoimmune Disease Coordinating Committee

One alternative that the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS)  has  used  for  complex  and  crosscutting  issues  is  to  elevate  these
issues beyond NIH or other HHS operating divisions. This can be done
in multiple ways, including by creating an ad hoc committee, an internal
coordinating committee, or an advisory committee at the level of the Sec-
retary.  The  committee  envisions  such  a  committee  as  an  HHS  advisory
body designed to convene, share, and potentially develop new strategies
to tackle this complex problem. Such a body, located within the Office of
the Secretary, would help assure that autoimmune disease research and
translation to detection, prevention, and care receive deserved attention
at NIH and across HHS units, and that these efforts would fully leverage
the capabilities of sister agencies.

NIH’s participation in a well-run HHS ADCC would allow NIH ICs
to be informed on critical ancillary and often practical real-world issues
related  to  autoimmune  disease  that  could  be  tackled  through  research.
These  might  include  the  needs  of  special  populations,  including  older
people, people with disabilities, and racial and ethnic populations. Agen-
cies  such  as  the Agency  for  Healthcare  Research  and  Quality  (AHRQ),
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services (CMS), Health Resources and Services Administra-
tion (HRSA), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administra-
tion (SAMHSA), as well as the Administration on Aging and the Indian
Health Service would have specific expertise in these areas. CDC could
provide  perspectives  on  public  health  dimensions  of  autoimmune  dis-
ease. CMS and HRSA could provide expertise on health care issues, and
the Food and Drug Administration could advise on regulation and drug
approval. SAMHSA could be informed and benefit from NIH research on
co-occurring  mental  health  issues  related  to  autoimmune  diseases  and
could provide information on potential areas needing NIH research. An
added benefit of elevating this issue to the cabinet level is that it would

426

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

ease and enhance engagement with non-HHS agencies such as the Social
Security Administration  on  disability  determinations  issues  that  people
with autoimmune disease may confront.

While dramatic new policymaking or bold research initiatives might
not  emerge  from  the  work  of  a  cabinet-level  crosscutting  committee,
important exchanges of information could benefit both the NIH research
community  and  sister  agencies.  One  could  also  presume  that  affected
individuals and advocacy groups would gain a broader appreciation of
these issues through public meetings and other communication efforts.

On the other hand, creating a new crosscutting HHS ADCC can come
with  costs,  added  burdens,  and  frustrations.  The  downside  of  broad
engagement can be skepticism and the risk of a superficial, rote, or disen-
gaged response. Discussion can lack depth, nuance, or perceived immedi-
ate relevance. Cabinet-level engagement also risks politicizing scientific
issues.  A  well-run  HHS  ADCC  would  also  require  staff,  funding,  and
some authority, all of which might be perceived as better spent directly
on  NIH  coordination  including  enhanced  research  to  fill  critical  gaps.
While  the  committee  believes  NIH  would  benefit  from  engaging  more
with  sister  agencies,  it  may  be  that  there  are  less  formalized  and  more
issue-specific ways of doing this than the creation of a new HHS body.

Option 3: Develop a Congressionally Mandated National
Autoimmune Disease/Autoimmunity Research Plan

The committee considered and believes that there may be significant
value  in  a  congressionally  mandated  National  Autoimmune  Disease/
Autoimmunity Research Plan that could be sited in any one of a number
of organizational entities. There is useful precedent for such a plan, per-
haps most notably the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease (AIM,
2021). NIH is an active participant in providing input to and implement-
ing the National Plan. Through the AD+ADRD Research Implementation
Milestones  database,3  NIH  describes  its Alzheimer’s  research  efforts  in
response to the National Plan’s research framework, detailing specific steps
and success criteria toward achieving the National Plan’s goals. The mile-
stones also note funding initiatives, accomplishments, and highlights of
progress toward accomplishing the National Plan goals. Congress receives
an annual report updating the progress made toward achieving National
Plan goals (HHS, 2020).

While  no  analogy  between  diseases  or  the  state  of  research  for  two
conditions  is  ever  perfect,  there  are  similarities  between  Alzheimer’s
and  certain  autoimmune  diseases  in  terms  of  the  significant  numbers

3 Available  at https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/milestones.

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

427

of  individuals  affected.  For  example,  the  estimated  number  of  affected
individuals  living  with Alzheimer’s  disease  is  5.1  million  (HHS,  2020),
compared with an estimated 14.7 to 23.5 million individuals living with
at least one autoimmune disease (NIH, 2005). Yet, understanding of both
Alzheimer’s  disease  and  autoimmune  disease  conditions  is  limited.  In
some  cases,  research  is  in  its  infancy,  treatments  are  limited,  and  there
are  no  cures.  Most  importantly,  no  overall  architecture  for Alzheimer’s
disease research existed before developing the National Plan, and one does
not exist for autoimmune disease research.

The  committee  believes  that  Congress  would  have  to  take  specific
actions for such a plan to yield results. First, those individuals assembling
the plan would have to review this committee’s and other efforts in order
to describe and fully analyze the research portfolio and identify strengths,
challenges, and gaps. Second, those assembling the plan would have to
devise a process for assembling and executing a plan. This process would
involve  consulting  with  internal  and  independent  experts  from  diverse
fields,  providing  substantial  opportunities  for  public  engagement  and
input, providing regular detailed updates on progress, and convening one
or more summits. But most importantly, it would set specific priorities,
detailed objectives within those priorities, metrics for evaluating progress,
and milestones. Progress reporting would go beyond merely cataloging
substantial  scientific  advances  in  response  to  plan  goals  and  objectives.
Rather, it would include detailed descriptions of advances that scientists,
stakeholders, and other lay people could understand and contextualize.
There are several advantages to a properly conceived and executed
plan. First, it brings the imprimatur of Congress, which in turns brings
weight, attention, expectation of results, and likely resources. Those fund-
ing, overseeing, and otherwise taking a special interest in NIH autoim-
mune  disease  research  would  have  a  specific  stake  in  achieving  certain
concrete objectives and outcomes. Moreover, they and other stakeholders
would be able to see, and in the case of the public, participate in a process
for developing a plan and monitoring its progress and outcomes.

Second, the process would almost certainly enhance communication,
coordination,  and  collaboration,  both  by  virtue  of  the  process  and  by
what it generates. Third, the process would involve a creative review of
alternative research paradigms for accelerated progress. These paradigms
might suggest new ways of doing business or meta-projects. Fourth, and
relatedly, the process of developing a plan might well stimulate research-
ers  to  propose,  examine,  and  receive  funding  for  new  lines  of  research.
Fifth, it might provide a sense of hope to sufferers and their families that
progress  is  being  made  in  a  structured  and  measurable  manner.  Efforts
that engage the public and offer real transparency often have the ancillary

428

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

benefit of demystifying the scientific enterprise and building confidence
in the endeavor.

This  option  is  not  without  potential  disadvantages.  If  not  properly
structured,  progress  can  give  way  to  process. A plan  can  raise  expecta-
tions unreasonably, and focusing on predetermined goals and objectives
might  cause  leaders  and  researchers  to  be  less  attentive  to  complemen-
tary  relevant  science  and  research  that  is  happening  peripherally  or  in
other domains. NIH’s default and highly successful modus operandi, and
its remarkable results, often rest more on investigator-initiated research
rather than top-down research.

Option 4: Create a New National Institute of

Autoimmune Disease and Autoimmunity Research

The  general  mission  of  ICs  is  to  support  NIH’s  overall  mission  “to
seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living sys-
tems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen
life,  and  reduce  illness  and  disability.”  ICs  also  support  the  training  of
basic and clinical scientists to carry out research and disseminate informa-
tion on research progress to the public.

The  committee  considered  the  creation  of  a  new  National  Institute
of  Autoimmune  Disease  and  Autoimmunity  Research  (NIADAR)  that
would  support  and  drive  innovative,  crosscutting  autoimmune  disease
and  autoimmunity  research  through  intramural  and  extramural  pro-
grams,  as  well  as  promote  and  support  the  training  of  an  autoimmune
disease workforce. Such an Institute would have significant advantages.
A new Institute would likely elevate the visibility and status of autoim-
mune disease within NIH and externally, and it would assure a high-level,
constant,  broad,  and  detailed  focus  on  autoimmune  disease  research.
NIADAR  would  establish  a  clear  focal  point  for  autoimmune  disease
research for individuals within NIH and for external constituencies. The
Institute would function as a clear and empowered convener, coordinator,
and accountable focal point for autoimmune disease and autoimmunity
research.

To a greater extent than other options considered by the committee,
certain critical success factors would need to be addressed for this effort to
succeed. A new but underfunded, undefined, weak, or neglected Institute
is less desirable than a somewhat diffused effort in well-established and
highly functioning ICs. Even if those factors were overcome, establishing
a  new  Institute  would  come  with  a  number  of  disadvantages.  Creating
a  new  Institute  is  by  definition  administratively  daunting  and  would
require congressional action. Creating a new Institute would also require
a long-term view and patience, neither of which may hold appeal to those

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

429

anxious  for  progress.  Thus,  creating  a  new  Institute  comes  with  high
transaction and opportunity costs, and it could initially increase duplica-
tion of effort and even distract from productive research efforts. It might
even cause confusion during an initial period of transition.

While  reorganizations  can  bring  key  people  together  “under  one
roof,”  they  inevitably  dislocate  key  people  as  well.  Moreover,  creating
new units could engender resistance and resentment from existing enti-
ties,  neither  of  which  advances  the  research  enterprise.  Finally,  creat-
ing a new Institute risks unrealistically raising expectations about focus,
resources, and research outcomes.

Option 5: Create an Office of Autoimmune Disease/Autoimmunity

Research within the Office of the Director of NIH

The committee carefully considered the option of creating an Office
of Autoimmune Disease/Autoimmunity Research (OAD/AR) within the
OD. The committee found significant merit in this option, provided NIH
pursued this option in a way in that would likely succeed. This option is
not a new one and was proposed in a bill advanced by then Senator Joe
Biden in 1999. The committee found that the 1999 bill addressed several
concerns that the committee had raised in its deliberations including the
need for a central entity to: promote coordination and cooperation among
ICs and other entities, develop an agenda for conducting and supporting
autoimmune disease research, promote the appropriate allocation of NIH
for autoimmune disease research, report on research activities and iden-
tify future research opportunities, and provide leadership on autoimmune
disease to HHS, the NIH Director and other relevant agencies.

As governmental units at NIH and elsewhere persuasively argue to
Congress, the impact of a research organization is likely to correlate with
the  extent  to  which  it  owns  and  controls  resources.  This  is  particularly
true in the case of new entities advising on and negotiating the activities
of multiple actors who are already resourced. Given this, the committee
considered two configurations for OAD/AR. In the first, OAD/AR would
have its own research budget and it would substantially control certain
key  budgetary  decisions  about  autoimmune  disease  research  activities
conducted elsewhere in NIH, the Office of AIDS Research (OAR) serves
as a model for this configuration. In the second configuration, while the
Office would have certain responsibilities, it would receive only modest
or limited resources or authority to carry them out; the Office of Research
on Women’s Health serves as a model for this configuration. The commit-
tee  recommends  the  former,  fully  recognizing  that  budgetary  control  is
among the most sensitive issues within any organization. The committee
recognizes that this effort might need to strike some middle ground.

430

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Success will also depend on tailoring OAD/AR to specific and man-
ageable  objectives.  Furthermore,  a  successful  crosscutting  office  needs
the capacity to suggest and advance creative new scientific approaches,
partners, and paradigms. While effective offices recognize the importance
of living within institutional cultures and constraints, they can still sug-
gest and direct new ways of doing business that others may not see, have
the time or expertise to consider, or the resources to carry out. This, in the
committee’s view, is how a new OAD/AR within the OD would provide
its greatest value.

As  noted  above,  the  committee  believes  successfully  implementing
any option will depend on careful attention to budget considerations and
a  variety  of  other  factors  critical  to  success—a  substantive  and  serious
focus,  a  clearly  defined  strategic  vision,  and  a  well-considered  level  of
support for funding and staff. Absent such determinants of success, the
committee believes the creation of such an Office would not be a fruitful
effort. Because NIH is an institution with world-class expertise, billions of
dollars in resources, and extraordinarily high standards, no one benefits
when a new organization is created that does not meet those standards. In
arriving at this conclusion, the Committee has considered various organi-
zational models for creating an office meeting such standards by examin-
ing other Offices within the OD. Based on these reviews, the Committee
concludes that OAR can provide a highly desirable model for a new Office
of  Autoimmune  Disease/Autoimmunity  Research.  This  organizational
model has provided such important elements for coordinating HIV and
HIV-related research through:

•	  Advice provided to the Director of NIH, HHS, and other entities

on HIV and HIV-related research;

	 Establishment of research priorities/goals;
	 Development and annual evaluation of a strategic plan for HIV


and HIV-related research throughout NIH;

	 Assurance that funds are invested in the areas of scientific priority




and such funding is allocated;

	 Oversight,  coordination,  and  management  of  HIV  and  HIV-
related research (scientific, budgetary, legislative, and policy) in
collaboration  with  other  NIH  entities  (ICs  participate  in  Office
advisory bodies);

	 Convening stakeholders, encouraging collaboration and catalyz-
ing  innovation  to address emerging  scientific and public health
challenges; and
Including attention to workforce development in strategic goals
for HIV and HIV-related research.

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

431

Such activities in OAR have led to advances in HIV and HIV-related
research  ranging  from  prevention  of  HIV  through  a  long-acting  inject-
able  (incabotegravir)  and  risk  reduction  for  HIV  infection  via  use  of  a
microbicide (dapivirine) in an intravaginal ring (Office of AIDS Research,
2021). As  a  central  coordinating  Office  it  has  been  uniquely  situated  to
handle emerging trends and challenges such as the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-
19  pandemic  by  applying  knowledge  from  HIV  science.  From  2016  to
2021, the NIH HIV research program identified and communicated how
HIV research could contribute to an understanding of the COVID-19 pan-
demic and considered mitigation strategies to assure that the conduct of
HIV research would not be negatively affected by the COVID-19 experi-
ence. As another example, when SARS CoV-2/COVID-19 emerged, OAR
employed internal and external partnerships to develop and disseminate
clinical  guidelines  addressing  COVID-19  and  HIV.  OAR  capitalized  on
the HIV/AIDS Trials Networks to support the pursuit of promising pre-
vention  and  treatment  approaches  for  COVID-19  through  clinical  trials
(Office of AIDS Research, 2021).

In  the  area  of  workforce  development,  OAR  and  ICs  launched  an
initiative  for  inclusion  of  women  and  underrepresented  populations  in
the HIV research workforce of the future (Office of AIDS Research, 2021).
Using OAR as a model, the committee believes that a well-configured
OAD/AR could be an essential ingredient in further stimulating promis-
ing  and  impactful  autoimmune  disease  and  autoimmunity  research  at
NIH that can be translated into clinical practices that will prevent auto-
immune  disease  or  improve  the  lives  of  those  living  with  autoimmune
disease.

The Committee envisions the following responsibilities for the Office:
	 The Office would devise a process for and lead the collaborative
development of a Strategic Plan to address opportunities and gaps
in scientific knowledge. This would result in an NIH Strategic Plan
for  Autoimmune  Disease  and  Autoimmunity  Related  Research.  The
plan would:

	 Establish  both  a  high-level  blueprint  and  a  more  detailed

research agenda.

	 Set  both  high-level  national  priorities  and  detailed  disease-

specific and crosscutting priorities.

	 Describe  a  detailed  research  program  and  implementation



plan for carrying out that agenda.


	 Work with ICs to identify and promote research opportunities
that  align  with  strategic  plan  goals  (e.g.,  developing  solic-
ited requests for applications (RFAs) for crosscutting research
grants, promoting Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)

432

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

and  Small  Business  Technology  Transfer  (STTR)  Programs
grants).

5.	  Address autoimmune disease research workforce and train-

ing issues, including diversity of the workforce.

	 Provide  metrics  for  evaluating  progress  and  a  process  for

applying those metrics.

	 Examine  scientific  and  organizational  barriers  to  break-



throughs and potential solutions.

In  developing  and  implementing  the  strategic  plan,  the  Office
would  actively  seek  the  collaboration  and  engagement  of  IC
intramural and extramural investigators and other stakeholders.
This  outreach  would  serve  to  catalyze  innovation  and  identify
emerging areas of research opportunity. Strengthening outreach
could also inform funding for other important research priorities
undertaken by various ICs.

In  support of  strategic  planning,  the  Office,  in  collaboration  with
ICs and other stakeholders, should develop a consensus vocabu-
lary  that  includes   both   clinically  defined   autoimmune   diseases
and autoimmune mechanisms and a list of autoimmune diseases.
Such a definition and list of diseases is critical to improve research
and   data  collection  and   to   guide  patient  care  and   coordinate
communication.  Periodic  reassessment of  the  definition  and  list-
ing of  autoimmune  diseases,  should  be  undertaken  based  upon
emerging data.


	 The Office would ensure that funds are invested in the areas of

highest scientific priority. The Office would:

	 Engage in developing detailed autoimmune disease research

budgets.
Set budgetary priorities and attempt to align available dollars.
3.	  With  its  own  resources,  fund  certain  autoimmune  disease
research activities including those that are crosscutting, high
risk/reward,  relevant  to  special  populations,  and  related  to
workforce development.


	 The  Office  would  provide  scientific  coordination  and  manage-

ment of the research program. This would include:

	 Serving  as  a  focal  point  for  external  parties  seeking  infor-
mation or providing input on autoimmune disease research
opportunities at NIH.


	 Serving as a convener for emerging and crosscutting science
on  autoimmune  disease.  Collaborating  with  organizations

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

433

focused  on  persons-centered  research,  such  as  the  Patient-
Centered Outcomes Research Institute, and other stakehold-
ers, including industry, disease organizations, patient advo-
cates, and patients and their families in priority setting and
research design.

	 Stimulating  novel  approaches  to  autoimmune  disease


research.


	 Leveraging existing efforts and develop synergies across mul-




tiple Institutes, Centers, and scientific disciplines.

	 Coordinating with the Center for Scientific Review to review
assignment  guidelines  to  ensure  that  autoimmune  diseases
grants  are  assigned  to  the  appropriate  study  sections  with
optimal  representation  of  experts  and  expertise,  including
expertise for reviewing basic science (i.e., tissue culture, ani-
mal, translational) and human studies, and evaluate assign-
ment guidelines on an ongoing basis.

	 Coordinating  existing  autoimmune  disease  data  collection
systems  and  biorepository  resources  across  NIH;  creating  a
database  of  such  resources  to  facilitate  research  collabora-
tion, and coordinating with external databases that may have
useful  data  (e.g.,  the  VA Million  Veterans  Program,  the  UK
Biobank and industry biorepositories).

	 Coordinating  autoimmune  disease  research  across  other
HHS agencies and other federal agencies (e.g., AHRQ, CDC,
FDA) to promote cohesion in efforts to advance generation of
knowledge and care delivery for autoimmune disease.


	 The Office would conduct or contract for evaluations of ongoing

efforts.


	 The Office would produce annual reports on the progress made
on autoimmune disease research activities for Congress. Annual
congressional reports can provide key information on priorities
and outcomes to enable policymakers to assess the level of fund-
ing for autoimmune disease research. Others who could benefit
from such information are key stakeholders in the autoimmune
disease research enterprise and members of the public.


	 Building  on  this  report  and  other  relevant  reviews,  the  Office
would  lead  the  development  of  an  enhanced  information  sys-
tem  for  autoimmune  disease  research.  The  committee’s  efforts
revealed challenges that researchers and policy makers may face
in easily accessing, synthesizing, and analyzing relevant research
opportunities and results. The committee believes that, consistent

434

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

with NIH’s existing and excellent information systems, more can
be done to allow researchers ready but refined access to research
opportunities and ongoing research efforts.

Creating OAD/AR comes with substantial advantages. Virtually all
of the advantages enumerated above regarding the creation of an Insti-
tute would apply. For example, an Office would raise visibility, provide
sustained  leadership,  and  establish  a  clear  focal  point  for  autoimmune
disease research within NIH and externally through extramural, intramu-
ral, training, communication, and outreach activities. An Office properly
constituted and supported could even be leaner and more agile than an
Institute.

Proximity to the NIH Director brings obvious advantages, including
influence,  visibility,  and  status.  Furthermore,  the  Office  would  benefit
from interactions and collaborations with other Offices in the NIH OD and
would  be  positioned  to  identify  and  leverage  other  NIH-wide  research
activities  that  align  with  the  autoimmune  disease  research  agenda.  The
Office  would  both  bring  and  benefit  from  a  crosscutting,  independent
perspective  that  would  allow  more  objective  priority  setting,  measure-
ment, and evaluation.

OAD/AR  would  independently  advocate  for  and  promote  trans-
parency,  and  it  would  establish  a  framework  for  accountability  among
relevant ICs. This would build goodwill among stakeholders that in turn
would strengthen support for the research endeavor. Finally, fewer costs
and controversies generally come with creating offices than with creating
new institutes.

The  committee  acknowledges  that  beyond  the  caveats  raised  in  the
introduction above, creating an Office is not without potential challenges.
First, though more modest than those required by a new Institute, creating
a new Office would require significant resources for infrastructure, robust
staffing, and the capacity to function nationally and internationally as a
convener, broker, and communication hub. Second, it would likely require
new  funding  to  stimulate  new  crosscutting  and  collaborative  autoim-
mune disease research and enhance workforce development. Third, the
more  authority  and  resources  it  is  granted,  the  more  opposition  it  may
encounter. Opposition may bring some disruption, some of which may be
unproductive, and resistance that may undercut collaboration.

On  balance,  the  committee  believes  that  the  advantages  of  creating
an  Office  significantly  outweigh  the  disadvantages.  Such  an  Office  has
potential promise and impact in expanding both the frontiers and near-
term  impacts  of  autoimmune  disease  research.  The  committee  believes

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

435

that creating OAD/AR is the best alternative for strengthening autoim-
mune disease research at NIH.

RECOMMENDATIONS

As discussed above, the committee considered five options for enhanc-
ing  autoimmune  disease  research  and  resulting  outcomes:  increased
funding,  two  options  for  coordinating  research,  establishing  a  national
strategic plan, establishing a new Institute, and creating a special office
for autoimmune disease research. With the caveats noted above, the com-
mittee  believes  that  a  well-configured  Office  of  Autoimmune  Disease/
Autoimmunity Research could be an essential ingredient in further stimu-
lating promising and impactful autoimmune disease and autoimmunity
research  at  NIH  that  can  be  translated  into  clinical  practices  that  will
prevent  autoimmune  diseases  or  improve  the  lives  of  those  living  with
autoimmune disease.

Recommendation  1:  The  Director  of  the  National  Institutes  of
Health  should  create  an  Office  of  Autoimmune  Disease/Autoim­
munity Research within the Office of the Director.

Acknowledging that creating an OAD/AR may take some time, the
committee makes two specific recommendations related to data collection
that could be implemented independent of the Office by ICs, one inde-
pendently and the other in collaboration with other ICs. First, progress on
autoimmune disease requires substantially more sophisticated and refined
epidemiology  on  the  individual  and  aggregate  burden  of  autoimmune
disease. The extant knowledge base is growing, but there are important
gaps, including incidence and prevalence trends, comprehensive evalu-
ations  of  the  risk  factors  and  the  burden  (including  direct  and  indirect
costs) of these diseases, the impact on different populations, the trajectory
of these diseases from the period before disease manifests through the life
course, and the impact of specific treatments and interventions.

The  committee  found  a  lack  of  long-term  (20  years  or  more)  popu-
lation-based epidemiology studies on autoimmune disease.  Such stud-
ies  would  allow  for  assessing  trends,  identifying  differences  among
population  subgroups,  and  determining  the  prevalence  and  incidence
of under-researched autoimmune diseases and conditions, such as celiac
disease. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End  Results  Program,  which  provides  information  on  cancer  incidence
and survival in the United States, is a model for such studies that already
exists at NIH.

436

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Recommendation 2: The National Institutes of Health should estab­
lish  long-term  systems  to  collect  and  ensure  optimum  usability
of  population-based  surveillance  and  epidemiological  data  (e.g.,
incidence,  prevalence)  on  autoimmune  diseases  and  measures  of
autoimmunity (e.g., autoantibodies, inflammation) and support the
optimization of existing data sources.

The  committee  also  found  that  few  studies  exist  that  are  able  to
provide  information  on  the  long-term  progression  of  autoimmune  dis-
ease  beginning  in  the  period  before  disease  manifests  through  the  life
course. Such studies would allow for a greater understanding of the het-
erogeneity of disease expression and changes with time and over various
life stages. Such studies could be designed to address a wide variety of
disease outcomes and health effects.

Establishing  population  cohorts  is  critical  for  studying  mechanisms
leading  to  autoimmune  diseases.  Early  life  exposures  and  timing  of
these  exposures  influence  health  at  different  life  stages  at  a  population
and individual patient level. Autoimmune diseases are long-lasting and
heterogeneous conditions for which manifestations and coexisting mor-
bidities  change  over  time.  It  is  essential  to  support  long-term  (10–20+
years)  patient  cohort  studies.  Such  studies  would  provide  understand-
ing  of  opportunities  for  developing  clinical  treatments  and  behavioral
interventions.

Recommendation 3: The National Institutes of Health should sup­
port  the  development  of  population  cohorts  that  extend  from  the
period before disease manifests to the development of symptoms
and disease, and should support patient cohorts that will allow the
examination  of  the  progression,  coexisting  morbidities,  and  long­
term (20+ years) outcomes of autoimmune diseases. Data collection
should include, but need not be limited to:
•	  Genome-wide association
•	  Environmental and occupational exposures such as respirable

silica, vitamin D and iodine, viruses, and smoking

•	  Autoantibody, cytokine, and T cell assays, particularly in new-

onset disease

•	  Response  to  therapeutic  interventions,  including  timing  of
treatment (e.g., to assess whether early treatments prevent dis­
ease progression)

•	  Development of co-occurring autoimmune diseases

Finally,  to  address  the  research  gaps  outlined  throughout  this
report,  a  comprehensive  national  research  agenda  for  autoimmune  dis-
eases is required. Achieving this objective will require coordination and

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

437

collaboration  among  researchers,  research  groups,  and  stakeholders  as
well as the dedicated pursuit of research that defines autoantibodies that
predict  and  diagnose  autoimmune  diseases;  identifies  common  mecha-
nisms in inflammation; determines gene–environment interactions within
and  across  autoimmune  diseases;  examines  the  role  of  environmental
exposures on autoimmune diseases; elucidates disparities and their deter-
minants; determines the impact of coexisting morbidities and complica-
tions of autoimmune diseases on clinical outcomes, functional outcomes,
quality of life, and health care utilization; and explores the effect of inter-
ventions to mitigate impact of coexisting morbidities and complications
for patients with autoimmune disease across the lifespan.

During  the   course   of   researching  Chapters   3   and   4,   the  committee
assembled  a  list of  research  needs  based  on  committee  judgment.  The  list
below is not intended to be comprehensive. However,  it is indicative  of
the  kinds  of  research  needed,  and  by itself  is  far-reaching in  terms  of  the
kinds  of  research  and  disciplines  required  as  well  as  the  many diseases
included   in  the   autoimmune   disease   category.   The   committee   believes
that a robust effort will be required to coordinate creation of a comprehen-
sive  national  research  agenda  that incorporates  the  thinking of  associated
ICs and other stakeholders, and as such illustrates the role that an OAD/
AR  could  fill  as  no  other  currently existing entity could.

Recommendation  4:  The  National  Institutes  of  Health  should
provide  funding  and  support  for  a  national  autoimmune  disease
research agenda that addresses key gaps identified by the commit­
tee.  Prioritized  research  streams  should  include,  but  need  not  be
limited  to,  clinical  and  basic  research  that  addresses  the  research
streams below.

Heterogeneity  in  autoimmune  diseases  takes  many  forms,  which
could range from differences in symptom presentation and disease pro-
gression, as seen in persons with systemic lupus erythematosus, to sever-
ity of disease, as observed in myocarditis in men compared with women,
to varying responses to the same therapy.

Dissect  heterogeneity  across  and  within  autoimmune  diseases  to
decipher common and disease-specific pathogenic mechanisms.
•  Examine common  innate inflammatory pathways  (e.g., damage-
associated  molecular  patterns,  pathogen-associated  molecular
patterns,  pattern  recognition  receptors,  inflammasomes,  and
associated   signaling  pathways),   dysregulated   cellular  pro
cesses,  and  altered  metabolism  across  multiple  autoimmune
diseases  to  understand  the  biologic  mechanisms  underlying

438

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

development, progression, remission, and exacerbation of auto­
immune diseases in children and adults

•	  Apply  machine  learning  methods  that  combine  layers  of
“omics”  data  (e.g.,  genomics,  proteomics,  metabolomics)  to
generate new mechanistic hypotheses and inform discovery of
novel  drug targets



	 Elucidate   mechanisms   by  which   sex-specific   factors   (such   as
hormones,  X  and  Y  chromosomes,  birth  control  products,  endo
crine  disrupting  chemicals)  influence  autoimmune  disease,
examining the  effect  of puberty,  pregnancy,  and  menopause  to
understand  sex  differences  in  autoimmune  diseases
Identify  autoantigens  across  autoimmune  diseases  using  new
technologies  that  allow  T-cell  receptors  identified  by single  cell
RNA  sequencing  from  tissue  to  be  interrogated  without  bias
transfecting  mRNA  libraries  into  reporter  antigen  presenting
cells

•	  Dissect molecular mechanisms associated with poor outcomes
•	  Design research that bridges animal models and human studies
to better understand  common  mechanisms  in  inflammation  for
specific  autoimmune  diseases

Researching less common autoimmune diseases can be difficult owing
to smaller pools of persons affected. At the same time, identifying genetic
variants, for example, could reveal insights that might be applied to more
common diseases. Persons suffering from rare diseases that are associated
with severe illness and or/early mortality are of particular concern.

Study  rare  autoimmune  diseases  and  develop  supporting  animal
models.
	 Study  autoimmune   diseases   that   affect   fewer  individuals   but
often   have   a  high   morbidity/earlier  mortality  to  reveal   novel,
shared, or dominant molecular pathways and novel or improved
therapeutic  options
- Dominant  pathways  in  the  less  common  autoimmune  dis

eases  may  reveal  shared  molecular  pathways  with  other
autoimmune diseases to facilitate drug-repurposing, rapid
trials, and possible therapies that could rapidly impact clin
ical  care

•	  Develop animal models to better understand the mechanisms

of rare  autoimmune  disease

Chapter 4 reviewed a variety of signals being explored as biomark-
ers  to  predict  disease,  confirm  diagnosis,  and  predict  flares  of  disease.

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

439

Further  investigation  of  these  and  novel  signals  can  inform  preventive
and therapeutic strategies.

Define autoantibodies and other biomarkers that can diagnose and
predict the initiation and progression of autoimmune diseases.
•	  Determine the pathophysiological relationship of antibodies to
autoimmune  disease—for  example,  which  autoantibodies  are
biomarkers   of  autoimmune   diseases,   which   are   effectors,   and
the  reasons  for the  differences

•	  Determine the temporal relationship of antibodies to  autoim
mune disease—for example, how and why some autoantibodies
appear decades before clinical illness and others appear simul
taneously with  first  symptoms



	 Understand   differences   in   autoantibody  profiles   by  age,   sex,
sex-and-age,  race,  ethnicity,  and  ancestry  for  individual  auto
immune  diseases  and  in relation  to their ability to predict  and
diagnose  autoimmune  disease

	 Examine  whether infections  (e.g.,  SARS-CoV-2)  and/or chemi
cals (e.g., bisphenol A) influence autoantibody levels/types and/
or immune complex  formation  that  are  diagnostic  or pathologi
cal  for autoimmune  diseases

•	  Explore  the  pipeline  for  development  and  validation  of  auto-
antibodies  as  disease  biomarkers  and  surrogate  endpoints  of
disease
Identify novel biomarkers and complex “signatures” that pre
dict  and  diagnose  autoimmune  diseases  including  cytokines,
microRNAs  and  other markers


As discussed in Chapter 2 and Chapter 4, genetics, and particularly
gene variants, environmental exposures, and timing interact to increase or
blunt an individual’s susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Identifying
the biological functions of gene variants and the effects of environmental
exposures on their functions over time could reveal new avenues for care.

Determine  the  biologic  functions  of  genetic  variants  and  gene–
environment interactions within and across autoimmune diseases
using novel, cutting-edge technologies.
•	  Study early-onset (e.g., childhood-onset) and rare autoimmune
diseases  to  identify  pathologic  genetic  variants  and  potential
mechanistic insights

•	  Systematically  map  genetic  variants  of  individual  autoim
mune  diseases  to biologic  functions  in  different  populations  in
order to (1)  translate  genotype  to phenotype,  (2)  define  immune

440

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

pathways that may predict response to treatment, and (3) inform
understanding of the effect of environmental exposure in auto­
immune diseases

•	  Understand genomic and pharmacogenomic  data as they relate
to  the   individual,   that   are   disease   specific,   or  provide   insight
across  multiple  autoimmune  diseases


	 Explore chimeric antigen receptor-T cell/natural killer cell ther­


apies to benefit immune regulation

	 Use  and   improve  artificial  intelligence,  computational  sci
ence, and other technologies to understand gene–environment
interactions

Social   determinants   of   health   such  as   trauma,   including  cumulative
childhood stress as a result of adverse childhood experiences, can increase
the   risk  of   autoimmune   disease   (Dube   et  al.,   2009;   Roberts   et  al.,   2017).
Similarly, the trauma and the dust clouds of the September 11, 2001 attack
have been implicated in the increased risk of systemic autoimmune disease
in exposed  persons  (Miller-Archie  et al.,  2020).  The  mechanisms  by which
social   determinants   and   environmental   exposures   act  alone  and   together
to  affect the  risk for  and  course  of  autoimmune  disease  over  the  life  span
should  be  investigated  using systematic  approaches  whenever possible.


Examine  the  role  of  environmental  exposures  and  social  determi­
nants of health in autoimmune diseases across the lifespan.
	 Systematically examine  the  effect  of environmental  exposures
(e.g.,  chemical,  infectious,  dietary)  and  social  determinants  of
health in children and adults, including stress, for individual
and/or multiple  autoimmune  diseases,  including disease  flares
	 Determine   the   effect   of  environmental   exposures   on   immune
pathways in patients and animal models of autoimmune disease
•	  Utilize a life-course approach along with advanced methodolo
gies  (e.g.,  computational  science)  to  identify  and  examine  the
potential   effect   of  interacting  co-exposures   that   may  increase
susceptibility to disease, and to understand how these factors
affect  onset,  progression,  and  severity of disease

	 Conduct   a   systematic   investigation   of  the   effects   of  nutrients,
dietary  antigens,  exercise,  aging,  and  microbiome  in  normal
tissue  development  and  homeostasis  in  the  pre-clinical  phase
of disease  and  during disease  and  recovery

•	  Explore novel methodologies to identify distinct and interacting
biological and biopsychosocial factors contributing to observed
sex/gender differences  in  autoimmune  diseases,  including the
effect   of  puberty,   menopause,   and   pregnancy  on   autoimmune
diseases


ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

441

As  indicated  in  Chapters  3  and  4,  individuals  frequently  develop
more than one autoimmune disease at a time as well as complications and
other morbidities. The data on co-occurring autoimmune diseases focuses
only on a limited number of diseases. Evaluating the epidemiology and
risks for developing other morbidities, identifying those at greatest risk,
assessing the impacts of coexisting morbidities, and developing interven-
tions to prevent or ameliorate these could greatly improve patient care.

Determine the impact of coexisting morbidities, including co-occurring
autoimmune diseases and complications of autoimmune diseases,
across  the  lifespan,  and  develop  and  evaluate  interventions  to
improve patient outcomes.

Investigate the occurrence of and risk factors for disease com­
plications  (e.g.,  functional  impairment,  disability,  growth
impairment),  co-occurring  autoimmune  diseases,  coexisting
morbidities  (e.g.,  cardiovascular  disease,  cancer),  and  psycho­
social conditions (e.g., fatigue, depression, pain)
Investigate  the  effects  of  complications  and  coexisting  mor­
bidities on clinical outcomes (e.g., adherence to therapy, disease
activity, disease damage), functional outcomes (activity and par­
ticipation  in  daily  and  community  life,  education  and  work
status), health-related quality of life, and healthcare utilization
and costs.

•	  Conduct  research  to  improve  understanding  of  the  long-term


consequences of autoimmune diseases in children


•	  Develop and test treatment models, targeting those at highest
risk, that prevent, detect, and address complications and coex­
isting  morbidities  in  persons  living  with  autoimmune  disor­
ders, incorporating chronic disease self-management strategies
and other approaches
For complications for which there are no highly effective treat­
ments, such as pain and fatigue, develop, identify, and test new
therapies

•	  Develop  and  test  interventions  to  improve  or  address  lack  of
or inadequate social support in order to improve symptom and
disease management and daily life, including interventions for
parents of children with autoimmune disorders

There are disparities in who develops autoimmune diseases as well
as how the diseases progress; among the causes for disparities are differ-
ences in living environments, access to and affordability of care, and even
provision of care. Researchers have observed, for example, that Hispanic

442

patients and patients in the U.S. South with autoimmune disease-related
kidney failure are less likely to receive kidney transplants than non-His-
panic patients or patients in the U.S. West and Northwest (Costenbader et
al., 2011; Knight et al., 2014). Research to identify the causes of and risks
of disparities, interventions to mitigate them, and the most effective way
to implement mitigations is needed, particularly in groups who receive
suboptimal care and are underrepresented in clinical populations.

Foster research to advance health equity for all autoimmune disease
patients.

Investigate  genetic,  biological,  and  social  determinants,  and
environmental mechanisms of autoimmune diseases in differ­
ent  racial,  ethnic,  and  other  underrepresented  groups,  as  well
as across sexes and over the lifespan
Identify individuals at high risk of autoimmune diseases and
implement prevention strategies
Investigate  disparities  and  determinants  of  disparities  in  dis­
ease stage at presentation and progression of disease, including
complications, coexisting morbidities, functional impairments,
and disability



•	  Explore  novel  methodologies  to  identify  distinct  and  inter­
acting  biological  and  biopsychosocial  factors  contributing  to
observed sex differences in autoimmune diseases

•	  Collaborate with consumers, community-based organizations,
and other partners to develop and evaluate health care delivery
and/or policy interventions to address identified disparities and
generate  evidence  to  support  their  feasibility,  sustainability,
and dissemination

•	  Build  long-term  partnerships  between  patients,  communities,
clinicians,  and  scientists  to  increase  participation  of  under-
served  populations  in  interventional  clinical  trials  and  other
clinical and translational research studies

	 Conduct dissemination/implementation research to determine


best practices and to improve outcomes for all

•	  Conduct  research  on  how  to  increase  recruitment  of  under-
served  populations  in  clinical  research,  and  in  interventional
clinical trials in particular

•	  Conduct  research  on  how  best  to  target  interventions  for
patients with worse outcomes and/or underserved populations

Chapter 2 noted that rates of many autoimmune diseases are rising.
Chapter 3 revealed that there are inadequate data on the financial costs
of autoimmune diseases. For diseases where good data are available such

ENHANCING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

as inflammatory disease and celiac disease, the estimated costs are high.
As these costs will impact public health budgets, research to define costs
should be undertaken as findings could inform research priorities.

Assess the direct and indirect costs of autoimmune diseases.
•	  Examine  insurance  claim  data  to  assess  inpatient,  emergency
room, outpatient, physician visit, pharmacy (including dispari
ties between different therapies), laboratory, and medical device
costs  associated  with  autoimmune diseases

•	  Examine the costs of lost wages, job turnover, and other work-

productivity issues

•	  Examine the costs of premature mortality
•	  Examine the costs of associated home care and child care

Epidemiology: Select Diseases

SJÖGREN’S DISEASE

Epidemiology Overview

Few studies have examined the incidence or prevalence of Sjögren’s
disease,  and  the  data  are  limited  to  “primary”  Sjögren’s  disease  (i.e.,
Sjögren’s disease occurring  alone),  which  excludes individuals with co-
occurring  systemic  rheumatic  disease  such  as  SLE,  rheumatoid  arthri-
tis, systemic sclerosis, or dermatomyositis. A recent study estimated the
annual incidence of primary Sjögren’s disease in New York County (Man-
hattan) as 3.5 cases per 100,000 persons (Izmirly et al., 2019). This estimate
does  not  include  children  with  Sjögren’s  disease  and  therefore  grossly
underestimates the overall incidence of Sjögren’s disease. The same study
estimated the prevalence of primary Sjögren’s disease in this population
to be 13.1 per 100,000 persons (Izmirly et al., 2019). Again, however, chil-
dren were not included, and Sjögren’s disease commonly co-occurs with
other autoimmune diseases, so while this prevalence may reflect primary
Sjögren’s disease in adults, it fails to capture the full extent of individuals
in the United States with Sjögren’s disease. In recent studies, 30 percent
of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis also had Sjögren’s disease (Har-
rold et al., 2020), while about 15 to 20 percent of individuals with SLE had
Sjögren’s disease (Aggarwal et al., 2015; Baer et al., 2010). In addition, a
study  has  shown  that  patients  with  primary  Sjögren’s  disease  are  often
initially  misdiagnosed  with  SLE  or  rheumatoid  arthritis  (Rasmussen  et

463

464

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

al., 2016). Thus, the overall prevalence of Sjögren’s disease in the United
States is likely greater than 0.3 percent of the population.

Sex, Age, Racial, and Ethnic Disparities

Diagnosis  of  Sjögren’s  disease  most  commonly  occurs  in  the  fifth
to  seventh  decades  of  life,  though  it  may  occur  from  early  childhood
through late adulthood (Brito-Zerón et al., 2020; Ramos-Casals et al., 2020;
Sjögren’s  Foundation,  2021).  Sjögren’s  disease  is  diagnosed  more  com-
monly in females, with a female-to-male ratio of 6:1 based on small stud-
ies in the United States (Izmirly et al., 2019; Maciel et al., 2017), though
large  global  studies  have  found  an  even  higher  female-to-male  ratio  of
14:1  in  adults  and  a  slightly  decreased  ratio  of  5:1  in  children  (Basiaga
et al., 2020; Brito-Zerón et al., 2020; Ramos-Casals et al., 2020). Sjögren’s
disease  occurs  across  races  and  ethnicities  but  is  diagnosed  more  com-
monly  in  White  individuals.  Among  over  10,000  adults  with  Sjögren’s
disease  in  a  multinational  study,  77  percent  were  White  individuals,  14
percent Asian individuals, 6 percent Hispanic individuals, and 1.4 percent
Black individuals (Brito-Zerón et al., 2020). Measures of disease activity
indicated that disease activity was highest in Black individuals, followed
by White, Asian, and Hispanic individuals.

Specific disease manifestations differed according to ethnicity and age
(Ramos-Casals et al., 2021). For example, children had a higher frequency
of  glandular  swelling,  rashes,  and  cytopenias  but  a  lower  frequency
of  dryness,  whereas  the  frequency  of  pulmonary  and  neuromuscular
manifestations increased with age at presentation. In a recent U.S.-based
study,  the American  Indian  population  was  disproportionately  affected
by Sjögren’s disease, displaying a higher risk of diagnosis and increased
disease  activity  (Scofield  et  al.,  2020). Additional  studies  are  needed  to
further define racial and ethnic disparities.

SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

Epidemiology Overview

A  recent  meta-analysis  based  on  data  from  a  Centers  for  Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) network of four national lupus registries
estimated  overall  SLE  incidence  in  the  United  States  as  5.1  per  100,000
person  years  for  2002  to  2009  (Izmirly  et  al.,  2021a).1  Some  of  the  most
comprehensive data on SLE are from studies based in Michigan, Georgia,
and  California  associated  with  the  CDC  national  lupus  registries.  The

APPENDIX D

465

registries  provide  incidence  and  prevalence  data  for  select  state  areas.
Incidence of SLE was 4.6 per 100,000 persons in San Francisco County in
California (Dall’Era et al., 2017), 5.5 per 100,000 in southeastern Michigan
(Somers et al., 2014), and 5.6 per 100,000 in Fulton and DeKalb counties
in Georgia (Lim et al., 2014). The Manhattan Lupus Surveillance Program
(Izmirly et al., 2017), a registry of residents in New York County (Man-
hattan),  found  an  annual  incidence  of  4.6  cases  per  100,000  persons  for
2007 to 2009 and a prevalence rate of 62.2 cases per 100,000 persons for
the year 2007.

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

A meta-analysis of CDC national lupus registries found the U.S. inci-
dence of SLE in women to be approximately seven times higher than in
men for the years 2002–2009 (Izmirly et al., 2021a). In each of the Michigan
(Figure D-1A), Georgia, and California studies, incidence rates for women
were 5 to 10 times higher than for men across all ages and in each racial or
ethnic group studied (Dall’Era et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2014; Somers et al.,
2014). For women, each of these studies also found considerably higher
rates of the disease in Black patients than in White patients, with a marked
increase in incidence between the ages of 20 and 60 years, as represented
by  Georgia  data  in  Figure  D-1B.  For  White, Asian-Pacific  Islander,  and
Hispanic patients, however, incidence rates among women showed less
variation across these age groups (Figure D-1C).

Similarly, in the New York study (Izmirly et al., 2017), the incidence
and  prevalence  rates  of  SLE  were  around  nine  times  higher  in  women
than  in  men.  When  examining  only  women,  incidence  and  prevalence
rates were highest for non-Hispanic Black women, and showed a marked
increase in the 20–59 age groups (Figure D-2). White, Hispanic, and Asian
women showed less variation across these age groups.

Investigators have conducted a meta-analysis of data from the Cali-
fornia,  Georgia,  Michigan,  and  New  York  studies  and  from  the  Indian
Health Service and estimated a prevalence of SLE for the United States
of 72.8 per 100,000 (Izmirly et al., 2021b). Between 80 and 90 percent of
individuals with SLE are female, and SLE is two to three times more com-
mon  in  Black,  Indigenous,  and  people  of  color.  The  highest  prevalence
of SLE was seen in American Indian and Alaska Native women at 270.6
per 100,000 women, and Black women at 230.9 per 100,000 women, while
the rate for Hispanic women was lower at 120.7 per 100,000 women but
still  43  percent  higher  than  the  rate  for  White  women  (84.7  per  100,000
women) and Asian and Pacific Islander women (84.4 per 100,000 women)
(Izmirly et al., 2021b).

FIGURE D-1  Continued

Although the rates of some autoimmune diseases are lower in chil-
dren than adults, these diseases have a significant impact on the children
and  their  families.  Juvenile-onset  SLE,  which  occurs  before  age  18,  is
estimated  to  affect  about  15  to  20  percent  of  people  with  SLE  (Charras
et al., 2021; Hersh et al., 2010). Data on U.S. studies suggest that the inci-
dence  of  juvenile  SLE  ranges  from  0.36  to  2.5  per  100,000  children  and
the estimated prevalence is from 1.9 to 34.1 per 100,000 children (Charras
et al., 2021). Childhood-onset SLE shows population-level differences in
incidence and prevalence similar to those seen in adult-onset disease. In
a  study  of  the  U.S.  Medicaid  beneficiary  population  from  2000  to  2004,
the annual incidence of SLE in children 3 to <18 years old was 2.22 per
100,000 Medicaid-enrolled children and that of lupus nephritis, a frequent
complication of SLE, was 0.72 per 100,000 (Hiraki et al., 2012). In the same
population,  prevalence  estimates  for  children  with  SLE  were  9.73  per
100,000 Medicaid enrolled children, of whom 84 percent were female, 40
percent were Black, 25 percent were Hispanic, and 21 percent were White.
In addition, 37 percent of children with SLE had lupus nephritis, repre-
senting a prevalence of 3.64 per 100,000 Medicaid-enrolled children. Both
prevalence and incidence rates of SLE and lupus nephritis increased with
age, were higher in girls than in boys, and were higher in all non-White
racial and ethnic groups (Hiraki et al., 2012).

SLE exemplifies important disparities in disease severity, physical and
mental morbidity, and mortality across racial and ethnic groups. Indeed,
SLE is the fifth leading cause of death in Black and Hispanic females aged
15 to 24 years old in the United States (Yen and Singh, 2018). Furthermore,
research has identified disparities in outcomes of SLE in children, includ-
ing care delivery and SLE-related conditions such as mental health disor-
ders (Rubinstein and Knight, 2020). These disparities may exist according
to race and ethnicity, income, and geography.

Some of the most severe SLE manifestations are lupus nephritis and
neuropsychiatric  lupus  (NPSLE). Although  lupus  nephritis  and  NPSLE
typically  occur  early  in  the  disease  course,  they  can  occur  years  after
the onset of disease in some patients. NPSLE has many manifestations,
including  seizures,  cerebrovascular  disease,  demyelinating  syndrome,
psychosis, cognitive dysfunction, acute confusional state, chorea, myelop-
athy,  mononeuritis  multiplex,  and  peripheral  neuropathies  (Ford  et  al.,
1999;  Gulinello  et  al.,  2012).  Both  nephritis  and  NPSLE  manifestations
may remit, or more commonly, result in long-standing damage.

One U.S. study of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) resulting from SLE
found  that  rates  of  ESRD  in  Black  individuals  ages  5  to  39  with  lupus
nephritis  increased  during  the  1995  to  2006  period  (Costenbader  et  al.,
2011). Researchers, using data from the same study, further observed that
Black children were half as likely to receive a kidney transplant as White
children and twice as likely to die from ESRD caused by lupus nephritis.
Hispanic children and adults, compared with non-Hispanic children and
adults, were also less likely to receive kidney transplants. Researchers also
found that children living in the U.S. West and Northwest were placed on
kidney transplant wait lists more often that children living in the South
(Hiraki et al., 2011). A large study of hospitalized children with SLE in the
United States, using data from the Kids’ Inpatient Database,2 found both
regional and racial disparities in mortality, with Black children and chil-
dren from southern states having twice the risk of death compared with
White children and children from northeastern states (Knight et al., 2014).
While these studies do reveal disparities among certain U.S. subpopula-
tions, the committee believes that efforts to understand these disparities
would benefit from large epidemiologic studies covering a wide range of
demographic characteristics.

ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME

Epidemiology Overview

Because  of  technical  differences  in  assessing  antiphospholipid  anti-
bodies and APS’s overlap with SLE and other autoimmune diseases, epi-
demiology data for this illness are scarce, but the prevalence is thought to
be 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 persons (Cervera, 2017; Duarte-Garcia et al.,
2019).  Reports  on  demographics,  incidence,  prevalence,  and  population
outcome often come from retrospective studies that are not generalizable
(Erkan et al., 2012, 2021). A recent population-based study in Minnesota
addresses that bias, but is limited in its generalizability in that it is based
in  a  relatively  small  and  homogenous  population  with  a  low  incidence
of SLE (Duarte-Garcia et al., 2019). Prospective studies and clinical trials
with diverse participants and large sample sizes could yield more accu-
rate and relevant results (Erkan et al., 2012; FDA, 2021).

The  2022  International  Classification  of  Diseases,  10th  Revision,  Clinical
Modification  (ICD-10-CM)  code  for  antiphospholipid  syndrome  (D68.61)
became effective on October 1, 2021 (ICD10 Data, 2021). This code excludes
the common finding of a positive lupus inhibitor test, as measured by spe-
cialized coagulation tests, in an asymptomatic person, suggesting use of
the code R76.02 instead.

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

Isolated   thrombotic   APS   affects   both   sexes   equally  (NORD,   2016).
When  APS  occurs  with  another  autoimmune  disease,  that  disease  is
most  often   lupus,   and   because   the   majority  of   individuals   with  lupus
are  female,   APS  associated  with  other  illnesses  is  female  predominant.
Considering  obstetric   and   thrombotic  APS   together,  APS   is   female   pre-
dominant. In  a  population-based  study of  incidence  of  APS  in  ages  ≥18
years,   the   female-to-male   ratio   was   1.0   (Duarte-Garcia   et  al.,   2019);   this
low ratio may result from the relative lack of representation of people at
higher  risk of  SLE  in  this  study.  Unlike  SLE,  the  risk of  APS  is  greatest in
White  populations  and  relatively low  in  Black populations  (Duarte-García
et al., 2019;  Izmirly et al.,  2021b).

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

Epidemiology Overview

Rheumatoid  arthritis  is  one  of  the  most  common  autoimmune  dis-
eases,  affecting  an  estimated  2.4  million  adults  in  the  United  States

APPENDIX D

471

(Kawatkar et al., 2019). Although incidence rates for rheumatoid arthritis
decreased in the United States and Europe in the latter part of the 20th
century, the trends since the 1990s have demonstrated relatively stable or
somewhat rising rates (Myasoedova et al., 2010; Safiri et al., 2019). During
the period 1995 to 2007, based on the Olmsted County, MN, population,
overall age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence was 40.9 per 100,000 popu-
lation (Myasoedova et al., 2010).

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

The  incidence  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  begins  to  rise  in  women  and
men aged 35 to 54, with the highest rates in both women and men among
those  aged  65  to  74.  Female-to-male  incidence  ratios  are  about  3:1  dur-
ing reproductive and perimenopausal years, and decrease to about 1.5:1
for individuals over the age of 55 (Myasoedova et al., 2010). Incidence is
higher in the United States and northern European countries (Alamanos
et al., 2006). Studies in specific American Indian and Alaska Native com-
munities (Blackfeet, Yakima, Chippewa, and Pima) have reported higher
prevalence rates of rheumatoid arthritis than reported for the general U.S.
population estimate (Kawatkar et al., 2019; McDougall et al., 2017).

With respect to health outcomes and disability measures among peo-
ple with rheumatoid arthritis, studies have observed higher disease activ-
ity and lower rates of remission among Black and Hispanic populations
compared with White populations (Barton et al., 2011; Greenberg et al.,
2013). Early treatment with the newer, more targeted therapies is recom-
mended (Fraenkel et al., 2021), but use of these medications may depend
on insurance coverage and access to care.

PSORIASIS

Epidemiology Overview

The annual incidence of psoriasis in the United States is estimated to
be  78.9  new  cases  per  100,000  persons  (Icen et al.,  2009),  though  a  more
recent  study  based  on   health  administrative   data  for   Ontario,   Canada,
reported  an  incidence  rate  of  69.9  cases  per  100,000  persons  in  2015  (Eder
et al.,  2019).  A  medical records-based  study in a  large  health  maintenance
organization  in  northern  California  estimated  the  prevalence  of  psoriasis
to be 939 per 100,000, which translates to approximately 2.5 million U.S.
adults  (Asgari  et al.,  2013).  The  prevalence  among U.S.  children  is  lower,
with 128  cases  per  100,000  (Paller  et al.,  2018).

472

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

The incidence of psoriasis is similar among men and women; how-
ever men may experience more severe forms of the disease (Hägg et al.,
2013).  The  prevalence  of  psoriasis  increases  over  the  life  course,  with
prevalence of 0.12 percent at age 1 year and 1.2 percent at age 18 years
(Augustin et al., 2010). A 2015 study of psoriasis in U.S. children and ado-
lescents estimated the prevalence at 128 per 100,000 persons. The preva-
lence was higher in females than in males—146 per 100,000 versus 110 per
100,000—and increased with age, ranging from 30 per 100,000 in the 0 to 3
age group to 205 per 100,000 in the 12 to 17 age group (Paller et al., 2018).
The location of lesions and the type of psoriasis may also vary by age. For
example, psoriasis is more likely to affect the face in children, and guttate
psoriasis, which manifests as red, scaly, small, teardrop-shaped spots, is
more common among children than adults (Boehncke and Schön, 2015).
White individuals had the highest prevalence of psoriasis at 3.6 per-
cent,  followed  by  other  racial/ethnic  groups  (including  multiracial)  at
3.1  percent,  and  Hispanic  and  Black  individuals  at  1.9  percent  and  1.5
percent, respectively (Armstrong et al., 2021).

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE

Epidemiology Overview

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease have emerged as global dis-
eases  in  the  21st  century  (Ananthakrishnan  et  al.,  2020).  Estimates  of
the  prevalence  of  these  diseases  in  the  United  States,  obtained  using
U.S.  medical  records,  range  from  1.3  to  2.3  million  persons.  Another
study using less rigorous, self-report methods suggest estimates as high
as 3.9 million persons. The true prevalence is unknown (see Box 2-1 in
Chapter 2).

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

Epidemiologic  studies  from  Olmsted  County,  MN,  found  that  the
incidence  of  Crohn’s  disease  among  women  and  men  was  about  the
same,  though  the  incidence  of  ulcerative  colitis  was  slightly  higher  for
males than females (Shivashankar et al., 2017). The highest incidence of
both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease occurs in the second to fourth
decades, and particularly in the 20 to 29 age range.

Pediatric IBD accounts for approximately 25 percent of cases of IBD,
and  approximately  18  percent  of  children  with  IBD  will  present  before
age  10  (Rosen  et  al.,  2015).  The  prevalence  of  IBD  in  children  under  17
years of age is about 77.0 per 100,000 people in the United States, which

APPENDIX D

473

translates  into  58,000  children  between  the  ages  of  2  and  17  affected  by
IBD  (Ye  et al.,  2020).  The  prevalence  of  pediatric  IBD  in  the  United  States
has increased by 133 percent from 2007 to 2016, from 33.0 to 77.0 cases per
100,000   people,   with  Crohn’s   disease   being  twice   as   prevalent  as   ulcer-
ative  colitis  at 45.9  cases  of  Crohn’s  disease  per  100,000  children  versus
21.6 cases of ulcerative colitis per 100,000 children (Ye et  al., 2020). Studies
have  observed  geographic  variability in  IBD  rates,  with the  incidence  ris-
ing in  developing countries  and  urban  areas.  Changes  in  diet that affect
the intestinal microbiota, exposure to sunlight  or temperature differences,
socioeconomic   status,   and   hygiene   are   among  the   environmental   vari-
ables   that  most  likely  explain  that  geographic   variability  (Benchimol   et
al.,  2017;  Bernstein  et al.,  2019).  In  infantile  IBD  or  very-early-onset IBD,
researchers have identified genetic mutations a  s the ba
sis f  or this s  uscep-
tibility in up  to  10  percent of  cases,  which  suggests  a  simple  monogenic
origin  of  the  disease  in these  cases  (Ouahed,  2021).

White individuals and people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent have the
highest  incidence  of  IBD,  though  the  incidence  of  IBD  is  increasing  in
Hispanic  and  Asian  populations  (Hou  et  al.,  2009;  Santos  et  al.,  2018).
IBD is more prevalent in urban areas and higher socioeconomic popula-
tions  compared  with  rural  areas  and  lower  socioeconomic  populations
(Benchimol et al., 2017; Bernstein et al., 2019). IBD is a familial disorder
in up to 12 percent of those affected, and the strongest risk factor for the
development  of  IBD  is  a  first-degree  relative  with  the  disease.  There  is
an  approximately  4-fold  increased  risk  of  ulcerative  colitis  in  the  chil-
dren  of  mothers  or  fathers  with  ulcerative  colitis  and  an  almost  8-fold
increased  risk  of  Crohn’s  disease  in  the  children  of  mothers  or  fathers
with Crohn’s disease (Agrawal et al., 2021; Moller et al., 2015), as well as
similar patterns regarding which parts of the intestinal system the disease
affects. Some children of parents with IBD develop disease during the first
decade of life. In a small study, the relative risk for concordant disease in
monozygotic twins was estimated at 95.4 for Crohn’s disease and 49.5 for
ulcerative colitis. The relative risk in dizygotic twins was 42.2 and 0.0 for
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively (Bengtson et al., 2010).

CELIAC DISEASE

Epidemiology Overview

Celiac  disease  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  tissue  transglu-
taminase  autoantibodies  (tTGA)  that  often  precedes  the  biopsy-proven
diagnosis  of  celiac  disease  (Gandini  et  al.,  2021).  Using  the  presence  of
tTGA in serum samples to provide an estimate of disease in the United
States,  a  study  based  on  data  from  the  National  Health  and  Nutrition

474

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Examination  Survey  estimated  a  seroprevalence  of  790  per  100,000  per-
sons over 5 years of age (Mardini et al., 2015), which corresponds to 2.3
million  people.  Estimates  place  the  worldwide  seroprevalence  of  celiac
disease  at  1.4  percent,  and  the  worldwide  prevalence  of  biopsy-proven
celiac disease at 0.7 percent (Singh et al., 2018).

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

Celiac disease is 1.5 times more common in females than in males, and
approximately 2 times more common in children than in adults (Singh et
al., 2018). The prevalence and incidence of celiac disease has been increas-
ing  over  time,  which  suggests  that  changing  environmental  factors  are
influencing  the  development  of  this  disease  (Lohi  et  al.,  2007;  Ludvigs-
son et al., 2013). Studies have found the prevalence of celiac disease to be
highest in Europe and Oceania (0.8 percent) and lowest in South America
(0.4 percent), with Africa (0.5 percent), North America (0.5 percent), and
Asia (0.6 percent) being intermediate (Singh et al., 2018). Studies estimate
that the prevalence of celiac disease in the United States is four to eight
times higher among non-Hispanic Whites compared with other racial and
ethnic groups (Mardini et al., 2015).

PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS

Epidemiology Overview

The incidence of PBC in the United States is 4 to 5 per 100,000 persons
per year (Lu et al., 2018). Incidence rates have been relatively stable dur-
ing the past 20 years (Kanth et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018), but the prevalence
has increased during this time from approximately 22 per 100,000 persons
to 39 per 100,000 persons (Lu et al., 2018). This difference may reflect ear-
lier treatment leading to improved patient outcomes. The 5-year mortality
rate is approximately 15 to 20 percent.

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

PBC is predominantly a disorder of women, who account for approxi-
mately 90 percent of all cases. The typical age of onset is in the fifth or
sixth decades of life, and the highest reported incidence and prevalence is
in northern Europe and the northern United States (Lv et al., 2021).

Studies  have  reported  increased  prevalence  in  some  Indigenous
groups  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  (Yoshida  et  al.,  2006).  In  com-
parison to White patients with PBC, Indigenous Canadians present with
advanced  disease  and  have  worse  long-term  outcomes  (Roberts  et  al.,

APPENDIX D

475

2022).  Although  rates  are  higher  among  White  and  Asian  and  Pacific
Islanders compared with Black populations (Lu et al., 2018), the severity
of disease at diagnosis may be greater in Black and Hispanic compared
with  White  populations  (Peters  et  al.,  2007),  which  has  implications  for
treatment options and outcomes.

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

Epidemiology Overview

Multiple  sclerosis  is  the  most common  CNS  inflammatory disorder,
though incidence  data  for  the  United  States  do  not exist.  The  overall 2010
U.S.  prevalence  of  multiple  sclerosis  was  estimated  at  309  per  100,000
persons  (Wallin  et al.,  2019),  equating to  approximately 775,000  cases  of
multiple sclerosis in the United States in 2020. The prevalence of multiple
sclerosis  has  increased  worldwide  between 1990  and  2016  (Walton  et al.,
2020),  while  studies  have  not consistently found  an  increase  in  incidence.
Therefore,  the  increasing multiple  sclerosis  prevalence  is  likely a  result of
a  combination  of  increased  awareness  leading to  increased  detection,  bet-
ter  diagnostic  technology,  the  increasing age  of  the  populations  studied,
and  increased  survival  of  those with  the  disease.

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

Women are more than twice as likely as males to live with multiple
sclerosis as males, with a 2.8-fold higher prevalence (Wallin et al., 2019).
For  adult-onset  multiple  sclerosis,  the  mean  age  at  clinical  diagnosis  is
30  years  (Mayo  Clinic,  2021).  Onset  of  multiple  sclerosis  in  childhood
is uncommon, occurring in 2 to 10 percent of individuals with multiple
sclerosis (Yan et al., 2020; Yeh et al., 2009). Sex and age at diagnosis differ
by the type of multiple sclerosis, however, with nearly equal proportions
of  men  and  women  having  primary  progressive  multiple  sclerosis  and
showing a later onset—approximately 10 years—than those with relaps-
ing-remitting multiple sclerosis (Tremlett et al., 2005, Table 2, p. 1921).

A  study  of  racial  and  ethnic  variability  in  multiple  sclerosis  in  the
multi-ethnic  community-dwelling  members  of  a  California  health  plan
showed  a  higher  annual  incidence  in  Black  members,  with  10.2  cases
per 100,000 persons, compared with White members, with 6.9 cases per
100,000  persons,  and  lower  rates  in  Hispanic  members,  with  2.9  cases
per  100,000  persons,  and Asian  and  Pacific  Islander  members,  with  1.4
cases per 100,000 persons (Langer-Gould et al., 2013). The prevalence of
multiple  sclerosis  is  higher  in  non-Hispanic  Black  compared  with  non-
Hispanic White populations, and there is even lower prevalence in Asian,

476

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Pacific Islander, and Hispanic populations (Romanelli et al., 2020). There
is  a  dearth  of  data  on  delay  in  diagnosis  in  racial  and  ethnic  minority
populations, however, with several studies suggesting that delays result
from a lack of access to a multiple sclerosis specialist and to perceptions
among physicians that the disease is more common in White populations
(Stuifbergen et al., 2021).

TYPE 1 DIABETES

Epidemiology Overview

A study in Olmstead County, MN, between 1994 and 2010 reported an
overall annual incidence of type 1 diabetes of 9.2 per 100,000 people per
year among all  ages,  and  19.9  per  100,000  people  for those  younger  than
20  years  (Cartee  et al.,  2016).  A  population-based  registry across  five  U.S.
sites reported an annual incidence of 21.7 per 100,000 in people under the
age  of  20  in  2011  to  2012  (Mayer-Davis  et al.,  2017).

An  estimated  178,000  individuals  under  the  age  of  20  have  type  1
diabetes in the United States (Dabelea et al., 2014). One study based on
non-verified,  self-reported  data  collected  through  the  National  Health
Interview Study in 2016 and 2017 estimated that 0.5 percent of the U.S.
population had a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. In 2020, this would have
represented about 1,485,000 adults living with the disease (Bullard et al.,
2018; Xu et al., 2018).

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

The annual incidence of type 1 diabetes in individuals 19 years and
younger is almost twice that of adults 20 to 64 years of age (Rogers et al.,
2017). In studies of individuals ages 0 to 19, type 1 diabetes often occurs
during  two  peaks:  at  ages  5  to  7  and  during  puberty  (Atkinson  et  al.,
2014). In the 0 to 19 age group, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes is similar
in males and females (Dabelea et al., 2014), though the incidence of the
disease increased among boys but not among girls between 2002 and 2012
(Mayer-Davis et al., 2017). In adults, there is a higher incidence of type 1
diabetes in males compared with females (Rogers et al., 2017).

During the period from 2001 to 2009, a large U.S. study showed an
increase  in  type  1  diabetes  prevalence  in  the  0–19  age  group  from  1.48
per 1,000 individuals to 1.93 per 1,000 individuals (Dabelea et al., 2014).
A subsequent  study  of  the  U.S.  Medicaid  pediatric  population  showed
an  increase  in  annual  type  1  diabetes  prevalence  from  1.29  per  1,000
individuals to 2.34 per 1,000 individuals during 2002 to 2016 (Chen et al.,

APPENDIX D

477

2019). This trend was not seen, however, in a study spanning 1994 to 2010
in Olmsted County, MN (Cartee et al., 2016).

In the United States, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes in the age 0 to
19 population is highest among non-Hispanic White persons compared
with Hispanic, African American, American Indian, and Native Alaskan
persons (Dabelea et al., 2014). The incidence of type 1 diabetes in that age
group increased 1.4 percent annually, from 19.5 cases per 100,000 youths
per year in 2002 and 2003 to 21.7 cases per 100,000 youths per year in 2011
and 2012. There was a greater rate of increase among Hispanic persons
compared  with  non-Hispanic  White  persons,  with  a  4.2  percent  annual
increase among Hispanic individuals versus a 1.2 percent annual increase
in non-Hispanic White individuals (Mayer-Davis et al., 2017), suggesting
the  influence  of  environmental  factors  that  may  differentially  influence
risk in different ethnic and racial groups.

AUTOIMMUNE THYROID DISEASES

Epidemiology Overview

Despite  being  among  the  most  common  autoimmune  disorders
(Bülow  Pedersen  and  Laurberg,  2009),  there  is  a  lack  of  detailed  epide-
miologic data on Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Graves’ disease for the past
20 years for the United States. Historically, data from Rochester, MN, have
served  as  a  key  source  for  U.S.  data  on  autoimmune  thyroid  diseases
(Furszyfer et al., 1972), although these data predated current methods for
thyroid function testing. Nonetheless, an important finding based on the
Rochester data from 1935 to 1967 was documenting a sharp rise in inci-
dence over the three decades, an increase that appeared most pronounced
among those younger than 40 years old. Data in males were too sparse
to characterize temporal trends, and the study did not find evidence of a
cohort effect.

European  annual  incidence  estimates  of  autoimmune  thyroid  dis-
ease have varied widely, from 51 to 490 cases per 100,000 persons (Galo-
fré  et  al.,  1994;  Vanderpump  et  al.,  1995).  Differences  in  methodologies
and  nomenclature  across  studies  likely  contribute  to  the  wide  range  of
estimates,  although  true  regional  variation  should  not  be  ruled  out.  A
study in 2008 to 2013 in Sheffield, United Kingdom, reported an annual
incidence  of  24.8  cases  per  100,000  persons,  with  a  median  age  of  44
years old at diagnosis. Women accounted for 80 percent of those affected
(Hussain et al., 2017). A large cohort study in the Netherlands examined
thyroid medication use and thyroid hormone levels to classify overt and
subclinical thyroid diseases. Thyroid medication was used by 3.1 percent
of participants, the majority (98.2 percent) of whom used levothyroxine.

478

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Subclinical hypothyroidism was detected in 9.4 percent of the people who
were not taking thyroid medications (Wouters et al., 2020).

Sex, Age, Racial and Ethnic Disparities

Onset  of  autoimmune  thyroid  diseases  typically  occurs  in  mid- to
late-adulthood (Cooper and Stroehla, 2003). A strong female preponder-
ance of up to 95 percent has been reported (Cooper and Stroehla, 2003);
epidemiologic data are lacking for males as a result of how rare thyroid
disease is in men. U.S. data indicate that the prevalence of Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis  is  highest  in  White  populations. A histologic  study  in  Balti-
more from 1955 to 1960 documented an approximately four times greater
prevalence in White females compared with Black females (Masi, 1965),
and a study based on data from the third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey conducted from 1988 to 1994 found that prevalence
of  anti-thyroid  antibodies  was  highest  among  White  populations,  fol-
lowed by Mexican American populations, and was lowest in Black popu-
lations (Hollowell et al., 2002). Trends related to race and ethnicity have
been less well characterized for Graves’ disease. However, a 2014 report
of active-duty U.S. military personnel found that the incidence of Graves’
disease was significantly higher among individuals from Black and Asian
or Pacific Islander populations compared with those from White popula-
tions, and trended higher in Hispanic populations compared with White
populations (McLeod et al., 2014). This study also corroborated the earlier
race and ethnicity trends observed for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (McLeod
et al., 2014).

Analysis of the NIH Autoimmune Disease

Research Grant Portfolio: Methodology

BACKGROUND

Congress  tasked  the  Committee  for  the  Assessment of  NIH  Research
on Autoimmune Disease to assess NIH research activities on autoimmune
disease.  The  committee  responded  to  this  task,  in  part,  by describing NIH
investments or spending on autoimmune disease research grant activities.
The committee used publically available NIH data sources, primarily the
Research,  Condition,  and  Disease  Categorization (RCDC) system  and  the
RePORTER  database,  to  conduct its  analysis.  They are  described  below,
along with the  methods  used  to  describe  different aspects  of  the  research
portfolio  (spending on autoimmune  disease  research  by NIH  and  Insti-
tute  and  Centers  (ICs);  spending  on  autoimmune  disease  research  by
research  activity;  spending on autoimmune  disease  research  by disease;
IC  collaborations;  clinical trials,  publications,  and  patents  associated  with
autoimmune   disease   research   grants;   and   an  analysis   of   study  sections
reviewing autoimmune  disease  grants).

RESEARCH, CONDITION, AND DISEASE

CATEGORIZATION SYSTEM

The NIH Reform Act of 2006 required NIH to prioritize consistency
and  transparency  by  creating  a  tool  to  categorize  the  agency’s  funded
research.  Implemented  in  2008,  the  RCDC  system  “uses  sophisticated
text data mining (categorizing and clustering using words and multiword

501

502

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

phrases)  in  conjunction  with  NIH-wide  definitions  used  to  match  proj-
ects  to  categories.”1  RCDC  compiles  a  list  of  all  the  funded  grants  and
contracts that fit into the specific categories and includes details such as
funding  amounts  and  other  grant  characteristics.2  These  categories  are
referred to as “spending categories.”

The  RCDC  categorization  process  enables  NIH  to  apply  the  latest
technology to consistently report on how America’s tax dollars are spent
to support medical research.3 A new spending category may be added to
the system based on scientific need and/or at the request of an external
source such as patients, advocacy groups, or Congress. Spending catego-
ries can also be added at the request of the Director of NIH or an IC. As
of  June  2021,  there  are  299  research/disease  areas  in  RCDC,  including
the Autoimmune Disease spending category of interest to the committee.
Since RCDC was implemented in 2008, research has only been categorized
since  then.  At  the  time  of  the  committee’s  work,  the  most  recent  data
available were for fiscal year (FY) 2020. Thus, the timeframe for the Com-
mittee’s analysis is from FY 2008 to FY 2020.

RePORTER

RePORTER is a publically available electronic database that “allows
users  to  search  a  repository  of  both  intramural  and  extramural  NIH-
funded research projects from the past 25 years and access publications
since 1980, and patents resulting from NIH funding.”4 RePORTER draws
from a number of internal and external databases to compile information
associated  with  research  projects.  These  include  the  electronic  research
administration  (eRA)  databases,  Medline,  PubMed  Central,  the  NIH
Intramural  Database,  and  Interagency  Edison  (iEdison)  database  that
contains  grantee  reporting  on  inventions  and  patents.5  RePORTER  is  a
dynamic database that is updated weekly. Updates include the addition
of new projects as well as revisions to prior awards, which may prevent
an exact replication of the data used in this report.

RCDC and RePORTER have unique purposes thus they do not share
all of the same information or variables. Further, similar information or
variables in RCDC and RePORTER may differ as they are published on

different  timelines  and  have  varying  budget  nuances,  thus  these  data
systems should not be directly compared. Acknowledging these nuances,
the committee drew upon information from both data sources in order to
adequately analyze autoimmune disease research funding.

Autoimmune Disease Spending Methodology

The committee used the NIH RePORTER database to evaluate fund-
ing and other aspects of the NIH autoimmune disease research portfolio.
The RePORTER database allows users to query or search by the spending
categories  specified  by  RCDC  (presented  as  “NIH  Spending  Category”
in the RePORTER advanced projects search). The committee focused its
analysis on the autoimmune spending category.

The committee conducted the following search in RePORTER:
Advanced Projects Search:

Fiscal Year:
•  2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013
•  2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020

Project Details:
•  NIH Spending Category: Autoimmune Disease
•  Agency/Institute/Center: NIH

Once  the  search  results   were  generated,  they  were  exported   into
Excel   along  with   optional   variables   (project  description,   project  details,
personnel,  funded  organization,  project funding).  A  maximum  of  15,000
projects  can  be  downloaded  into  Excel  at a  time,  thus,  four  combinations
of the above search criteria were exported. Two exported datasets did not
include  information on  the  ICs  that funded  the  grants  (FY  2008–2013  and
FY  2014–2020);  these  datasets  were combined  and  used  to  conduct NIH
level   analyses.   The  two   datasets   (2008–2013   and   2014–2020)   containing
information  on  funding ICs  were  also  combined  and  used  to  conduct IC
level   analyses.   When  a   research   project  application   is   funded   by  more
than one  IC,  it is  listed  once  for  each  IC.  For  example,  if  a  grant application
was  co-funded by two  ICs  it will  appear  in  the  dataset twice.

The  two  datasets  described  above  were  used  as  the  source  for  the
majority of the committee’s analyses and are referred to as the Committee
RePORTER Datasets (CRD).

The following figures and tables that describe spending on autoim-

mune disease research were prepared using the datasets.

This methodology is associated with the analyses in Figures 6-1 and

6-2 and Tables 6-1 and 6-2.

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

Categorization of Grants by Autoimmune Diseases of Interest

For  a  number  of  analyses  the  committee  was  interested  in  reporting
data  by  the  autoimmune  diseases  they  chose  to  focus  on.  To  carry  out
those   analyses,   CRD   data   were   summarized   or   rolled   up  into   “grants.”
An  explanation  of  the  method  used  to  do  this  follows.

Exported RePORTER datasets contain a row of information for each
funded grant application, including the total dollar amount awarded for
each year. For example, a 5-year grant awarded between 2008 and 2020
will  appear  as  five  separate  rows  with  the  same  grant  number,  though
there may be variation among project descriptions, details, and funding
in the dataset. When the CRD data set was exported, there were 28,148
rows of funded grant applications. To review the data at the grant level
(as opposed to the yearly grant application level), grant applications were
aggregated by the project or grant number; this resulted in a total of 8,470
grants. Grants were then categorized by disease, using RCDC spending
categories (based on the committee's disease selection, RCDC categories
are available for inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, psoria-
sis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus), and using
MeSH terms6 and natural language processing software for diseases with-
out a RCDC category (antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune thyroid
disease, celiac disease, primary biliary cholangitis, Sjögren’s, type 1 dia-
betes).  Hashimoto’s  disease  and  Graves’  disease  were  combined  into  a
single “autoimmune thyroid disease” category. Grants can be counted in
more than one disease category. Grants that were not associated with any
specific disease categories were labeled as “other autoimmune disease.”
This methodology applies to all tables and figures that provide analyses
by the committee’s autoimmune diseases of interest.

Creation of New Dataset Variables

Two new variables were created to support specific committee analy-
ses related to the type of research funded, and to provide a more complete
estimate of the total cost of autoimmune disease research funding. These
new variables are described below.

Autoimmune Disease Spending by Research Type

The  committee  sought  to  analyze  NIH’s  autoimmune  disease
research  portfolio  by  type  of  research  (investigator-initiated,  solicited,

6 MeSH terms are produced by the National Library of Medicine and are used for index-
ing, cataloging, and searching of biomedical and health-related information https://www.

and intramural research) and funding. This analysis provides insights into
how  NIH  allocates  its  funds  across  these  research  activities  and  trends
over  time.  To  identify  research  type,  Funding  Opportunity  Announce-
ment (FOA)7  numbers were examined. Within each CRD, a new variable
“Type of Research” was created.





If the FOA number was a Request for Application (RFA) or Request
for Proposal (RFP), it was categorized as solicited research.
If  the  FOA number  was  a  Program Announcement  (PA),  it  was
categorized as investigator-initiated research.
If the Activity Code8  started with Z, it was categorized as intra-
mural research.
If the FOA number was blank, it was categorized as Unknown.

If the type of research is Unknown, it was not included in the Type of
Research analysis. The FOA field may be blank in some cases such as non-
grant records (contracts and intramural records), and older grant records
from a time when it was not required to submit a grant in response to a
FOA. Because intramural research does not have an FOA, the designated
intramural activity code (Z) was used to determine the type of research.

Combined Total Cost of Funded Autoimmune Research

The committee noted differences in funding information available in
RCDC and RePORTER early in its analysis of spending on autoimmune
disease research. Due to the different purposes of the data systems, nei-
ther system provides a complete estimate of the total cost of autoimmune
disease  research  funding  by  IC.  The  committee  created  a  new  variable,
Combined  Total  Cost  of  Funded Autoimmune  Research  to  address  this
issue and added it to the CRD.

There are two types of projects found in the CRD, projects that stand
alone and subprojects. A subproject is a “discrete and clearly identifiable

segment of a multicomponent application…most commonly subprojects
are part of the M, P, S, and U mechanisms.”9  Stand-alone projects have a
designated funding IC(s) in the RePORTER database, but subprojects do
not; subproject funding by IC is only available as part of RCDC report-
ing. The committee needed this information in order to determine how
much funding each IC contributed to autoimmune disease research. Out
of necessity, the committee used RCDC data to identify subproject fund-
ing  by  IC.  RCDC  datasets  for  each  FY  2008  to  2020  were  downloaded
and  used  to  inform  subproject  funding  IC  and  to  configure  total  dollar
amounts  in  the  CRD.  Generally,  RCDC  and  RePORTER  should  not  be
directly  compared  as  they  serve  different  purposes,  are  published  on
different  timelines,  and  have  varying  budget  nuances.  However,  fund-
ing  IC  dollar  amounts  would  be  significantly  underestimated  without
utilizing both data sources. RCDC dollar amounts are frozen and may not
always  match  the  frequently  updated  data  in  RePORTER. Additionally,
RePORTER separates Total Cost for projects and Total Cost for subproj-
ects, making it challenging to determine the total amount of dollars any
one  IC  spent  on  autoimmune  disease  research.  A  new  variable,  “Com-
bined Total Cost of Autoimmune Disease Research,” was created to reflect
consolidated funding for stand-alone projects and subprojects in one vari-
able; it was added to the CRD.

The new variable, Combined Total Cost of Funded Autoimmune Dis-
ease  Research,  is  used  in  the  analyses  associated  with  Figure  6-1  and
Tables 6-1, 6-2, and 6-4.

be included in multiple spending categories so amounts may add up to
more than 100 percent of NIH-funded research. Additionally, the specific
amounts associated with multiple spending categories are not specified.
For example, hypothetical Grant A with a total cost of $100,000 has three
associated  spending  categories:  autoimmune  disease,  cancer,  cardiovas-
cular. Although the data do not provide information on the percentage of
dollars allocated to each of the spending categories (because the catego-
ries are defined irrespective of the budget), the total amount is considered
to  be  dollars  that  supported  autoimmune  disease  research  (the  autoim-
mune disease spending category).

Another limitation is that NIH actual total obligations reported by the
Office of the Budget are not provided for autoimmune disease research.
Because these dollar amounts come from exclusive sources, the committee
was unable to directly compare them. Despite the nuances in data sources,
the committee was able to gauge the percentage of autoimmune disease
spending across NIH compared to NIH actual total obligations as seen in
the analysis associated with Figure 6-1 and Table 6-1.

Methods for Additional Specific Analyses

IC Collaboration

An Excel pivot table was created within the CRD containing funding
ICs from FY 2008-2020 to examine the relationship between the IC admin-
istrating a grant and ICs that contribute funding to the grant. An admin-
istrative IC with at least one funding IC was considered a collaboration,
also known as joint IC funding. To determine the average number of joint
IC funding collaborations over the period, the number of collaborations
were summed and divided by 13 (years). The range of joint IC funding
collaborations per year included the least amount of collaborations in a
given  year  within  the  committee’s  specified  time  period,  and  the  most
amount of collaborations in a given year within the time period, by IC.
This methodology was used in the analyses associated with Table 6-8.

Study Section Analysis

The  committee  used  the  online  CSR  study  section  tool  available  at
https://public.csr.nih.gov/StudySections.10  The  committee  entered  the
name  of  each  of  the  select  autoimmune  diseases  of  committee  interest
into the study section search field to identify the names of its associated
chartered  study  sections.  Only  chartered  study  sections  were  included

because  they  review  most  investigator-initiated  research  grant  applica-
tions. The total number of chartered study sections for all select diseases
(de-duplicated) was then tallied.

The  committee  used  the  RePORTER  Matchmaker  search  tool  avail-
able  at  https://reporter.nih.gov/matchmaker.11  The  committee  entered
the name of each of the select autoimmune diseases of committee interest
into the field to yield the number of projects associated with that disease.
The user then activated the Active Projects feature and selected 2019 and
2020 in the Fiscal Year dropdown. RePORTER then generated a graph of
the study sections that had reviewed the most grants for that autoimmune
disease.  The  study  sections  appearing  in  the  graph,  and  the  number  of
grants each study section reviewed, constitute the data included in Table
6-10.

Clinical trials

Using clinicaltrials.gov, 637 clinical trials were identified and exported.
Clinical trials were then linked to the 8,470 autoimmune disease grants of
interest using a matching algorithm. The National Academies staff then
manually reviewed the clinical trials to ensure that they were related to
the  committee’s  autoimmune  diseases  of  interest  or  the  other  autoim-
mune disease category. This resulted in a total of 353 clinical trials used
in  the  analysis.  This  methodology  was  used  in  the  analyses  associated
with Figure 6-26.

Publications

To determine the publications associated with the autoimmune dis-
ease grants of interest, a variety of NIH and public databases were used,
including PubMed, Scientific Publication Information Retrieval and Eval-
uation  System  (SPIRES)  bibliometric  tools,  and  Web  of  Science  (WoS).
SPIRES  linked  peer-reviewed  publications  to  the  autoimmune  disease
grants  of  interest.  Disease  information  for  publications  is  based  on  the
disease categorization of associated grants. To characterize scientific pro-
ductivity and impact, the list of related publications associated with the
grants of interest were analyzed using the following metrics: total number
of publications, number of publications by disease type, and publication
distribution over time from publication year 2008 to 2020. Relative Cita-
tion Ratios (RCRs) were retrieved from iCite, a tool created by the Office
of  Portfolio  Analysis  within  NIH,  to  access  bibliometrics  for  relevant
publications. Journal impact factor was obtained from WoS for the articles

publication year. This methodology was used in the analyses associated
with Figures 6-27, 6-28, and 6-29, and Table 6-12.

Patents

Patent data  (patent and  patent applications)  were  gathered  from  the
U.S.  Patent Databases  (USPTO)  and  RePORTER.  Patent data  was  linked  to
8,470  autoimmune  disease  grants  of  interest using a  matching.  All  linked
data are in the public domain. Disease information for patent applications
and   patents   is   based   on   the   disease   categorization   of   associated   grants.
This  methodology was  used  in the analyses  associated  with  Figures  6-30
and  6-31.

Topic Analysis of NIH Autoimmune

Disease Research Grant Abstracts

Authored by:1  Chris Barousse2,3

INTRODUCTION

In 2019, Congress tasked the National Academy of Sciences, Engineer-
ing and Medicine (the National Academies) to evaluate National Institutes
of Health (NIH) research on autoimmune disease. The scope of work for
the committee included a review of trends in the focus (topics) of autoim-
mune disease research. The goal of this paper is to provide insight into
the most popular research topics associated with 8,470 NIH autoimmune
disease research grant abstracts using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), a
statistical modeling technique used in natural language processing.

BACKGROUND

LDA is a popular, well-documented statistical method used in natu-
ral  language  processing (NLP)  settings.  LDA  groups  what the  NLP  field
refers to as a corpus of texts by “latent” topics, which are found by look-
ing  at  the   similarity  of  the   texts’   contents   (Blei   et  al.,   2003).  As   of   2021,
the  original  paper  describing  LDA   methodology  has  been  cited  5,714
times.  Several  software  packages  in  the  R  statistical language  can  imple-
ment  LDA,   and   this   method   has   been   applied   specifically  to   scientific
abstracts  to  analyze  funding patterns  and  trends  in research  (Bittermann
and  Fischer,  2018;  Park et al.,  2016;  Porturas  and  Taylor,  2021).

An LDA model consists of probabilities for each word belonging to
each topic, and probabilities of each document belonging to each topic.
LDA makes several assumptions about the corpus. First, it assumes that

511

512

ENHANCING NIH RESEARCH ON AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

each document is  a  collection  of  words  and  disregards  the  sequence  and
grammar  of  the  document;  this  is  called  the  bag-of-words  model.  Second,
LDA   assumes   that  the   corpus   contains   knowledge   about  many  topics  k
and that the user has already removed words that are either too rare or too
common and stopwords, which are words that do not provide any mean-
ingful information and in most situations include pronouns, prepositions,
articles,  and  conjunctions.  If  words  are  sparse  throughout the  corpus,  the
model  will  take  a  long time  to  search  through the  corpus  finding the  rare
words.   Including  words   that  are   too   common   will   generate   topics   that
are  too  similar  to  each  other and  make  discerning between  them  difficult.
LDA  sees  documents  as  consisting of  one  or  more  words,  and  words  can
belong to  one  or  more  topics  with  a  different probability of  belonging to
each topic.

The  LDA algorithm  is  iterative,  meaning  that  the  user  must  decide
how  many  times  it  is  run  on  a  corpus.  Running  it  more  increases  the
chance of finding distinct topics, but running LDA is time and computa-
tionally intensive. First, each word is randomly assigned a probability for
belonging in topic t. The code then goes through each word w belonging
to document d and computes the proportion of words in the document
d that are assigned to the topic t, the proportion of assignments to topic
t over all the documents that contain the word w, and the updated prob-
ability of the word w belonging to topic t. Averaging the probabilities of
each  word  belonging  to  a  specific  topic  gives  the  topic  probabilities  for
each document.

Methods

LDA works well to “assess trends in the focus of NIH research and
address  whether  the  trends  are  reflective  of  the  changes  in  epidemiol-
ogy  as  compared  to  other  factors  such  as  availability  of  research  tools
and  technologies,  and  emerging  biomedical  knowledge  and  concepts”
(NASEM, 2021). Given a set of 8,470 NIH research grant abstracts related
to autoimmune diseases that were funded between 2008 and 2020, topic
modeling using LDA was implemented to discern which topics are preva-
lent within the abstracts.

In   preparing  the   grant  abstracts   for   analysis,   words   that  were   too
common in the  abstracts,  including the  words  research  and  studies,  were
removed. Because there was no pre-determined value of  k to use, coher-
ence  scores  were  calculated  to  determine  an  optimal  number  of  topics
(Syed   and   Spruit,   2017).   Coherence   is   a   measure   of   how   similar   words
within a topic are and how distinct topics are from each other. Coherence
is  calculated  on a full LDA  model; this  means  that the  LDA  algorithm  was
run 60 times to compare 60 values of  k.  Figure  H-1  is  a  plot that calculates

APPENDIX H

the coherence of models fit using various values of k, the number of top-
ics.  A higher  coherence  score  implies  that  the  topics  generated  using  k
number of topics fit the data well. In consultation with the committee, it
was decided to use the model specified with 30 topics.

Once the LDA model was chosen, the names of the 30 topics needed
to be determined. LDA does not assign a name to the topics, and it is com-
mon practice to look at the top words assigned to each topic to determine
what ideas each topic is trying to convey. There is no significance in the
numbers  associated  with  each  topic  or  the  order  of  topics  given  by  the
model. Figure H-2 shows the top 10 most frequent words assigned to each
topic. In consultation with committee members, a name was assigned to
each topic. Table H-1 lists the final topic names; some topics were given
the  same  topic  name  because  they  were  deemed  too  similar,  and  their
topic assignments were combined in the later plots.

Final Results

One of the outputs of the LDA model is the theta matrix, which shows
the  proportion of topics  assigned  to  each abstract. For example, 30 percent
of an abstract may be attributed to topic 1, and 70 percent of it may be
attributed  to  topic  2.  Theta  has  N (the  number  of  abstracts)  rows  and  K
(the   number   of   topics)   columns,   and   each   row   in   the   matrix  sums   to   1.
For  each fiscal  year,  the  proportion  of  each topic  attributed  to  all  abstracts
funded  that  year  was  summed  and  a  separate  plot  was  made  for  each
topic.  In  other  words,  the  y-axis  is  the  proportion  of  abstracts  funded
in  a  given  year  that was  attributed  to  that topic.  Figure  H-3  groups  the
topics by theme: immune response related, clinical, disease focused, and
administrative.

Conclusion

Figure H-3 can be used to determine trends in topics over time using
the  LDA  model.  Treatment/therapy,  lung  disease,  diagnostic  [tools],
imaging,  and  inflammatory  bowel  disease  have  trended  upward  from
2008 in contrast to animal models, genetics, and pathogenesis, and dia-
betes is consistently prevalent among topics over time. Cancer, multiple
sclerosis, cardiovascular, psoriasis, lung disease, and rheumatoid arthritis
are also consistent over time but not as popular as diabetes. It is difficult
to explain the spikes in popularity in administrative topics. This could be
related to NIH funding policies or other funding pattern changes.

One  of  the  downsides  of  using  LDA for  topic  modeling  is  that  the
topics  must  be  discovered  “latently”  within  the  texts;  the  topics  cannot
be inputted into the model algorithm. Furthermore, it would have been

interesting  to  see  how  popular  specific  diseases  of  interest,  including
celiac disease, autoimmune thyroid disease (consisting of Hashimoto and
Graves’ disease), antiphospholipid syndrome, primary biliary cholangitis,
and Sjögren’s disease, are over time. If the LDA model had been allowed
to  include  a  greater  number  of  topics  as  input,  the  likelihood  of  seeing
smaller,  more  specific  topics  would  increase.  However,  increasing  the
number of topics could also allow the algorithm to detect groupings of
words that are not meaningful as it tries to find more topics within the
texts. It can be concluded from the omission of specific diseases from the
final list of topics that they are not well represented within the abstracts
analyzed.
