Management of Crohn Disease
A Review

Kelly Cushing, MD, MSCI; Peter D. R. Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc

IMPORTANCE Crohn disease, a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease, is increasing
in incidence and prevalence in many parts of the world. Uncontrolled inflammation
leads to long-term complications, including fibrotic strictures, enteric fistulae, and
intestinal neoplasia. Therefore, early and effective control of inflammation is of
critical importance.

OBSERVATIONS The optimal management approach for Crohn disease incorporates patient
risk stratification, patient preference, and clinical factors in therapeutic decision-making.
First-line therapy generally consists of steroids for rapid palliation of symptoms during
initiation of anti–tumor necrosis factor α therapy. Other treatments may include monoclonal
antibodies to IL-12/23 or integrin α4β7, immunomodulators, combination therapies, or
surgery. Effective control of inflammation reduces the risk of penetrating complications (such
as intra-abdominal abscesses and fistulae), although more than half of patients will develop
complications that require surgery. Adverse reactions to therapy include antibody formation
and infusion reactions, infections, and cancers associated with immune modulators and
biologics and toxicity to the bone marrow and the liver. Both Crohn disease and
corticosteroid use are associated with osteoporosis. Vaccinations to prevent infections, such
as influenza, pneumonia, and herpes zoster, are important components of health
maintenance for patients with Crohn disease, although live vaccines are contraindicated for
patients receiving immune suppression therapy.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The treatment of patients with Crohn disease depends on
disease severity, patient risk stratification, patient preference, and clinical factors, including
age of onset and penetrating complications, and includes treatment with steroids,
monoclonal antibody therapies, immunomodulators, and surgery. Physicians should
be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each therapy to best counsel
their patients.

I nflammatory bowel disease is an autoimmune disorder that

manifests as a chronic, intractable activation of the intestinal
immune system. There are 2 types of inflammatory bowel dis-
ease (IBD): Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. These subtypes are
differentiated based on disease distribution and histologic find-
ings, although considerable overlap can occur.

The purpose of this review is to provide an evidence-based
update of management options for Crohn disease. In the past sev-
eral decades, the therapeutic armamentarium has significantly
expanded. Previously, therapy options were limited to corticoste-
roids, immune modulators, and surgery. However, more recently,
multiple classes of biologic therapies have been approved for the
management of Crohn disease. Each treatment strategy has risks
and benefits, and appropriate patient counseling and surveillance
are necessary.

Methods

We searched PubMed for clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic
reviews, observational studies, and practice guidelines related to the
natural history and management of Crohn disease. Articles pub-
lished through August 1, 2020, were eligible for inclusion. Articles
selected for inclusion were chosen by the authors based on the best
available data. Priority was given to clinical trials, meta-analyses,
Cochrane reviews, and practice guidelines. Included articles were
restricted to English-language publications.

Six case-control studies, 17 cohort studies, 3 cross-sectional stud-
ies, 7 guidelines, 2 ideas/editorials/opinions, 14 meta-analyses, 14 nar-
rative reviews, 18 randomized controlled trials, and 7 systematic re-
views were included in the review.

Management of Crohn Disease

Epidemiology and Pathogenesis

Box 1. Symptoms and Signs of Crohn Disease

The peak incidence of Crohn disease occurs among patients aged
15 to 25 years, but all ages are affected. In North America, the inci-
dence of Crohn disease is between 6.3 and 23.8 per 100 000
person-years, and the prevalence is between 96.3 and 318.5 per
100 000 person-years.1 The incidence of Crohn disease is increas-
ing globally, notably in countries with increasing industrialization,
air pollution, and Westernization of their diets. Examples include
Brazil, with an annual incidence increase of 11.1% from 1988 to
2012, and Taiwan, with an annual incidence increase of 4.0% from
1998 to 2008.1

The pathogenesis of Crohn disease is multifactorial contribut-
ing factors, including genetics; the host microbiome; and environ-
mental factors, such as smoking, medications, and diet.2-5 To
date, more than 100 genetic markers have been associated with
Crohn disease, highlighting the polygenic nature of the disease.
Implicated genes suggest that immunoreactivity to gut bacteria is
a critical component in the risk of developing Crohn disease.2-4
Interactions between genes and environment may facilitate the
pathogenesis of Crohn disease via damage to the lining of the
intestine or perturbation of immune defenses, which increase
exposure of the primed immune system to intestinal bacteria.

Smoking is a well-described environmental risk factor for both
the development of Crohn disease as well as many adverse disease
outcomes. Smoking has been associated with an increased risk of
Crohn disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.76 [95% CI, 1.40-2.22]), disease
flare (OR, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.21-2.01]), and need for surgery (OR, 1.68
[95% CI, 1.33-2.12]).6,7 Furthermore, in a retrospective cohort study
of patients with Crohn disease in Spain, smokers (n = 1535), com-
pared with nonsmokers (n = 1689), had an increased need for ste-
roids (92% vs 86%; P < .05), immunosuppressive medications (74%
vs 64%; P < .05), and anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic thera-
pies (31% vs 25%; P < .05).8 Therefore, smoking cessation is ad-
vised in all patients with Crohn disease.

Clinical Presentation

Patients with Crohn disease often have symptoms for several years
before the correct diagnosis is confirmed. The cardinal symptoms
(Box 1) include fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight
loss; rectal bleeding is less common, but can occur when the distal
colon is involved. Symptoms can fluctuate over time and are often
misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome. The average median
diagnostic delay is 9 to 18 months from the onset of symptoms,9-11
and longer delays are associated with more intestinal obstruction
and surgery. Isolated small bowel disease can present with protean
constitutional symptoms. Up to 20% of patients can initially pre-
sent with complications of Crohn disease, including intestinal stric-
tures, abscesses, or fistulas.12

Diagnosis and Assessment

Many patients with Crohn disease have signs of anemia; iron defi-
ciency; low vitamin D levels; and elevated inflammatory markers,

Symptoms
Fatigue

Fever

Abdominal pain and cramping

Diarrhea

Mouth sores

Lack of appetite

Thirst and lightheadedness

Urgent bowel movements

Redness or pain in the eyes from uveitis, iritis, or episcleritis

Swollen and painful joints, especially knees, hips, and elbows

Skin inflammation, including eczema, psoriasis, erythema
nodosum, and pyoderma gangrenosum

Signs
Weight loss

Slowed growth in children

Anemia (both iron deficiency and anemia of inflammation)

Mucus in the stool

Blood in the stool

Drainage of serum, pus, or stool from an opening near the anus

Dry mucus membranes

Psoas sign (consider abscess adjacent to terminal ileum)

Orthostatic signs

Elevated markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, fecal
calprotectin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate)

Elevated alkaline phosphatase is associated with primary
sclerosing cholangitis

including C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and
fecal calprotectin. Fecal calprotectin is the most sensitive screen-
ing test for IBD (with estimated sensitivity of 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-
0.91] and specificity of 0.67 [95% CI, 0.58-0.75]), but results can
be negative in patients with isolated small bowel disease.13
Patients with systemic symptoms, bowel symptoms, and evi-
dence of inflammation should be evaluated endoscopically with
biopsies. The hallmark findings of Crohn disease are discontinu-
ous areas of inflammation characterized by ulceration, erythema,
mucosal edema, and/or luminal narrowing (Figure 1). Tissue his-
tology remains the cornerstone of diagnosis and is characterized
by transmural inflammation with architectural distortion, lym-
phoid infiltrates, and/or granulomas (Figure 2). In patients who
do not have rectal bleeding, it is often helpful to perform cross-
sectional imaging with magnetic resonance enterography to iden-
tify locations of inflammation in the intestinal tract to target the
endoscopic approach. Radiologic findings include stratified mural
enhancement and luminal narrowing. Furthermore, cross-
sectional imaging can also detect complications of Crohn disease,
such as intra-abdominal abscesses and fistulae. Some patients
with small bowel disease out of reach of the standard colono-
scope may need a capsule endoscopy to identify ulcerative

lesions followed by a balloon enteroscopy to obtain biopsies. His-
tologic evidence is required for a Crohn disease diagnosis given
the costs and risks of biologic therapy.

The signs and symptoms of Crohn disease may overlap with
other inflammatory or malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal
tract (Box 1). Therefore, careful attention should be paid to the clini-
cal history, which can often assist in identifying alternative etiolo-
gies (Figure 3 and Box 2).

Risk stratification for complicated Crohn disease should be
part of the initial assessment. Patients with early-onset Crohn
disease; small bowel location; perianal involvement; previous
intestinal obstruction, fistula, or abscess; previous intestinal
resections; and early steroid use and those who are current smok-
ers are at increased risk of future complications.14,15 These
patients especially require early effective therapy and close moni-
toring to maintain control of inflammation to prevent future dis-
ease complications.

Extraintestinal Manifestations

Extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn disease can include
enteropathic arthritis (usually of the knees, hips, and shoulders;
prevalence, 10%-20%), sacroiliitis (prevalence, 13%-50%),
ankylosing spondylitis (prevalence, 1%-10%), pyoderma gan-
grenosum (prevalence, 2%), erythema nodosum (prevalence,
6%), uveitis (prevalence, <1%-17%), episcleritis (prevalence, up to
29%), scleritis (prevalence, up to 18%), primary sclerosing chol-
angitis (prevalence, 1%), and mouth ulcers (prevalence, 10%).16-19
The inflammatory arthritides usually manifest as stiffness early in
the morning or after long periods of inactivity, and can improve
with heat, a warm bath, or movement, which is a different pattern
from that of osteoarthritis, which tends to worsen with move-
ment. Pyoderma gangrenosum is an autoimmune phenomenon,
not an infection, and vigorous debridement will make pyoderma
gangrenosum worse. Patients with Crohn disease and recurrent
elevations of alkaline phosphatase could have early-stage primary
sclerosing cholangitis, which can be reliably diagnosed with
a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.20

Treatment

Medical therapies for the management of Crohn disease work
by suppressing an overly active intestinal immune system. Treat-
ment consists of 2 phases: induction and maintenance. Induction
involves a higher dose of a steroid-sparing medication during
the initial weeks to months of therapy to rapidly induce clin-
ical remission. Steroids may be used during the induction phase
of treatment to achieve symptom control. Budesonide can
be used in mild to moderate cases because it has significant
first-pass metabolism in the liver and thus reduced systemic
absorption. Maintenance therapy involves using a lower dose
of a steroid-sparing medication, such as an immune modulator
or a biologic, for the remainder of the patient’s life to keep a
patient in remission and prevent disease flares. Steroids are not
effective maintenance therapies. Further, inappropriate and
excessive use of steroids increases the risk of complications (such

practice claims.21

Many options are available for the medical treatment
of patients with Crohn disease (Box 3). Long-term treatment
strategies target various immune signaling pathways. Therapy
options include immune modulators, such as azathioprine,
6-mercaptopurine, and methotrexate, as well as biologic medica-
tions, such as antibodies to TNF-α, IL-12/23, and integrin α4β7.
Before initiating any biologic therapy, patients should be tested
for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B. Positive test results war-
rant specialty consultation for appropriate treatment prior to
medication initiation.

Mesalamine therapies, which are often used in ulcerative
colitis, are ineffective in the medical management of Crohn dis-
ease. A systematic review that included 20 randomized clinical
trials that evaluated the efficacy of aminosalicylates in mild to
moderate Crohn disease found that high-dose mesalamine was
not superior to placebo in induction of remission (relative risk,
2.02 [95% CI, 0.75-5.45]).22 Immunomodulators, including

methotrexate and thiopurines (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopu-
rine), can be used as maintenance medications for Crohn disease,
but are less effective than biologic therapies or combination
therapies with biologics.23-26 The SONIC trial25 evaluated the
comparative efficacy of thiopurine (n = 170), anti-TNF (n = 169),
and combination therapy with an anti-TNF and a thiopurine
(n = 169) in 508 patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease.
Results showed 30% steroid-free remission at week 26 in those
receiving thiopurine monotherapy, compared with 44% for those
receiving anti-TNF monotherapy (P = .006) and 56% for those
receiving combination anti-TNF and thiopurine therapy
(P < .001).25 Furthermore, trials of thiopurines have suggested
minimal benefit over placebo in early Crohn disease.27,28 A pro-
spective blinded trial of 131 participants (68 randomized to
receive azathioprine and 63 randomized to receive placebo)
found no difference in steroid-free remission throughout the
duration of the study (ie, 76 weeks; 44% vs 36%; P = .47).27
Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are medications in the
anti–TNF-α class.29-32 Ustekinumab is an anti–IL-12/23 monoclonal
therapy33 and vedolizumab is a gut-specific anti–integrin α4β7
monoclonal therapy.34 Selection of therapy is tailored to the indi-
vidual based on treatment history, disease location, disease
severity, and patient comorbidities.

As described above, combination therapy (anti-TNF and thio-
purine) is an effective management strategy for moderate to
severe Crohn disease.25 The SONIC trial showed superiority of
combination therapy (infliximab and azathiprine) over anti-TNF
and thiopurine monotherapy in moderate to severe Crohn dis-
ease. Specifically, those receiving combination therapy had higher
rates of steroid-free remission at week 26 (56%) compared with
those receiving infliximab monotherapy (44%; P = .02) or aza-
thioprine monotherapy (30%; P < .001).25 Therefore, this combi-

nation is considered more efficacious than either monotherapy,
and is considered first-line therapy in the context of severe dis-
ease. The authors also found significantly higher levels of anti-
bodies to infliximab in the infliximab monotherapy group (14%)
compared with the combination therapy group (1%).25 Therefore,
thiopurines are thought to add efficacy and reduce the immuno-
genicity of biologic therapy.

Monitoring on Therapy
The management of Crohn disease requires close monitoring of
inflammation and careful assessment and adjustment of medical
therapy to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission.35 Particu-
larly after a change in therapy, or a change in the dose or fre-
quency of therapy, objective markers of inflammation should be
checked to ensure remission. Such markers may include
C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, cross-sectional imaging, or
endoscopy, depending on the disease location and patient’s
medical comorbidities. The importance of following objective
measures of disease control was illustrated in the CALM study,
which showed that among 244 patients with Crohn disease, the
use of biomarkers, compared with clinical management alone,
was associated with improved rates of mucosal healing at 48
weeks (46% vs 30%; risk difference, 16.1% [95% CI, 3.9%-
28.3%]; P = .01).36 Control of inflammation is strongly associated
with reduced complications of Crohn disease, including intestinal
cancers, strictures, fistulas, and abscesses, along with fewer ste-
roid courses, hospitalizations, and surgical procedures.36-38

Symptoms are a sensitive, but not specific, assessment of in-
flammation. Minimally symptomatic smoldering inflammation can
lead to significant complications and surgery over time. Patients of-
ten adjust to, adapt their diets to, or come to accept chronic symp-
toms that are indicators of clinically important inflammation.

Disease Flares
When a patient has a flare of symptoms, it is important to assess
for infection because Escherichia coli, Norovirus, and Clostrid-
ioides difficile are all common causes of changes in symptoms that
resemble Crohn disease flares. If infection is not found, inflamma-
tion should be assessed and localized. Intestinal inflammation can
be measured with biomarkers (C-reactive protein, fecal calprotec-
tin), imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance
enterography), and/or endoscopy with biopsy. Magnetic reso-
nance enterography should be the imaging modality of choice for
patients younger than 35 years to minimize cumulative radiation
exposure early in life.39,40 In chronic, long-standing Crohn dis-
ease, symptoms may not represent inflammation, but may be
caused by long-term bowel damage. Chronic inflammation, scar-
ring, and surgical procedures can lead to dysmotility, bile acid
diarrhea, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and visceral
hypersensitivity, which cause symptoms despite minimal current
inflammation. Therefore, clinicians should determine whether

persistent symptoms are from disease activity or an alternative
etiology prior to adjusting or changing therapy.

Mild to moderate flares can often be managed with the gut-
selective steroid budesonide, which has fewer adverse effects
than systemic corticosteroids. Repeated courses of steroids
(>2 per year) suggests that adjustment of therapy or surgical
resection is needed. Severe flares will often require intravenous
steroids for hospitalized patients. After induction of remission, a
rigorous assessment of the previous maintenance therapy and
medication adherence should be performed. One response mea-
sure is to check a drug trough and antibiologic antibody level.
Drug-level testing is available for many biologic therapies, includ-
ing infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, vedolizumab, and
ustekinumab, but optimal levels are still being determined for
many of the newer biologic therapies. Patients who have devel-
oped high-titer antibiologic antibodies with undetectable drug
levels (ie, immune-mediated drug failure) or therapeutic levels
without antibiologic antibodies (ie, mechanistic failure) will need

medication use. However, medication discontinuation increases
the risk of relapse, need for surgery, and risk of other disease-
related complications. In a meta-analysis of 3 studies that
included 334 patients, thiopurine continuation was associated
with a decreased risk of disease relapse (OR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.21-
0.6]) up to 18 months.41 Additionally, a meta-analysis of 23 stud-
ies showed that approximately 50% of patients in remission
who discontinued anti-TNF therapy relapsed in the long term
(>25 months).42 For these reasons, medication discontinuation is
generally not advised. De-escalation of therapy can be considered
in select situations, such as for patients receiving combination
therapy (anti-TNF and thiopurine). In an open-label randomized
clinical trial of 50 patients who achieved at least 6 months of clini-
cal remission while receiving combination therapy, there was no
significant difference in subsequent rates of clinical remission at
52 weeks between those who continued combination therapy
(95% [95% CI, 76.5%-99.1%]) and those who continued anti-TNF
therapy alone (93% [95% CI, 72%-98.9%]). Therefore, patients
receiving combination therapy may be considered for thiopurine
de-escalation. Ultimately, decisions about de-escalation are indi-
vidualized and involve discussion between the patient and the
gastroenterologist. Considerations such as age of the patient,
risks of therapy, depth of remission, previous treatment course,
and drug levels influence the decision-making process.

Many patients wish to experiment with complementary
therapy (ie, acupuncture, meditation, dietary changes, herbal
supplements), which should only be used as an adjunct to estab-
lished, effective therapies, and can occasionally cause significant
drug interactions. Adherence to effective therapies, especially
biologic therapies, is essential because skipping doses of biologics
greatly increases the rate of neutralizing antibody formation and
loss of efficacy.43 Many patients may wish to consider stopping or
delaying biologic therapy during a viral upper respiratory infec-
tion. For the vast majority of outpatient infections, biologic
therapy for Crohn disease should be continued, and any discus-
sion of stopping therapy or delaying doses should include the pre-
scribing gastroenterologist.

Review Clinical Review & Education

Many patients want to stop therapy for Crohn disease man-
agement during pregnancy because of concern of adverse effects
on the fetus. Large cohort studies have shown that maintaining
control of inflammation during the pregnancy is the most impor-
tant factor in having a healthy outcome.44 A Swedish cohort
study that included 1220 patients with Crohn disease demon-
strated an increased risk of adverse outcomes, such as preterm
birth (adjusted OR, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.89-3.74]), low birth weight
(OR, 3.30 [95% CI, 2.29-4.74]), and stillbirth (adjusted OR, 4.48
[95% CI, 1.67-11.9]), with active disease.45 Furthermore, a meta-
analysis of 5 studies that included 1216 patients suggested no
increased risk for abortions (OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.97-2.41]), pre-
term birth (OR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.62-1.62]), low birth weight (OR,
1.05 [95% CI, 0.62-1.78]), or congenital malformations (OR, 1.10
[95% CI, 0.58-2.09]) with anti-TNF exposure, highlighting the
safety of continued medical therapy.46 Therefore, it is recom-
mended that individuals who are pregnant continue biologic
therapy during pregnancy to reduce adverse outcomes associ-
ated with disease activity.47 In contrast, methotrexate is contrain-
dicated in those attempting to become and those who are preg-
nant due to teratogenic effects.

Most patients with Crohn disease will require intestinal sur-
gery at some point in their life. A timely operation is important to
prevent disease-related complications (eg, intra-abdominal
abscesses, fistulae) and reduce postoperative complications. In a
meta-analysis involving 15 studies (N = 3807 patients), hypoalbu-
minemia (OR, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.36-2.75]) and preoperative steroid
use (OR, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.54-2.57]) were associated with an
increased risk of postoperative complications, such as anasto-
motic leak, intra-abdominal abscess, and enterocutaneous
fistula.48 Therefore, prompt recognition of medically refractory
disease is important to prevent prolonged steroid exposure and
worsening nutritional status, which negatively effect postopera-
tive surgical course. Although timely surgery is important,
repeated surgical procedures can result in short bowel syndrome
and dependence on total parenteral nutrition, emphasizing the
important of postoperative disease control.49 Previous surgical
procedures, penetrating disease (eg, intra-abdominal abscesses,
fistulae), and smoking are risk factors for postoperative recur-
rence and should guide postoperative medication planning.50 In a
randomized clinical trial of 297 patients with Crohn disease who
had undergone ileocolonic resection in the past 45 days, postop-
erative treatment with infliximab was associated with reduced
endoscopic recurrence (30.6 vs 60%; absolute risk reduction,
29.4% [95% CI, 18.6%-40.2%]).51 Therefore, anti-TNF therapy is
an effective option for prevention of postoperative disease recur-
rence. Patients who have active inflammation despite multiple
therapies or who require repeated surgical procedures are well
served by specialty referral for consideration of novel medications
in clinical trials.

Adverse Effects of Therapy

Patients with Crohn disease have an increased risk of intestinal
cancer, which is attributed to disease-related inflammation.52,53
The relative risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma in Crohn disease
is 31.2 (95% CI, 15.9-60.9) and of colon cancer in Crohn disease is

2.5 (95% CI, 1.3-4.7), with the risk of colon cancer related to
colonic Crohn disease.54 Therefore, colorectal cancer surveillance
is an important part of health maintenance in patients with
colonic Crohn disease (please refer to the Health Maintenance
section below for additional details). In addition, an independent
association between IBD and melanoma has also been demon-
strated, and a meta-analysis of 12 studies that included 179 indi-
viduals with melanoma showed that the risk of melanoma was
increased by almost 2-fold (relative risk, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.17-2.75])
in patients with Crohn disease.55

Patients with Crohn disease are also at risk for many
medication-related cancers, such as skin cancer and lymphoma.
The risk of nonmelanoma skin cancers (by thiopurines) and mela-
noma (by biologic therapies) are increased almost 2-fold (non-
melanoma skin cancer: OR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.66-2.05]; melanoma:
OR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.08-3.29]).56 Patients with IBD also have an
increased risk of lymphoma, attributable to thiopurines and anti-
TNF medications. Data from a national French claims registry
showed that thiopurines (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.60 [95%
CI, 1.96-3.44]) and anti-TNF medications (adjusted HR, 2.41 [95%
CI, 1.60-3.64]) were associated with a 2-fold to 3-fold increase in
risk of lymphoma when used alone and more than a 6-fold
increase when used in combination.57 The risk of lymphoma
increases with age and, in the French claims registry study, the
highest risk was observed among those aged at least 65 years.57
Hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma is a rare, but aggressive, type of
lymphoma, which is more common in young men, and the inci-
dence is increased by the use of thiopurines.58 For these reasons,
thiopurine as a maintenance medication is used less often in
young patients and older patients.

Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy after a cancer
diagnosis can generate anxiety in both patients and physicians.
When possible, gut-selective therapy, such as vedolizumab,
may be preferable. Potent chemotherapy often suppresses
the immune system and the activity of IBD for an extended
period. However, intestinal inflammation often returns. In a multi-
center cohort study, Axelrad and colleagues59 demonstrated
that 12 of 69 patients (17.4%) who were in remission at the
time of cancer diagnosis eventually had a Crohn disease flare,
and the median time to flare was 37 months. Increasing evi-
dence suggests that immunosuppressive treatment, even with
biologics, in patients with significant inflammation 3 or more
years after receiving a cancer diagnosis is associated with low
rates of new or recurrent cancer (ranging from 20.3 cases per
1000 person-years [95% CI, 15.2-26.7] to 66.0 cases per 1000
person-years [95% CI, 8.0-238.4]) and overall rates of can-
cer that are not increased compared with patients with IBD with-
out cancer.60-62

Another adverse effect of therapy is an increased risk of seri-
ous infection. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with
IBD undergo routine health maintenance and vaccination.
Patients with Crohn disease have an increased risk of pneumonia
compared with patients without IBD (151 per 10 000 person-
years vs 74 per 10 000 person-years; adjusted HR, 1.71 [95% CI,
1.62-1.80]), which leads to the recommendation for pneumococ-
cal vaccination. The risk of pneumonia is increased with immuno-
suppressive therapy, including corticosteroids (adjusted OR, 3.52
[95% CI, 3.10-4.01]) and biologic therapy (adjusted OR, 1.28 [95%

Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation
If a patient with IBD is initiating 6-mercaptopurine and
azathioprine, thiopurine methyltransferase testing should be
performed before starting therapy

If a patient with extensive ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease
involving the colon has had the disease for 8 to 10 years,
surveillance colonoscopy should be performed every
1 to 3 years

If a patient with IBD is receiving immunosuppressive therapy,
patients should be educated about appropriate vaccinations,
including annual inactivated influenza, pneumococcal
vaccination with a 5-year booster, and general avoidance of
live virus vaccines

If a patient with Crohn disease is an active tobacco smoker,
smoking cessation should be recommended and treatment
should be offered or suitable referral should be provided
at least annually

CI, 1.05-1.56])63,64 Patients with IBD are also at increased risk of
shingles compared with those without IBD (7.55 per 1000
person-years vs 3.22 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR, 1.72
[95% CI, 1.51-1.96]), and this risk is significantly increased by thio-
purines (11.73 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR, 1.47 [95% CI,
1.31-1.65]).65 For this reason, inactivated zoster vaccine is recom-
mended for patients with IBD starting this category of therapy.
Furthermore, patients with IBD often receive antibiotics, which
puts them at increased risk of C difficile colitis. This should be sus-
pected in individuals with watery diarrhea with diffuse abdominal
pain and minimal bleeding, especially if the patient reports that
the symptoms feel different than their typical IBD flare. Oral van-
comycin is preferred as first-line therapy for C difficile infection in
patients with IBD.66

Patients with IBD are at risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis, par-
ticularly if they have long-term active inflammation, and this risk is
increased by exposure to corticosteroids. Patients with more than
3 months of lifetime exposure to corticosteroids are recom-
mended to have a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan to assess
their bone density.67

Patients with Crohn disease with involvement of more than one-
third of the colon have an increased risk of colon cancer after 8 years
of disease, and regular colonoscopic surveillance with biopsies is rec-
ommended every 1 to 3 years beginning at year 8, with adjust-
ments based on family history, prior dysplasia, disease extent, dis-
ease duration, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.68 Patients with
a concurrent diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis are at higher
risk for colorectal neoplasia and should undergo annual colorectal
cancer surveillance.

In addition to cardiovascular, pulmonary, and cancer risks, smok-
ing is associated with increased incidence of Crohn disease, more
rapid recurrence of Crohn disease after surgery, increased risk of com-
plications of Crohn disease, and reduced response to anti-TNF
therapy.69 Cessation of smoking in individuals with Crohn disease
is strongly recommended.70

The American Gastroenterological Association and the
Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation have published lists of IBD quality
measures (Box 4). Many of these quality measures are for outpa-
tients and can be comanaged by gastroenterology and primary
care, such as screening for tobacco abuse and counseling patients
to quit if they are smoking, yearly inactivated influenza vaccina-
tion, pneumococcal vaccination, and assessment for bone loss
with a bone density scan in patients exposed to systemic steroids
for 3 months or more of the equivalent of 7.5 mg per day of pred-
nisone. Up-to-date vaccination status for tetanus, diphtheria,
acellular pertussis, human papilloma virus, hepatitis A and B, vari-
cella, and zoster vaccination after 50 years of age should be con-
firmed. Live vaccinations should not be given to patients cur-
rently receiving immunosuppression therapy. Killed or
recombinant vaccination alternatives are available for influenza,
zoster, polio, and typhoid (Table).67,71,72 Patients receiving thio-
purines, methotrexate, or anti-TNF medications should have
regular skin checks for skin cancer and, in women receiving thio-
purines, a yearly pap smear is recommended given the increased
risk of cervical dysplasia.

Nutrition and Diet

Many patients have questions about nutrition and concerns
about nutritional deficiencies. Nutritional deficiencies are uncom-
mon in patients with mild disease. The most common deficiencies
are iron, vitamin D, and B12 (B12 particularly in patients with exten-
sive ileal disease). It is recommended that testing for levels should
be done before supplementation with goal-directed therapy.
Many patients with moderate ileal disease have adequate absorp-
tion of oral B12. Patients who have had severe flares or have
undergone surgical procedures should ensure adequate protein
intake to support healing of the intestine and surgical wounds.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is an increasingly
recognized gastroenterological condition in which patients selec-
tively avoid certain categories of food, usually occurring in
response to food-induced symptoms.73,74 For most patients with
Crohn disease, a diverse diet is to be encouraged and food avoid-
ance should be limited. An exception is for patients with intestinal

strictures for whom a low residue diet is encouraged to limit
obstructive symptoms. For patients with significant bloating,
abdominal distention, and abdominal pain without significant
detectable inflammation, a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosac-
charides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet can
prove benefit in reducing these symptoms.75,76

Emotional Care

The emotional aspects of Crohn disease are often underrecog-
nized and undertreated. Anxiety (18%-35%) and depression
(20%-34%) are quite common77-79 in patients with Crohn disease
as patients adjust to lost opportunities and restrict their life
opportunities because of concerns about future disease flares.
The prevalence of these disorders is much higher during active
disease. Many patients choose to be childless due to medication-
related concerns or misinformation, including the perception that

there is a high risk of genetic transmission.80-82 In a study that
included 89 patients with Crohn disease, posttraumatic stress
disorder occurred in 34 patients (38.2%), most frequently in
those with difficult hospitalizations, severe symptoms, and ileos-
tomy surgery for Crohn disease.83 Increasing evidence suggests
that cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressant therapy can
be beneficial for symptomatic patients with Crohn disease.84,85

Limitations
The scope of this review was intended to provide a broad over-
view of the management of Crohn disease for an internal medi-
cine audience. Therefore, several concepts were not reviewed in
great depth, including the nuances of therapeutic drug monitor-
ing, advanced endoscopic approaches in Crohn disease (eg, chro-
moendoscopy, balloon dilation), and postoperative management
of Crohn disease. However, this article provides a breadth of
information pertinent for internists who are treating patients with
Crohn disease in collaboration with gastroenterology.

Management of Crohn Disease

Conclusions

Management of Crohn disease includes treatment with monoclo-
nal antibody therapies, immunomodulators, and surgery. The opti-

mal approach depends on patient risk stratification; patient prefer-
ence; and clinical factors, including age of onset, penetrating
complications, smoking, and severity of ulceration. Physicians should
be familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of each therapy
to best counsel their patients.
