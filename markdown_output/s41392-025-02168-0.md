Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inﬂammatory illness with heterogeneous clinical manifestations covering multiple
organs. Diversiﬁed types of medications have been shown effective for alleviating SLE syndromes, ranging from cytokines,
antibodies, hormones, molecular inhibitors or antagonists, to cell transfusion. Drugs developed for treating other diseases may
beneﬁt SLE patients, and agents established as SLE therapeutics may be SLE-inductive. Complexities regarding SLE therapeutics
render it essential and urgent to identify the mechanisms-of-action and pivotal signaling axis driving SLE pathogenesis, and to
establish innovative SLE-targeting approaches with desirable therapeutic outcome and safety. After introducing the research
history of SLE and its epidemiology, we categorized primary determinants driving SLE pathogenesis by their mechanisms; combed
through current knowledge on SLE diagnosis and grouped them by disease onset, activity and comorbidity; introduced the genetic,
epigenetic, hormonal and environmental factors predisposing SLE; and comprehensively categorized preventive strategies and
available SLE therapeutics according to their functioning mechanisms. In summary, we proposed three mechanisms with
determinant roles on SLE initiation and progression, i.e., attenuating the immune system, restoring the cytokine microenvironment
homeostasis, and rescuing the impaired debris clearance machinery; and provided updated insights on current understandings of
SLE regarding its pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention and therapeutics, which may open an innovative avenue in the ﬁelds of SLE
management.

INTRODUCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), canonically deﬁned as an auto-
immune disorder, can be considered as a chronic inﬂammatory
illness with clinical manifestations encompassing various organs
such as the blood vessels, brain, lungs, skin, kidneys and joints due
to polymorphic biological alterations.1 It affects approximately 3.4
million people worldwide, with 400,000 individuals being newly
diagnosed each year.2,3 It most commonly occurs among women
between puberty and menopause,4 and individuals of the African
origin have a higher risk of developing SLE.5–7 According to a 2023
global epidemiology study of SLE, Poland,
the United States,
Barbados, and China showed the highest SLE incidence.2 Though
still with an unclear disease of origin, the chance of developing SLE
is believed to be associated with genetic factors, epigenetic factors,
environmental triggers, and hormonal factors.8

SLE can be diagnosed from the perspectives of disease onset
and disease activity. These can be assessed using varied types of
evaluation metrics such as the American College of Rheumatology
(ACR) criteria and the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). Besides,
SLE is typically accompanied with increased risks of developing
multiple types of comorbidities, with cancer screening being
recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism
(EULAR)9 and cerebrovascular disease being alarmed among
female SLE patients by the American Heart Association.10

SLE is caused by an autoimmune reaction involving both the
innate and adaptive immune systems, where an abnormal
immune response is directed to nucleic acid-containing cellular
particles. The over production of antibodies targeting these
nucleic acids, known as antinuclear antibodies
characteristic of SLE.8 Besides, the anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibody,
which is an auto-antibody directed against a component of the
spliceosome, is highly speciﬁc to SLE, with 20-40% SLE patients
versus approximately 1% healthy individuals carrying them.11

(ANAs),

Various types of agents have been used for SLE therapeutics,
ranging from cytokines, antibodies, hormones, inhibitors, antago-
nists, to the transfusion of fresh plasma and stem cells. Importantly,
while several drugs initially designed for treating other pathological
conditions have been shown effective in treating SLE such as the
use of
the anti-malaria agent hydroxychloroquine as a SLE
therapeutic, a plethora of medications have been reported capable
of inducing SLE. Examples of this kind include anti-arrhythmic
agents such as procainamide, broadspectrum antibiotics such as
minocycline, vasodilators such as hydralazine and methyldopa, and
antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine. These have unanimously
complicated our understandings on the appropriate therapeutics of
SLE, rendering it necessary and urgent to delve into the molecular
mechanisms driving SLE pathogenesis and classify current ther-
apeutics accordingly by their mechanisms-of-action. This may guide

BASICS OF SLE
Research history of SLE
The history of SLE can be dated back to 400 Before Christ (BC) and
divided into three periods, i.e., the classical period, the neoclassical
period, and the modern period. The classical period, cornerstoned
by Hipocrates who ﬁrstly described the possible ulcers of SLE as
identiﬁed and documented SLE as a
herpes esthiomenos,
cutaneous disorder.12 The neoclassical period witnessed the
manifestations and therapeutics of SLE. During this period,

In addition,

Ferdinand Hebra reported the facial rash associated with SLE as
a butterﬂy rash with illustrations; and Jonathon Hutchison noted
the photosensitive nature of SLE, among other milestones.
Regarding SLE therapeutics, quinine was ﬁrstly used by the
Physician Payne,
followed by the use of adrenocorticotropic
hormone and cortisone by the physician Philip S Hency, and later
hydrocortisone by Sulzberger and Witten.
the
inductive role of medications such as sulfonamides on SLE was
found during this period.12 The modern era was heralded by the
discovery of the lupus erythematosus (LE) cell (a bone marrow
phenomenon involving the phagocytosis of nuclear material by
polymorphonuclear
leukocytes) and characterized by rapid
scientiﬁc advances over the past 60 years. Before the discovery
of LE cell by Hargraves in 1948, the Wasserman test for syphilis was
used for SLE diagnosis. The use of immunoﬂuorescence for ANA
detection followed. The establishment of the murine models has
substantially advanced the scientiﬁc ﬁeld related to SLE, leading to
the discovery of the genetic predisposition of SLE by Leonhardt
and the familial association of SLE by Arnett and Shulman of Johns
Hopkins.12 Thanks to the contributions of these scientists made
along the history of SLE researches, the lifespan of SLE patients has
now been extensively extended from no longer than 5 years after
the initial diagnosis to living with illness12 (Fig. 1).

Epidemiology of SLE

women and least common among children.8 SLE most commonly

Fig. 1 History and etiological features of SLE. The history of SLE studies is divided into three periods, i.e., classical period, neoclassical period,
modern period. The classical period is characterized by ‘SLE description’, with critical events being ‘description of SLE as herpes esthiomenos
by Hipocrates’, ‘description of SLE as noli me tangere by Rogerius Grugardi & Rolando of Parma’, ‘confusion of SLE with tuberculosis by Erasmus
Wilson’, ‘description of SLE as skin disorders by Robert Willan’, and ‘differentiation of SLE from other diseases by Willan’. The neoclassical period
is characterized by ‘SLE manifestions, therapeutics, and identiﬁcation of the inductive role of some medications on SLE’, with representative
events being ‘documentation of SLE with illustrations as a butterﬂy rash by Ferdinand Hebra’, ‘identiﬁcation of the photosensitive nature of
SLE by Jonathon Hutchison’, ‘deﬁnition of the two forms of SLE, i.e., discoid and disseminated SLE by Mariz Kaposi’, ‘use of quinine b Payne and
use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisone by Philip S. Hency’,
‘use of hydrocortisone by Sulzberger and Witten’, and
‘identiﬁcaton of the inductive role of sulfonamides on SLE’. The modern period is characterized by ‘SLE diagnosis and establishment of murine
model’, with milestone events being ‘discovery of lupus erythematosus (LE) cell by Hargraves’, ‘use of immunoﬂuorescence for antinuclear
antibody (ANA) detection’, ‘use of immunoﬂuorescent microscopy for diagnosis’, and ‘establishment of murine model’, where following murine
model establishment, the genetic predisposition and familial occurrence of SLE were consecutively recognized

female/male ratio shifts from 3/1 in children to about 9/1 or even
15/1 among adults between puberty and menopause14,15 (Fig. 1).
SLE is associated with an increased risk of premature mortality
that has improved over the past 30 years,16 and the risk conveys
an ethnic-dependent difference.15,17 The development of lupus
nephritis (LN), a SLE-associated renal complication, is considered a
strong predictor of an increased mortality risk. SLE patients of
African, Chinese and Hispanic origins have shown an increased
risk of developing LN18,19 and thus enhanced mortality.18–20
Besides mortality, the disease incidence, prevalence, age-of-onset,
and morbidity of SLE also vary greatly among regions.17 For
instance, the annual incidence and prevalence rates of SLE in the
United States each varies from 2 to 7.6 and from 19 to 159 per 100
000 individuals, respectively, for people of different racial back-
grounds.5,6
the African origin,
particularly those who have migrated to America or Europe,
exhibit a higher incidence and prevalence, earlier age at the
disease-of-onset as compared with those of the north European
origin5–7 (Fig. 1). Asian have a lower regional risk of developing
SLE than people from the United States,21,22 but the prevalence of
SLE among people carrying the Chinese background has been
reported to be increasing.23 Such ethnic differences among SLE
patients may be explained by their different socioeconomic
backgrounds, distinct perceptions on the condition, varied risks of
getting infection or developing comorbidities especially cerebro-
vascular diseases, imbalanced availability of the medical resources,
and non-uniform adherence to the therapeutics.3,16,17,24

SLE PATHOGENESIS BY MECHANISMS-OF-ACTION
SLE is characteristic of increased presentation of autoantibodies
such as ANA, anti-Sm, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA)
antibody, antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies, and anti-β2-glyco-
protein (aβ2GPI) antibodies,1 which even occur years prior to the
clinical onset of SLE.25 Being the primary effectors of SLE
inﬂammation and associated damage,26 autoantibodies form
immune complexes (ICs) and deposit on multiple organs such as
kidney,
system to induce local
inﬂammation.26,27 Antibodies are produced by plasma cells (PCs)
and plasmablasts, the terminally differentiated B cells.28 As the
precursors of PCs and important antigen-presenting cells
(APCs),29,30 B cells loose tolerance to autoantigens31 and may
present them to T cells in SLE patients followed by the activation
of Th cells. Stimulated Th cells activate B cells and contribute to
their differentiation through clusters of differentiation 40 ligand
(CD40L)/CD40 interactions.32 Activated B cells move to germinal
centers (GCs) with the help of Tfh cells and follicular dendritic cells
(DCs), where B cells generating antibodies with high antigen
afﬁnity are expanded and differentiate into the memory B cells
(MBC) and antibody-producing PCs.33

Over-production of immunoactivating materials
Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines with pleiotropic roles in immune
regulation that can be categorized into type I, II, and III based on
sequence homology.34 Type I IFNs represent the largest IFN family
comprised of IFNα, IFNβ, IFNω, IFNκ, and IFNε; the type II family
includes solely IFNγ; and the type III family contains IFNλ1, IFNλ2,
IFNλ3, and IFNλ4.35 Out of the three families of IFNs, type I IFNs
play an immunomodulatory role that bridges the gap between
the innate and adaptive immune systems.35 That

expression of type I IFNs is activated on the trigger of nucleic
acids via intracellular pathways such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)-
mediated signaling; the binding of type I IFNs to their receptors

axis that leads to stimulated effectors of the innate and adaptive
systems.35–37

There has been a well-established positive association between

sensing pathways are chronically over-activated in many SLE
patients, with the pathogenesis roles of TLR7 in SLE being well-
established.42 For instance, over-activation of the cGAS-stimulator

locally and systemically, with the evidence being obtained from
both the animal model and from the clinics46 (Fig. 2).

Type I IFNs are central to the activation of both the innate and
the adaptive immune systems. Speciﬁcally, by interacting with
their receptors, type I IFNs induce signaling through the JAK/STAT
pathway followed by the transcription of IFNs-responsive genes
that encode the ‘IFN signature’ for activated immune response. On
the other hand, type I IFNs can directly activate DCs for enhanced
presentation of antigens to T cells, where T cell activation and
polarization are important to prime B cell differentiation. Activated
B cells then produce auto-antibodies that, once over-produced
without timely clearance, deposit in organs and cause tissue
damages, the process of which is facilitated by the interactions
between CD40 and CD40L40 (Fig. 2).

Skewed cytokine microenvironment
There are two types of T cells, i.e., αβ+ and γδ+ T cells, and αβ+
T cells can be further classiﬁed into CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. While
CD8+ T cells take on the cell-killing activity,47 CD4+ T cells are T
helper (Th) cells capable of promoting CD8+ T cell development
and B cell differentiation as well as antibody synthesis.48,49 CD4+
T cells can be roughly subdivided into Th1, Th2, Th17 and
regulatory T (Treg) cells, based on their distinct cytokine
proﬁlings.50 Th1 cells produce, primarily, IFNγ, interleukin (IL)12,

growth factor beta (TGFβ), IL10, IL34, IL35 etc.53,54 These cytokines

of a self-directed immune response, perturbed homeostasis of

SLE.55–59 For instance, expansion of Tfh and Tph is a prominent
feature of SLE,58 and Tfr cells can suppress B cell activation via
disrupting the recognition and interaction between Tfh cells and B
cells.55 B cells have been previously considered to be stimulated
by Th2 cells but are now considered primed by Tfh cells. Thus, Tfh
and Tph function in the Th2 linkage towards activated B cells and

Fig. 2 Mechanisms-of-action driving SLE pathogenesis via over-activating immune response. SLE predisposing factors including genetic,
epigenetic, hormonal and environmental factors can function as or induce the production of immunoreactants to trigger Toll-like receptor
(TLR) signaling in the innate immune system for enhanced generation of type I interferon (IFN), or modulate the development and maturation
of T and B cells in the adaptive immune system for over-production of auto-antibodies. Type I IFN functions as the hub bridging the innate
and adaptive immune systems. Speciﬁcally, type I IFN is produced from innate lymphoid cells (ILC), and directly triggers B cell activation to
overtly produce auto-antibodies that ultimately contribute to SLE pathogenesis. Besides producing type I IFNs, ILCs can also present antigens
to T cells via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to activate T cells that express CD40L that interacts with B cells via the CD40L-CD40

gained regulations within this framework such as the modulatory
roles of Tfh were not comprehensively covered or thoroughly
discussed here.

Besides CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, double-negative (DN) T cells (a
unique subset of T cells lacking both CD4 and CD8 co-receptors)
also play a signiﬁcant role in SLE pathogenesis. DN T cells are
formed by T lymphoid progenitor cells never traveled through
thymus, by T lymphoid progenitor cells traveled through thymus
but lack further development into CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, and by
CD4+ or CD8+ T cells with down-regulated CD4 or CD8 co-
receptor.61 DN T cells comprise 1-3% of human T cells and are of
high heterogeneity. There exists at least ﬁve DN T cell cohorts, i.e.,
helper DN, cytotoxic DN, innate DN, resting DN, and intermediate
DN.62 DN T cells may be pro-inﬂammatory such as IL17-producing
DN T cells63 and anti-inﬂammatory such as IL10-producing DN
T cells.64 The roles so far reported on DN T cells in SLE are largely
pro-inﬂammatory. Speciﬁcally, the amount of DN T cells was
considered to be positively correlated with SLE activity;65,66 DN
T cells conveyed a positive impact on B cell-mediated antibody
production by stimulating the release of IL4, IL17 and IFNγ;67 and
enhanced DN T cell apoptosis as a result of inhibited neddylation
attenuated lupus progression in murine models.66 Though the
signiﬁcance of DN T cells in SLE pathogenesis is not negligible,
they are exempted from the focus of this section given the shared

cytokines (such as IL4, IL17 and IFNγ) they produce with different
CD4+ T subsets, complex functional plasticity (having both helper
and cytotoxic DN cohorts) and small percentage.

Th1/Th2 imbalance. Cytokines produced by Th1 cells are largely
pro-inﬂammatory, and those generated by Th2 cells are primarily
anti-inﬂammatory.68 Numerous evidence has suggested that abnor-
mal T cell differentiation to Th2 dominance can lead to B cell hyper-
activation that contributes to immune disorders including SLE
pathogenesis.51 The selective development of Th1 and Th2 cells is
primarily driven by the cytokine microenvironment among other
inﬂuential factors such as antigen dose, afﬁnity of antigens, major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes and co-stimulatory
factors. Among other cytokines, IL12 and IL4 dictate the fate of Th
cells to the Th1 or Th2 linkage, respectively. While IL12 drives Th1 cell
differentiation through STAT4 signaling that leads to up-regulated
IFNγ and down-regulated IL4/IL5 for ampliﬁed Th1 proliferation, IL4
induces Th2 clonal expansion through STAT6 that results in up-
regulated levels of IL4/IL5 and down-regulated IFNγ expression for
augmented Th2 differentiation (Fig. 3).69

Fig. 3 Mechanisms-of-action driving SLE pathogenesis via skewing cytokine microenvironment. On antigen presentation to CD4 + T cells
through T cell receptor (TCR) by innate lymphoic cells (ILC) via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) from the innate immune system,
CD4+ T cells are activated and can differentiate into distinct T cell subsets such as T helper 1 (Th1), T helper 2 (Th2), T helper 17 (Th17) and T
regulatory (Treg) cells, the direction of which is dictated by the cytokine milieu of the microenvironment. Speciﬁcally, when IL12 is enriched in
the environment, T cells favor Th1 polarization, the process of which involves STAT4 signaling that leads to up-regulated IFNγ and down-
regulated IL4/5; when IL4 is enriched in the milieu, T cells are triggered for Th2 clonal expansion via STAT6, resulting in up-regulated IL4/5
expression and down-regulated IFNγ level. On the other hand, IL23, among others, drives T cell plasticity towards Th17 phenotype, the
process of which involves STAT3 signaling; and IL2, out of other cytokines, inhibits Th17 generation but promotes Treg generation, where
STAT5 plays a role. The balances between Th1 and Th2 cells dictates the preference towards cell
immunity,
respectively, as regulated by IFNɤ and IL4/5, respectively. The homeostasis between Treg and Th17 cells determines whether the system goes
for immune tolerance (that can cause chronic infectious diseases including cancers) or immune activation (that can lead to the pathogenesis
of autoimmune diseases including SLE), as regulated by TGFβ, IL10 (among other cytokines produced by Treg cells) and by IL17A, IL17F, IL22
(out of other cytokines generated by Th17 cells). These subsets of CD4+ T cells cross-regulate among themselves. In particular, Th1 and Th2
cells suppress the expression of each other, Treg cells reduce the levels of Th1, Th2, Th17 cells, and activates that of CD4+ T cells. Only

immune tolerance, reduced levels or activities of which are tightly
associated with the onset and progression of SLE74–76 (Fig. 3).

The subsets of Th17 cells and Tregs have distinct metabolic
patterns. While Th17 cells are mainly powered by glycolysis, the
energy supply of Tregs largely relies on fatty acid oxidation and
oxidative phosphorylation.77 Accordingly, glycolysis deprivation
was found to impair Th17 cell differentiation but support the
growth of Tregs;78–81 and impaired fatty acid oxidation was
associated with increased Th7 cell linkage yet diminished Tregs
development.82 Thus, switching energy supply from relying on
carbohydrates to lipids (low-carb or ketogenic-diet) may be a
dietary recommendation for SLE patients.

Impaired debris clearance machinery
The pathogenesis of SLE is associated with the failure of removing
self-reactive clones of T and B cells. Under normal conditions, an
immune response against self-antigens (i.e., anergic responses)
can be suppressed by the immune system; however, when this
debris clearance machinery is impaired, the ICs (comprised of, e.g.,
nucleic acids, nucleic acid-binding proteins, autoantibodies
directed against those components) may form and initiate the
inﬂammation and organ damage; perpetuation of
onset of
damage occurs when the ICs further ampliﬁes the immune
system followed by the trigger of downstream signals that induce
pro-inﬂammatory mediators such as IFNα, leading to or aggregat-
ing the pathogenesis of SLE.

The complement system is centered at the core of the immune
system mediating a cross-talk between the innate and adaptive
immune responses. The complement system has been implicated
in diverse biological processes in mammals including, e.g.,
modulation of the immune tolerance, and autoimmune diseases.

Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy

 (2025) 10:102

Dynamic homeostasis between the activation and inhibition of the
complement system is required to maintain human health. While
hyper-activated complement system may lead to excessive
inﬂammation and tissue damage, hypo-activation of the comple-
ment machinery may impair debris clearance and lead to
autoimmune disorders including SLE83 (Fig. 4).

The complement cascade is activated to initiate the proteolytic
cleavage of complement proteins into fragments that relay signals
to neighboring cells and leukocytes by being deposited onto the
targets or released into the extracellular ﬂuid. There are three
to activate the complement
mechanisms, so far elucidated,
i.e., the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways.83 In
system,
the classical pathway, the complement system is triggered by the
binding of the antibody complexes to C1q of the C1 complex. In
the alternative path, the complement system is activated via
spontaneous hydrolysis of C3. In the lectin pathway, the system is
stimulated via the binding of foreign carbohydrate moieties to
mannose binding lectin (MBL) or ﬁcolin. All pathways converge to
the generation of C4b2a or C3bBb, the cleavage of C3, and the
ampliﬁcation loop. C3b, cleaved from C3, then promotes the
formation of C4b2a3b in the classical/lectin pathways or C3bBb3b
in the alternative pathway. C4b2a3b or C3bBb3b activate C5 to
form the membrane attack complex (MAC) that takes on the
action through direct lysis of the target cells. Perturbed activation
or availability of any part of this cascade may impair immune
homeostasis and lead to severe clinical syndromes such as SLE. For
instance, over-expression of complement C3 has been associated
with promoted gastric cancer progression via activating JAK2/
STAT3 signaling84 (Fig. 4).

Besides the complement system, other mechanisms also exist
for debris clearance. For instance, marginal zone macrophages

complement cascade for debris clearance,
In the classical and lectin pathways, the
complement system is triggered by the binding of the antibody complexes to C1q of the C1 complex and the binding of foreign carbohydrate
moieties to mannose binding lectin (MBL) or ﬁcolin, respectively, which converge to the cleavage of C4 to C4b and C4a followed by the
generation of one C3 convertase, i.e., C4b2a. In the alternative path, the complement system is activated via spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 into
C3b and C3a by the convertase C3(H2O)Bb followed by the formation of another C3 convertase, i.e., C3bBb. Under the cleavage of C4b2a or
C3bBb, C3 becomes C3b and C3a. Following this, C3b binds to C4b2a or C3bBb to form C4b2a3b or C3bBbC3b which are C5 convertases
capable of hydrolyzing C5 into C5b and C5a; and C5b can initiate the cascade of forming the membrane attack complex (MAC) capable of
generating pores in the membranes of pathogens or targeted cells. While C3 activation fragments such as C3b participate in the cleaning of
cellular debris to avoid overt activation of the immune system that is favorable for halting SLE pathogenesis, overt production of MAC may
promote SLE pathogenesis via causing cell death and generating more immunoreactants

DIAGNOSIS OF SLE
Disease onset
SLE is highly heterogeneous with variable distinct clinical
manifestations, and the disease severity varies from mild to
moderate and to severe. For instance, skin inﬂammation might be
restricted to malar rash in one individual but involve upper
extremity and trunk as well in another.

The diagnosis of SLE is challenging as no consensus has been
made on the diagnostic criteria that needs to be of both a high
speciﬁcity and a high sensitivity.85 Currently, SLE is diagnosed by
both clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations, where
SLE manifestations can be deﬁned by the presence of both
subjective and objective ﬁndings, as well as laboratory examina-
tions. Subjective observations include, e.g., headaches, chest
pains, and arthralgias. Objective documentations include, e.g.,
electrocardiographic or echocardiographic conﬁrmation of cardiac
comorbidities. Lab tests include, e.g., autoantibody detection,
functional test and imaging.8

The 1997-version ACR classiﬁcation criterion has been canoni-
cally used for SLE diagnosis,86,87 with the classiﬁcation indexes
used being malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers,
renal disorder,
non-erosive arthritis, pleuritis or pericarditis,
neurological disorder, hematological syndrome,
immunological
evidence, and positive ANA.
In the clinical practice, malar rash
refers to erythema over the malar eminences that tends to spare

occurred or cellular casts were present in urine including red
blood cells or hemoglobin; neurological disorder primarily refers
to seizures or psychosis; hematological disorder
hemolytic anemia with reticulocytosis, leukocytopaenia, lympho-
cytopaenia, or thrombocytopaenia; immunological evidence refers
to the presence of anti-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) autoantibody,
anti-Sm autoantibody, or aPL autoantibodies; and positive ANA is
deﬁned as abnormal presence of ANA.8 These 11 indexes were
updated in the 2019 EULAR/ACR classiﬁcation criterion, with
‘fever’,
‘low
complement levels of C3 and/or C4’ being included, and ‘malar
rash’ and ‘photosensitivity’ being removed. In addition, positive
ANA was considered as an entry criterion for SLE characterization
and a weighted system was used to assess the clinical and
immunological manifestations of SLE in the 2019 EULAR/ACR
classiﬁcation criterion.88,89 Though speciﬁcities of these two ACR
versions remain similar (i.e., 93%), the sensitivity of the 2019-
version improved from 83% to 96% as compared with the 1997-
version88 (Table 1).

‘autoimmune hemolysis’,

‘non-scarring alopecia’,

The ACR criteria have been considered to be more feasible for
classifying advanced SLE patients. This is because that the 1997-
version requires the presence of no less than four items and the
2019-version requires even more indexes, as well as the fact that
the symptoms accrue as the disease progresses.87,88,90

It is worth noting that the ACR criteria include the most
prevalent manifestations but not all. For instance, the mucocuta-
neous manifestations included in the ACR criteria focus on discoid
lupus and oral ulcers that do not cover other skin symptoms such
as subacute cutaneous lupus, psoriasiform, and other forms of
chronic cutaneous lupus; clinical syndromes from the neurological
system is poorly represented in both the 1997 and 2019 versions
of the ACR criteria that lack other important manifestations such
as organic brain syndrome and cerebrovascular accident.91 Other
SLE classiﬁcation criteria also exist such as the Systemic Lupus
International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criterion that overcomes
issues faced by the ACR criterion such as the lack of cutaneous
and neuropsychiatric manifestations92 (Table 1). However, the

prevalent for SLE diagnosis. However, to enable accurate diagnosis
of SLE with only a few indexes is challenging due to the extreme
heterogeneous nature of this disease regarding its diversiﬁed
clinical manifestations. One possibility would be to use molecular
markers that requires in-depth understandings on SLE pathogen-
esis and identiﬁcation of the leading signaling axis or panel of
molecules marking the initiation and/or progression of SLE.
Speciﬁcally, stratifying the pathogenic process of SLE into vital
stages and identifying markers characterizing each phase may
clearly mark the disease cause and activity of an individual on
diagnosis. This may not only aid in the therapeutic design for
precision medicine despite the heterogeneity nature of
this
disease, but also enable early diagnosis as markers are grouped
by the stages following the line of disease initiation and
progression.

Disease activity
Assessment of SLE activity conveys signiﬁcant clinical values as it
is a prognostic factor associated with mortality.93 However,
accurate SLE activity measure is challenging due to the multi-
faceted clinical manifestations SLE possess and its extreme
variation features over time.

Multiple indexes have been developed to assess the activity of
SLE from multiple dimensions. The Systemic Lupus Activity
Measure (SLAM) is a scale developed to assess the disease activity
of SLE, which comprises items across 11 organ systems but does
not require immunological test results and can be scored based
solely on the physician’s clinical examination, making it applicable
in areas where laboratory testing is limited. SLAM has a relatively
satisfying high sensitivity and is currently widely used around the
world.94 The SLEDAI95 together with its updated versions85,91,96
have been used to describe the overall burden of SLE. The
Adjusted Mean SLEDAI-2000 (AMS) has been developed to
measure the disease activity over time.97 However, SLEDAI and
it updated versions have limitations in detecting clinically mean-
ingful changes in the disease activity, as only complete remission
but not partial improvement of the disease status can be captured
using SLEDAI. Thus, SLE disease activity score (SLE-DAS) has been
established accordingly to overcome such obstacles, which has
displayed a desirable sensitivity for assessing alterations in disease
activity.98 The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) criteria
and revisions99–101 are organ-speciﬁc indices assessing the partial
improvement of SLE activity that can be used alone or as part of a
composite index such as the BILAG-based Composite Lupus
Assessment (BICLA).102 BICLA is integrated from BILAG, SLEDAI
and Physician Global Assessment (PGA),103,104 which can compre-
hensively evaluate the beneﬁts of an individual patient from a
the
particular
medical resources,105 and thus has been adopted by several
clinical trials.106–110 Similarly, the SLEDAI-2000 Responder Index-
50111 and composite indices such as the SLE Responder Index
(SRI)112 are also available for assessing partial SLE improvement.
The SLICC ACR Damage Index (SDI) has been developed to
measure the accumulated organ damage ever since the disease
onset,113 which has been shown to be a reliable114 independent
outcome measure115 as well as a predictive index on future
damage accrual and mortality.116 In addition, lupus low disease
activity (LLDAS) has been used to describe prolonged disease
remission or a serologically active (i.e., high anti-dsDNA antibody
or low levels of complements) but clinically quiescent period
among SLE patients.117 Therapeutically, patients during the LLDAS
phase do not need speciﬁc treatment but
require close
surveillance118,119 (Table 1).

therapeutic towards an efﬁcient utilization of

Disease comorbidities
As a direct result of SLE or a consequence of SLE medications such
as glucocorticoids, SLE patients are at a high risk of developing
several comorbidities. Thus, surveillance using measurements of

each type of comorbidity should be adopted to prevent SLE
patients from developing these diseases, which is crucial to their
early identiﬁcation and the prevention/intervention of these SLE-
associated disorders among these patients.

Primary SLE comorbidities include cancers such as hematolo-
gical malignancies, cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclero-
sis, bone diseases such as osteonecrosis, and neuropsychiatric

associated with an increased risk of developing cancers, especially
breast cancers, cervical cancers, hematological cancers, and lung
cancers,120 with cancer screening being recommended for SLE
carriers by the EULAR.9 SLE has been considered as a risk factor for
atherosclerosis and been incorporated into the American Heart
Association guidelines for cerebrovascular disease prevention
among women.10
In addition, coronary artery disease was
documented in 6-11% SLE patients, and subclinical carotid plaque
was reported in 30-50% SLE carriers.121 SLE patients are at a high
risk of developing osteonecrosis and osteopenia. Speciﬁcally, the
incidences of osteoporosis and osteopenia occur in 1.4-68% and
25-74% SLE patients, respectively.122 Besides, SLE-related factors
such as disease activity and medication use have been reported to
be risky for developing low bone mineral density.122 Cognitive
impairment occurs in up to 88% neuropsychiatric SLE123 that
requires early diagnosis and appropriate interventions to prevent
its long-term damage accumulation. Thus, there is an urgent need
of standardized metrics for identifying cognitive impairment that,
however, is lacking.124

RISK FACTORS OF SLE
Risk factors of SLE can be classiﬁed into intrinsic and extrinsic
levels, with intrinsic factors being further grouped into those
levels, and
occurring at the genetic, epigenetic and hormonal
extrinsic factors classiﬁable into environmental factors, habits,
physiological factors and phycological factors. Before going into
details of each type of SLE risk factors, it is worth to note that
factors predisposing the risk of developing SLE is multifactorial
that can not be explained solely by information from any of these
layers, and risk factors from multiple levels can synergize to
predispose the onset and severity of SLE. As examples, increased
risks of developing SLE have been observed when genetic risk
factors interact with smoking,125 and when the risk allele of the
gene encoding chymotrypsin-like elastase family A member 1
(CTYP24A1) is coupled with insufﬁcient vitamin D supply.126

While we focus more on intrinsic factors in this section and go
into details of those at the genetic, epigenetic and hormonal
levels to gain insights for
intrinsic SLE predisposition, we
emphasize extrinsic factors in the following section to identify
preventive approaches for practical advice.

Genetic factors predisposing SLE
SLE is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic disposition.
Approximately 5-12% of people having one of his/her ﬁrst-degree
relatives carrying SLE will develop this disease in their lifetime.127
A series of landmark familial linkage studies and genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) in SLE have greatly advanced our
understanding regarding the genetic basis of SLE.128–130 Currently,
more than 100 SLE susceptibility loci have been consecutively
identiﬁed (mostly from the European and Asian populations),
which can explain up to 30% of SLE inheritability.131–134

Being a multigenic disease, several weighted genetic risk scores
(GRS) have been established to assess the cumulative genetic
susceptibility of an individual to SLE,125 with a higher GRS being
associated with an earlier SLE onset and a higher disease
activity.135 Male SLE patients, in general, have higher GRS than
female carriers,
implicating that the genetic factors play more
dominant roles among males than females in predisposing SLE
susceptibility.136

Genetic factors predisposing the incidence of SLE include both
high-risk rare mutations and high-frequency polymorphisms
(SNPs) that aggregate to collectively enhance the susceptibility
of an individual to SLE. Of note, though each conveying a small
effect on SLE risk by itself, low-frequency SNPs, once aggregated
in a sufﬁcient amount, may deliver substantial
impact on SLE

susceptibility.137 Genetic alleles so far
distributed in genes participating in IFN-relayed signal transduc-
tion, genes encoding components of the MHC region and altering
the threshold for activating T/B lymphocytes, and genes encoding
elements of the complement system such as C2, C4, C1q that
impair the clearance of cellular debris.129,137–139 Genetic factors
predisposing SLE susceptibility can be classiﬁed into three
categories according to the molecular mechanisms they may
participate in,
i.e., stimulating the immune system, skewing
immune regulatory signals, and impairing the debris clearance
machinery.

type I

Genetic factors associated with stimulated immune response. A
large number of SLE-associated SNPs have been mapped to genes
encoding proteins regulating or in response to type I IFNs such as
genetic variants of IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 5 and IRF7.140 These
SLE-associated genes are known as the ‘IFN signature’ actively
participating in the innate immune response, and SLE patients
possessing high levels of IFNα are inclined to manifest more
severe disease syndromes.141 Mechanically,
IFNs are
produced in response to foreign material invasion for promoted
maturation of DCs and production of proinﬂammatory cytokines,
leading to, e.g., stimulated Th1 polarization and B cell activation.
IRF5, being one member of the IFN signature with critical roles in
regulating type I
IFN-responsive genes, conveys a modest
contribution to SLE risk (with the odds ratio being 1.5) and is
considered to be the most strongly SLE-associated gene outside of
MHC.142 As one example of SNPs of this kind, rs12537284 was
identiﬁed through GWAS followed by meta-analysis and candidate
gene investigations.143 STAT4 has recognized as a susceptibility
gene of SLE that carries an additive value with IRF5 for increased
risk of developing SLE.144 Accordingly, SNP risk variants rs3821236,
rs3024866, rs7574865, being associated with high levels of STAT4
expression, conferred increased sensitivity to IFNα signaling in the
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SLE patients and
displayed earlier disease onset and more severe disease syn-
dromes.145 Besides IRF5, SNPs associated with genes encoding
other type I IFNs such as rs4963128 of IRF7146 and rs116440334 of
IRF8147 have also been implicated in IFN pathways. Several other
genes have also been identiﬁed capable of
inﬂuencing IFNα
signaling and the innate immune response. These include, e.g.,
IRAK1 (encoding IL1 receptor-associated kinase 1) that can be used
to explain the female-predominance feature of SLE,148 and OPN
(encoding osteopontin) that is associated with early SLE onset.149
In addition, SNPs residing in the genetic elements of microRNA
(miRNA) critical for relaying IFN signals have been character-
ized.150 For instance, rs57095329, located in the promoter region
of miRNA-146a, has been found to be highly associated with SLE
susceptibility.150 Speciﬁcally, individuals carrying the risky G allele
exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced level of miRNA-146a than those
carrying the protective C allele; and this may be attributed to the
altered binding afﬁnity of the transcription factor (TF) ETS proto-
oncogene 1 (Ets-1) to the promoter region of miRNA-146a as a
result of this genetic polymorphism.150

Genetic factors associated with immune signal
relay. Another
important portfolio of genetic risk factors predisposing SLE
development are located in genes associated with the MHC
especially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 in the MHC class II
region.151 HLA molecules play vital
in auto-antibody
production, as risk residues associated with the production of
characteristic auto-antibodies (i.e., DRB1 residues 11, 13, 30) being

more, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 form the most
haplotype, and seven residues (i.e., HLA-DRB1 residues 13, 11,
37, HLA-DQB1 residue 37, HLA-DPB1 residue 35, HLA-A residue 70,
and HLA-B residue 9) collectively increase the explainable
heritability of SLE due to HLA to 2.6%.152 Many other genes with
essential roles in relaying signals downstream of activated T and B
cell surface antigen receptors in the adaptive immune response
and auto-antibody production have also been linked to SLE
susceptibility.153,154 For instance, risky alleles of SNPs rs2230926
(TNFAIP3 that encodes TNFα induced protein 3),155 rs2476601
(PTPN22 that encodes protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor
type 22),156,157 rs7829816 (LYN that encodes lymphocyte-speciﬁc
protein tyrosine kinase),158 rs10513487 (BANK that encodes B cell
scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats),153 rs7812879 (BLK that
encodes B-cell receptor-associated protein kinase),159 rs340630
(AFF1 that encodes AF4/FMR2 family member 1),160 rs4810485
(CD40),161 rs3433034 (CSK that encodes C-terminal Src kinase),162
rs17849502 (NCF2 that encodes neutrophil cytosolic factor 2),163
rs1057233 (PU.1 that encodes purine rich box-1)164 have been
reported to alter T and/or B cell activation threshold in the

Genetic factors associated with debris clearance ability. As the
classical pathway activating complement signaling may help
remove apoptotic and damaged cells as well as ICs for reduced
risk of developing autoimmunity to nuclear components,165 low
copy numbers of C4 and C1q or deﬁciency of these genes are
typically associated with increased SLE incidence.
It has been
estimated that the chance of developing SLE among individuals
harboring congenital genetic deﬁciencies of C4 increased up to
90%.127 Several genetic mutations associated with the comple-
ment genes have been documented. For example, the C4A-null
allele was associated with a doubled SLE susceptibility than either
HLA-B8 or HLA-DR3,166 where HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 alleles were
known to predispose the risk of SLE via inﬂuencing early stages of
adaptive immune activation.167 C1qA gene deﬁcient mice have a
greater chance of accumulating apoptotic bodies in the kidney
and developing auto-antibodies to nuclear antigens.168 Also, C1q
was shown protective against SLE via directing the immune
stimulatory complexes to monocytes rather than DCs that secrete
the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine IFNα,169 and through modulating
CD8+ T cell mitochondrial metabolism for
reduced immune
response to self-antigens.170 In addition, multiple high-frequency
low-risk genetic polymorphisms residing in 1q36 have been linked
to genes encoding components of the complement system and
been considered responsible for debris clearance.171–173

Epigenetic factors predisposing SLE
Epigenetic factors predisposing SLE include, primarily, miRNA,
DNA methylation, and histone modiﬁcation.

miRNA. miRNAs can act similarly as the TFs or interplay with TFs
target genes.174
to cooperatively regulate the expression of
Numerous studies have demonstrated the biological and clinical
relevance of miRNAs in SLE. For
instance, 42 differentially
expressed miRNAs were identiﬁed from the PBMCs of SLE patients,
among which 7 miRNAs (i.e., miRNA-10a, miRNA-130b, miRNA-134,
miRNA-146a, miRNA-31, miRNA-95, miRNA-99a) were more than 6
folds lower in the diseased group as compared with the control.175
4 miRNAs (i.e., miRNA-371-5p, miRNA-423-5p, miRNA-638, miRNA-
663) and 1 miRNA (i.e., miRNA-1224-3p) were found to be up- and
down-ward regulated, respectively,
in LN cells from a study
investigating the miRNA proﬁles of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-
infected B cells and frozen PMBCs from LN patients and
unafﬂicted controls of different racial groups (i.e., American of
African and European origins).176 While being up-regulated in this

study, miRNA-423 and miRNA-663 were reported to be down-
regulated in another study examining the miRNA proﬁles of
kidney biopsy specimen, where 66 miRNAs were identiﬁed
differentially expressed in LN cells.177 Focusing on T and B
lymphocytes,
it was reported that 3 miRNAs (i.e., miRNA-21,
miRNA-25, miRNA-106b) were up-regulated in both T and B cells
of SLE patients, 8 miRNAs (i.e., let-7a, let-7d, let-7g, miRNA-148a,
miRNA-148b, miRNA-196a, miRNA-296, miRNA-324-3p) and 4
miRNAs (i.e., miRNA-15a, miRNA-16, miRNA-150, miRNA-155)
showed altered expression in solely T and B cells of SLE patients,
respectively, from a study analyzing the expression of 365 miRNAs
in PBMCs from 34 SLE patients and 20 healthy individuals.178
Another group reported 11 miRNAs differentially expressed in
CD4+ T cells from SLE patients, out of which 6 (i.e., miRNA-1246,
miRNA-126, miRNA-1308, miRNA-574-5p, miRNA-638, miRNA-7)
were up-regulated and 5 (i.e., miRNA-142-3p, miRNA-142-59,
miRNA-155, miRNA-197, miRNA-31) were down-regulated.179
Although numerous miRNAs have been found dysregulated in
human SLE patients or pre-clinical animal models, quite few
miRNAs and their altered proﬁlings were overlapping across
studies, some of which even showed inconsistent patterns. This
can be, at least, partially explained by the diversiﬁed manifesta-
tions and activities of SLE, as well as its heterogeneity regarding,
e.g., ethical race and medication history. This makes miRNAs
showing conserved alteration proﬁles among SLE patients highly
valuable from the perspectives of both diagnosis and therapeutics.

miRNA-155: promoting SLE: Multiple lines of evidence have
indicated that miRNA-155 is activated in response to the
stimulation of TLR ligands,180,181 and up-regulated miRNA-155 is
associated with activated TLR signaling. Multiple targets of miRNA-
155 have been shown with critical roles during TLR signaling. For
instance, suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS1), being a target
of miRNA-155, participated in IFN-mediated antiviral response and
thus attenuated viral propagation in macrophages.182 Inositol
polyphosphate-5-phosphatase D (INPP5D), another
target of
miRNA-155, negatively regulated TLR4 signaling in response to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.183 Myeloid differentiation
primary response protein 88 (MyD88), being targeted by miRNA-
155, acted as a vital adapter molecule in TLR signaling.184 TGF-
β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 2 (TAB2) is a direct
target of miRNA-155 that activated TLR-mediated nuclear factor
kappa B (NF-κB) in LPS-activated DCs185 and plasmacytoid DCs.186
Besides, miRNA-155 played an essential role in dictating the
antigen-presenting activity of DCs by suppressing the expression
of PU.1 and cellular oncogene fos (c-Fos), two TFs with critical
functionalities in regulating DC maturation,187 and defect DCs
were associated with attenuated immune response.188,189

miRNA-155 also modulates the cytokine microenvironment by
altering the distribution proﬁles between Th1 and Th2 cells.
Speciﬁcally, altered Th1 function, skewed Th2 differentiation, and
defective B-cell class switching were observed in mice carrying
miRNA-155 deﬁciency as a result of abnormal secretion of
cytokines such as TNFα, IL4 and IL10, and IFNγ.190,191 In addition,
miRNA-155 affects cytokine homeostasis by changing the
distribution between Th17 and Treg cells. For instance, miRNA-
155 was negatively involved in Treg cell-mediated tolerance, as
miRNA-155 depletion resulted in enhanced Treg-mediated
immune suppression;192 and miRNA-155 knockout mice exhibited
mass loss of Th17 cells coupled with marked reduction of
inﬂammatory Th17 cytokines.193

miRNA-146a: suppressing SLE: On the opposite to miRNA-155,
miRNA-146a level was negatively associated with the risk of
SLE,194 substantially down-regulated in SLE patients, and adversely
correlated with SLE activity.195,196

miRNA-146a functions as a strong negative regulator of TLR
signaling by repressing TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)

and IRAK1.197 miRNA-146a expression was inversely correlated
with TNFα production, rendering cells tolerant and cross-tolerant
to TLR stimulus.198,199 In line with these, miRNA-146a was found

IFN-β).175 Speciﬁcally,

expression, aberrant accumulation of the targeted proteins of
miRNA-146a (such as STAT1, IRF5, TRAF6, and IRAK1) led to altered
activation of the IFN pathway;175 and exogenously introducing
miRNA-146a into PBMCs from SLE patients dramatically alleviated
IFN signaling.175 The latter can be
the overtly activated type I
evidenced by the approximately 75% reduction on the transcrip-
tional levels of 3 IFN-inducible genes, i.e., IFN-induced protein with
tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (IFIT3), myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1),
and 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1).175

Similar

to miRNA-155, miRNA-146a regulates the cytokine
microenvironment by affecting both the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg
balances. Speciﬁcally, miRNA-146a was highly expressed in Treg
leading to
cells in response to T cell receptor (TCR) activation,
impaired IFNγ-dependent Th1 activity and IL2 secretion,
the
process of which involved STAT1.200,201

Other miRNAs: miRNAs modulating immune response

in TLR signaling for

Numerous evidence has supported the notion that miRNAs are
essential players
stimulating immune
response. For example, miRNA-124 suppressed macrophage
activation by repressing the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-
binding protein alpha (C/EBPα),202 miRNA-126 reduced the
expression of PU.1 and thus TLR activation in allergic asthma.203
It is noteworthy that the same miRNAs may not act uniformly
under distinct cellular contexts or pathologic conditions. For
instance, let-7i, capable of negatively regulating TLR4 expression,
was down-regulated in human cholangiocytes204 but up-
regulated in DCs in response to LPS stimulation.205

miRNAs play critical roles in the regulation of T cell develop-
ment. For example, miRNA-184 restricted the activation of CD4+
T cells during the early adaptive immune response and thus
limited the production of
IL2 by targeting nuclear factor of
activated T cells 1 (NFAT1);206 miRNA-181c showed a similar
function,
the ectopic expression of which suppressed IL2
expression and thus reduced the proliferation of activated CD4+
T cells;207 furthermore, IL2 induced the expression of miRNA-182,
leading to inhibited activity of Forkhead box O1(FOXO1) and T cell
clonal expansion.208 miRNAs also actively participate in B cell
development. For instance, miRNA-150 dramatically impaired B
cell expansion via suppressing the critical TF required for B cell
i.e., c-Myb;209 miRNA-181a promoted B cell
differentiation,
differentiation in mouse bone marrow when ectopically expressed
in B cell progenitors210 besides regulating TCR signaling in
immature T cells.211 It has been documented that transplanting
bone marrow cells over-expressing miRNA-181a to lethally
irradiated mice promoted the growth of CD19+ B cells and
reduced the amount of CD8+ T cells.210

miRNAs modulating cytokine microenvironment
Besides targeting TLR signaling pathways and regulating
immune cell development, multiple lines of evidence have
unambiguously supported the essential roles of miRNAs played
in modulating cytokine homeostasis. It has been well documented
that altered secretion proﬁles of cytokines such as IL2, IL6, IL10,
and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted
(RANTES) play crucial roles in SLE development, and miRNAs
participate in SLE development through modulating the produc-
tion of these primary cytokines. For example, the level of RANTES
was documented to be abnormally over-represented in the blood
sera of SLE patients, whereas that of IL2 was reported to be
signiﬁcantly lower in lupus T cells. Under-expressed miRNA-31
contributed to the decreased IL2 expression in PBMCs or lupus
T cells.175,179 miRNA-142-3p was highly induced in DCs in response
to LPS stimulation, leading to suppressed IL6 production.212 Up-

regulated miRNA-21 expression has been positively associated
with SLE activity, reduced level of which in SLE CD4+ T cells led to
decreased IL10 production.178 Through characterizing miRNAs
lowly expressed among SLE patients, miRNA-125a was found
capable of
reducing T cell-mediated RANTES production via
targeting its TF, i.e., Kruppel-like factor 13 (KLF13), and exogen-
ously introducing miRNA-125a into the T cells of SLE patients
resulted in signiﬁcantly alleviated up-regulation on RANTES
expression and SLE severity.213

DNA methylation. DNA methylation level has been considered to
be lower in SLE patients or lupus animal models.214,215 Speciﬁcally,
DNA extracted from the CD4+ T cells of SLE patients was
hypomethylated,215 and adoptive transfer of T cells pre-treated
with DNA methylation inhibitors induced SLE symptoms in
unirradiated syngeneic mice.216,217 A clinical study involving
1521 Chinese and European SLE patients, along with healthy
controls and patients with other autoimmune diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS),
revealed that SLE patients are characteristic of hypomethylation at
two CpG sites within the promoter region of IFI44L, SLE patients
with renal involvement displayed even lower methylation levels at
these sites, and the methylation levels increased among SLE
carriers during remission.218 These suggested that the methylation
level of the promoter region of IFI44L may serve as the blood
biomarker for SLE prognosis and diagnosis.218 In Feb 2024, the
world’s ﬁrst innovative IFI44L gene methylation detection product
was approved by National Medical Products Administration
(NMPA) of China for SLE prognosis prior to the onset of vital
organ damage.219 This may be attributable to the inhibited
inheritance of DNA methylation proﬁles during mitosis in response
to perturbations such as aging and diet220–222 that involves the
participation of multiple miRNAs such as miRNA-126, miRNA-148a
and miRNA-21.179,223


DNA methylation patterns are regulated by methyltransferases,
including DNA
(DNMT1),
(cytosine-5)-methyltransferase
DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and DNMT3L.224,225 While, DNMT1 maintains
DNA methylation proﬁles, DNMT3A and DNMT3B introduce de
novo DNA methylation, and DNMT3L assists the functionalities of
DNMT3A and DNMT3B.226,227 It has been reported that miRNAs
such as miRNA-126179 and miRNA-148a223 regulated the levels of
DMNT1 in the T cells of SLE patients. Speciﬁcally, miRNA-148a and
miRNA-21 were robustly up-regulated in CD4+ T cells from SLE
patients lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, giving rise to DNA hypo-
methylation via suppressing DNMT1 expression;223 and miRNA-
126 inhibited DNA methylation in CD4+ T cells of SLE patients by
binding to the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) of DNMT1.179 In
addition, defective ERK pathway in T cells negatively affected
DNMT1 expression and enhanced the development of anti-dsDNA
antibodies in transgenic mice,228 suggesting the involvement of
suppressed ERK signaling in priming DNA hypomethylation
among SLE carriers.

Histone modiﬁcation. Histone 3 (H3) and Histone 4 (H4)
hypoacetylation and site-speciﬁc histone methylation alterations
were found in the CD4+ T cells from SLE patients and MRL-lpr/lpr
mice splenocytes.229,230 It has been reported that the histone
deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) can restore skewed
expression of IL10, IFNγ and CD154 in lupus T cells,231 and treating
MRL-lpr/lpr mice with histone deacetylase inhibitors TSA and
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) reduced the section of
IL12, and IFNγ.232,233 These ﬁndings implicated that
IL6,
histone modiﬁcation variation contribute to the modulation of
cytokine distribution in SLE pathogenesis.

among SLE carriers. Speciﬁcally, estrogen functions by skewing
the cytokine microenvironment to favor Th2, prolactin acts via
activating the immune response. Progesterone, on the other hand,

mediated diseases including SLE by inhibiting the production of
Th1 pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as IL12, TNFα and IFNγ, and
stimulating the secretion of Th2 anti-inﬂammatory cytokines such
as IL4, IL10, and TGFβ.68

Estrogens include estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3),
with E2 being the primary biologically active estrogen. Estrogen
receptors (ERs), both nuclear and membrane bound, have been
identiﬁed in various types of cells involved in the innate and
adaptive immune responses.234 While the nuclear ERs include ERα
and ERβ,
the membrane-bound ER is the G-protein-coupled
estrogen receptor (GPER).235 ERs contain three functional domains,
i.e., trans-activation domain, DNA-binding domain, and ligand-
binding domain.236 During nuclear ER signaling, ERα and ERβ
typically act in an opposite fashion in response to E2 treatment
and regulate almost distinct sets of genes, with only 38 out of 228
genes being regulated by both ERα and ERβ.237 Nuclear ER
signaling can be long-term and manifest genomic information via
transcriptionally regulating a plethora of factors including, e.g.,
cytokines such as IFNs and signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT
signaling.234,238,239 Different from nuclear ER signaling, GPER-
mediated signaling is rapid and nongenomic. Speciﬁcally, the
signal transduction cascade is initiated via intracellular calcium
and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) induction, and leads
to activated phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/ AKT and mitogen
activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ extracellular signal regulated
kinase (ERK) signaling.235

environment to the Th2 state, where a shift of the balance
between Th1 and Th2 subsets to Th2 dominance is characteristic
of SLE. Speciﬁcally, low doses of estrogen promote Th1 responses

elevate
immune
responses.240,241 This effect of estrogens is achieved via altering

both the innate and adaptive immune responses such as
macrophages, DCs, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.239

Extrinsic factors predisposing SLE
The contribution of extrinsic risk factors to SLE susceptibility
increases with age, as a greater contribution of known SLE genetic
risk alleles (especially residing in non-HLA genes) were found
among children who developed SLE than adult SLE patients.247,248
Extrinsic trigger of SLE can be primarily classiﬁed into three
categories based on their effects on SLE pathogenesis, i.e., events
introducing immune activators, perturbing cytokine microenvir-
onment homeostasis, and inducing inﬂammation.8

Events introducing immunoreactants.
EBV infection can increase
the amount of EBV nucleic acids in the blood of SLE patients,249
which activates the innate immunity and B cell differentiation by
expressing type I
IFNs and stimulating the production of
autoantibodies speciﬁc for EBV-encoded proteins.250,251 It is worth
noting that EBV infection predisposes to SLE development but not
vice versa, as the serum anti-EBV capsid antigen IgG levels of SLE
patients were signiﬁcantly higher than healthy individuals that did
not apply to anti-EBV nuclear antigen.252 The mRNA/DNA vaccines
may also induce SLE. It has been reported that the application of
mRNA or DNA vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-
19) has been shown capable of causing new or relapsed onset of
SLE.253–256 A boost in spike protein-speciﬁc CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T
cell responses were detected after the use of AZD1222 (i.e., a DNA
COVID-19 vaccine),257
the mechanism of which could be
attributed to activated TLRs followed by induced type I
IFNs-
mediated signaling. Additionally, agonists of TLR7 and/or TLR9
have been oftenly supplemented as the adjuvants in mRNA/DNA
COVID-19 vaccines for enhanced immunity,258,259 further aggre-
gating the development of SLE.

UV light irradiation may activate the autoimmune response via
generating nucleic acid fragments, attributing to its breakage role
on DNA strands.46 A clinical study examined the sensitivities of
100 SLE patients to UV radiation, where 93% patients showed
abnormal reaction to UV and visible light including, e.g., superﬁcial
perivascular lymphocytic inﬁltrate and deposition of immunor-
eactants such as IgG and C3.260

Medications with pro-inﬂammatory roles may also induce SLE
that can be manifested as vasodilation and hypotension. For
instance, hydralazine (a vasodilator) and procainamide (an anti-
arrhythmic agent) can trigger SLE via forming neutrophil
trap (NET)261,262 that can function as the auto-
extracellular
antigens due to DNA, histones and neutrophil proteins it
contains.263 Excessive secretion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
such as IFNα (used for
treating Hepatitis B/C) aggravates
SLE.264–266

Habits such as tobacco smoking is a known risk factor for SLE in
a dose-dependent manner as it is a stimulus capable of inducing
nonspeciﬁc inﬂammation and,
thus, autoimmune responses
among SLE carriers.267

Events skewing cytokine microenvironment.
Some medications
may induce SLE, though the symptoms may be milder than
idiopathic SLE. The mechanisms-of-action may be attributed to
roles in skewing the cytokine microenvironment. For
their
instance, carbamazepine, an anticonvulsive agent traditionally
used for treating epileps and neuropathic pain, can increase
IL5 secretion that marks Th2 production, attributing to the
terminal metabolite acridine it produced.268 Sulfasalazine, used
for treating rheumatoid arthritis, can skew the cytokine micro-
environment to Th2-dominant state by suppressing IL12 produc-
tion in macrophages.269 Another example refers to antibodies
against TNFα that have been used as immunosuppressors in the
treatment of autoimmune or inﬂammatory diseases. Inﬂiximab, an
anti-TNFα antibody,
induced the production of anti-dsDNA

antibody and SLE among more rheumatoid arthritis patients.270,271
Similarly, hydralazine, procainamide and other DNA methyltrans-
ferase inhibitors such as 5-azacytidine may turn CD4+ T cells
autoreactive to spontaneously lysed syngeneic macrophages and
produce more IL4/6 and IFNγ to induce SLE.216,220 The combina-
torial use of minocycline (a semi-synthetic tetracycline-class
broad-spectrum antiboitic) with bone marrow derived mesench-
ymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
though having achieved desirable therapeutic effects in an
autoimmune encephalomyelitic mice model, may increase the
risk of developing SLE syndromes as a result of suppressed
production of IFNγ and TNFα as well as increased generation of IL4
and IL10.272 Paradoxically, minocycline decreased C-C motif
chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22) production from macrophage type
2 for reduced Th2 recruitment to the lesion,273 implicating the
importance of cytokine microenvironment homeostasis in pre-
venting autoimmune syndromes that is dictated, at least partially,
by the type and cytokine proﬁle of the syndrome as well as the
medication strategy being applied.

PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES FOR SLE MANAGEMENT
SLE could be initiated and accelerated by complicated dynamic
interplays between intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Speciﬁcally, once
individuals possessing SLE genetic, epigenetic or hormonal risk
factors are chronically exposed to extrinsic risk factors, accelerated
disease onset and deterioration may occur. As intrinsic risk factors
levels are

extrinsic risk factors in this section.

factors

such as

Extrinsic factors can be environmental situations such as virus
infection, UV light irradiation, heavy metal exposure, air pollution
factors such as unhealthy diet, cigarette
and silica, habitual
smoking,
lack of physical exercises and sleep deprivation,
physiological conditions such as comorbidities, obesity and
pregnancy, and psychological
trauma and
stress.274–276 Current conceptions on a healthy lifestyle with a
lower risk of developing SLE overall include, e.g., a healthy eating
habit (i.e., top 40% of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index), no
smoking, moderate alcohol consumption (i.e., no less than 5 gm
per day), regular exercise (performing at least 19 metabolic
equivalent hours of exercise per week), and ﬁtness (i.e., body mass
index below 25 kg/m2).277 Each of these preventive recommenda-
tions has a 19% additive value in reducing the chance of
developing SLE especially among anti-dsDNA antibody positive
patients; and the cumulative risk of having SLE can be reduced to
half of those with the poorest behavior for individuals keeping the
best adherence to the healthy lifestyle. This implicates that
extrinsic factors may act synergistically to inﬂuence the risk of SLE,
and SLE may be prevented by, e.g., altering the lifestyle among
other extrinsic factors.

Preventive strategies can be classiﬁed into three stages,
i.e.,
primary prevention, secondary prevention, tertiary prevention,
which should be adopted as early as possible to prevent the
development, exacerbation and progression of SLE, respectively.
This especially holds true for individuals who have already been
prognosed at a high risk of developing SLE or diagnosed with SLE.
Following the rationals of mechanisms-of-action, preventive
strategies can be classiﬁed into approaches against events
introducing immune stimulants, and skewing the cytokine
microenvironment (Fig. 5).

Prevention of SLE
Preventive strategies recommended below are categorized by the
pathogenic stages leading to SLE. These approaches are suitable
to individuals diagnosed with high risks of developing SLE for
prevented disease onset, and to SLE patients for alleviated disease
symptom or delayed disease progression.

Fig. 5 Risk factors and preventive strategies against SLE development, exacerbation, progression. Risk factors predisposing SLE can be
classiﬁed into intrinsic and extrinsic factors (in red). Intrinsic factors can occur at genetic, epigenetic and hormonal levels. Extrinsic factors can
be environmental, habitual, physiological and phycological. Among these extrinsic factors, SLE comorbidities from the category of
physiological factors include cancers, cardiovascular diseases, bone diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases. As intrinsic SLE predisposing
factors are difﬁcult to control, preventive strategies against each extrinsic risk factors are listed (in blue). By summarizing preventive strategies
against SLE and its comorbidities, 11 recommendations on the lifestyles (i.e., cease smoking, physical exercise, sufﬁcient sleep, mental health,
ﬁtness, High-ﬁber low carbohydrate diet, Ca2+ intake, vitamin D supply, avoid alcohol overdose, avoid environmental immune stimulants,
avoid abuse of estrogen-enriched products) and 7 advises on medication aids (avoid abuse of glucocorticoids,
immunosuppressive
therapeutics, antibiotics, aspirin, statin, virus vaccination, interventions of medicines against cognitive dysfunction) are given. SLE preventive
strategies can be classiﬁed into three stages,
i.e., primary prevention against SLE development, secondary prevention against SLE
exacerbation, tertiary prevention against SLE progression. The prevention of SLE comorbidities should start at the time of diagnosis. Applying
preventive strategies as early as possible during the disease course can help to avoid organ damage, which is a major trigger of systematic
functional decline. Primary prevention recommendations are emphasized using cartoons

It is worth to highlight that intrinsic and extrinsic factors
especially biomarkers at the genetic and epigenetic levels as
aforementioned can aid in SLE prevention and early intervention,
since they could help identify individuals with the high risk of
developing SLE that
require early adoption of prevention
strategies.

Also deserves emphasizing is that there is current no consensus
on strategies for SLE prevention given the complexity and
heterogeneity of the etiology of this disease. Besides, the full
spectrum of preventive strategies against SLE is not completely
uncovered, personalized prognosis and prevention modality
design are not yet available. Thus, approaches beneﬁcial to one
individual may not be optimal or even effective to another.

Prevention against events introducing immune stimulants. As an
important type of extrinsic factors, environmental situations with
SLE-predisposing roles such as EBV infection, exposure to UV light,
heavy metals such as mercury,278 agricultural pesticides,278–280 air
pollution, crystalline silica dust,281–284 and other
respiratory
particulates285,286
largely act via exposing individuals with
immune stimulants. These factors function primarily by stimulat-
ing cellular necrosis and secreting intracellular antigens for up-

regulated IFN levels and promoted inﬂammation. Take EBV
infection as an example, it functions by releasing EBV-encoded
small RNA from infected cells that induces type I IFN signaling (in
particular TLR3-mediated signals),287 with a substantially higher
seroprevalence of anti-viral capsid antigens IgG and antibodies
against early antigens being observed among SLE patients as
compared with non-diseased controls according to a meta-
analysis involving 25 case-control studies.252 Additionally, UVB
radiation, another important trigger of SLE, led to a signiﬁcant rise
in type I IFN signaling and prolonged activation of T cells both in
lupus-prone mice and among SLE patients.288–290 A randomized,
vehicle-controlled, double-blind clinical study including 25 CLE
patients revealed the photoprotective effects of broad-spectrum
sunscreen.291 There also exists clinical evidence supporting the
beneﬁts of using sunscreen for preventing the onset or worsening
of SLE.292 Yet it is worth noting that the association of UV radiation
with SLE risk is convolved with its positive roles in vitamin
D3 synthesis293 that may, to some extent, reduces SLE risk.294
Therefore, keeping away from immune stimulants such as virus
infection, overt UV light exposure and any environmental
pollutant is highly advised among individuals genetically predis-
posed with SLE.

autoimmune

Receiving vaccination to elevate the thresholds of responding
to environmental stimuli may represent another useful strategy.
Yet, the efﬁcacy of vaccination in reducing SLE risk remains to be
elucidated.295 This is because that vaccines may contain elements
such as molecular mimicry, auto-antibodies and adjuvants that
can potentially trigger autoimmune responses towards acceler-
ated SLE. Evidences supporting this rational include a series of
reports on the new-onset of autoimmune diseases including
autoimmune hepatitis disease,296
thrombotic
events,297 rheumatoid arthritis,298 immunoglobulin A vasculitis,299
Guillain-Barré Syndrome and,300 importantly, SLE,255,301 after
getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Also, a clinical case on the
transition of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) to SLE after
COVID-19 vaccination has been identiﬁed.302 However, these
reports are largely from case reports or cross-sectional studies
representing temporal associations and are not from vaccinations
against EBV. On the other hand, therapeutic EBV vaccines have
been considered promising in treating cancers with acceptable
toxicity.303 Take together, establishing vaccines against EBV or any
other immune stimulants for SLE prevention may be worthwhile
to try but requires intensive investigations and clinical monitoring
on the possible adverse effects accompanied besides the efﬁcacy.

Prevention against events
skewing cytokine microenvironment.
Many lifestyles and physiological conditions associated with SLE
predisposition can increase levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines,
leading to skewed cytokine microenvironment.

Cigarette smoking has been associated with increased risk of
developing anti-dsDNA antibody positive SLE than non-smokers
investigations,267,304,305 linked to augmented
by several clinical
autoreactive B cells by a clinical evidence based meta-analysis,267
and associated with induced pulmonary ANA in the lungs of
exposed mice.306 In addition, a cross-sectional study containing
105 smokers revealed the positive association of cigarette
smoking with cumulative chronic damage in SLE patients and its
deleterious effects on lupus morbidity.307 This may be attributed
to the toxic components of the cigarette that can damage DNA to
form immunogenic DNA adducts for promoted production of anti-
dsDNA antibody and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines.308,309 In parti-
cular, smoking can increase the expression of B lymphocyte
stimulator (BLyS) that is a soluble ligand of the TNF cytokine
family,306 TNFα and IL6.310 Among positive ANA women, elevated
BLyS and lower IL10 (an anti-inﬂammatory cytokine) levels were
identiﬁed among frequent smokers.311 Therefore, cease smoking
is highly recommend especially for those with genetic preposition
to SLE.

Sleep-deprivation (less than 7 h per night) has also been
associated with an earlier SLE onset and accelerated auto-
antibody production from both pre-clinical animal models and
clinical observations.312–314 In particular, from a prospective study
involving 436 participants having relatives already diagnosed with
SLE, the chance of developing SLE among individuals sleeping less
than seven hours per day was 2.8-folds of that among the rest
with statistical signiﬁcance.314 In a larger trial involving 186072
women, chronic low sleep duration (i.e., less than 5 h/day) was
associated with increased SLE risk (adjusted HR = 2.47) with
confounding factors shiftwork, bodily pain and depression being
insufﬁcient sleep has been
adjusted.315 At the molecular level,
shown to be capable of increasing levels of pro-inﬂammatory IL6
and TNFα,
leading to impaired functionalities of Treg cells,
imbalanced cytokine milieu, systematic inﬂammation and ulti-
mately endangered self-immune tolerance.278 Thus, keeping
sufﬁcient sleep (e.g., seven to eight hours per day) and avoiding
night or rotating shifts are recommended for individuals of all
ages predisposed with SLE.

In addition, both TNFα and IL6 have been

implicated with critical

roles in the modulation of
resistance.317 In a Mendelian randomization study, 3 out of 25
identiﬁed cytokines associated with obesity (i.e., CTACK, IL18 and
SCGFb) were related to SLE, and 2 out of 18 characterized
cytokines associated with SLE (i.e.,
IP10 and MIP1B) were also
linked to obesity,318 implicating the intermediary role of these
cytokines in the association between obesity and SLE. Thus,
keeping ﬁtness may be an effective preventive approach against
SLE. To avoid obesity, one might be recommended to take food
enriched with ﬁbers and/or adhere to a low-carbohydrate or
ketogenic diet that have been shown associated with reduced risk
of developing SLE via decreasing glucose-induced inﬂammation
and preventing obesity.319,320

Women who had experienced physical and emotional abuse
during childhood exhibit higher chances of developing SLE as
compared with those who had not.321,322 In an analysis of data
from 36152 black women, both physical and sexual abuse during
childhood were statistically associated with increased SLE
incidence, where other factors including alcohol consumption,
smoking, body mass index, oral contraceptive use, age at
menarche, and parental education were adjusted. The HR of
women with more than 2 episodes of sexual abuse was 2.51-folds
of the control group, implicating the signiﬁcant promoting role of
physical and emotional abuse during childhood on SLE risk.321 In
consistent with this, psychosocial trauma and associated post-
traumatic stress disorder may lead to autoimmune diseases
among women including SLE.323 In a cross-sectional analysis of
data from the California Lupus Epidemiology Study involving 242
SLE adult patients, more recent stressful events were statistically
associated with higher stress among people having trauma and
adverse childhood experiences, and positive psychosocial factors
showed an opposite association.324 These results suggested the
mitigating role of a positive mental state in perceived stress that
may improve outcomes in SLE, even among individuals suffered
from prior trauma and thus more vulnerable to recent stressful
events. Besides, depression has been recognized as an important
risk factor of SLE among females.325 In a cross-sectional study
conducted among 85 Chinese SLE patients, a robust correlation
was identiﬁed between SLE disease activity and depression that
was weakened during disease remission; besides, the presence of
mucosal ulcer signiﬁcantly increased the risk of developing
depression among these patients.326 These results supported the
negative role of depression on SLE risk. Mechanically, Th2
cytokines are generated to protect the organism from over-
production of the pro-inﬂammatory Th1 cytokines in response to
stress; under certain circumstances, stress hormones may promote
inﬂammation via inducing the production of cytokines such as IL6
and TNFα as well as through activating pathways involving
corticotropin-releasing hormone and substance P induced hista-
mine.327 The stress system, being either hyperactive or hypoactive,
may contribute to SLE pathogenesis, the process of which involves
interface between the neuroendocrine and the
an abnormal
immune systems.327 Thus, conditions associated with dramatic
changes in the stress system such as acute or chronic stress,
pregnancy and the postpartum period may potentiate SLE via
altering the Th1/Th2 cytokine homeostasis.327 These have
collectively explained the predisposing roles of emotional
depression and stress on SLE onset, and suggested the
importance of keeping the mental health among individuals at
high risks of developing SLE.

Estrogen has been considered capable of up-regulating the
expression of several genes involved in B cell activation and
survival such as those encoding CD22, Src homology 2 (SH2)

(BCL2), and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM),328 explaining
the increased SLE susceptibilities of oral contraceptive pill (with
ethinyl estradiol being the major ingredient) users and individuals

receiving hormone replacement therapy.329–331 In a two-sample
Mendelian randomization analysis of a GWAS data, a negative
causal relationship was identiﬁed between age at menarche and
SLE, suggesting the positive role of estrogen played in SLE risk
predisposition.332 Thus, reducing the use of estrogen-enriched
products is highly recommended for women with genetic SLE
predisposition.

Prevention of SLE comorbidities
SLE comorbidities should be prevented or treated, which is also of
the paramount importance as these conditions can lead to the
ultimate death in a considerable proportion of SLE patients.333
Diseases typically accompanied with SLE include neoplasms
especially hematological cancers, cardiovascular diseases, bone
diseases such as osteonecrosis, and neuropsychiatric manifesta-
tions such as cognitive dysfunction.

SLE-associated cancers can mostly be induced by virus

infection. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
has implicated virus infection as one primary etiological factor
leading to cancers that contributes to around 15% of new cancer
annual incidence. Viruses capable of inducing cancers are deﬁned
as Group I ‘carcinogenic to humans’ by IARC, which include, e.g.,
human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C
virus (HCV), EBV, Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), Merkel cell
polyomavirus (MCPyV), human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV),
human T-cell
lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV1), simian virus 40
(SV40).334–337 In particular, approximately 10% diagnosed cancer
cases are induced by virus infection, among which 4.5% are
caused by HPV infections.338

Among HPV-associated transformed conditions, high risk was
identiﬁed for epithelial carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix,
vaginal cancer, anal cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer, bladder
cancer,
lung cancer, and lymphoma especially
Hodgkin’s lymphoma.339–343 The association between HPV infec-
tion and cancer incidence has been proposed to be attributable to
the chronic immune activation triggered by persistent virus
infection and/or the inefﬁciency of the immune system to clear off
HPV infection.341 Therefore, frequent HPV screening, vaccination
following gender- and age- associated recommendations, ther-
apeutics removing immune stimulants leading to over-activated
immune responses, and medications attenuating chronic over-

Speciﬁcally,

such as the
regular gynecological screening,
Papanicolaou (PAP) test for women aged 21-30 years old every
3 years and the PAP test combined with the HPV test for women
aged 30-65 years old every 5 years, are heavily recommended.
Along with the examination, HPV vaccination is suggested among
females aged between 21 and 65.339

The traditional strategy used to remove immune stimulants
such as bacterial infections is to apply antibiotics. For instance,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole(TMP-SMX) is a combinatorial anti-
biotic used for infection treatment, which has been used as a
prophylactic agent for patients showing a low T cell activity (i.e.,
CD4+ cells below 200 cells/mm3).344 However, co-administration
of TMP and SMX is not recommended due to its notable adverse
effects especially for the increased risk for hematologic toxicity.345
In addition, treating patients carrying chronic neutropenia (below
500 cells/mm3) with quinolone antibiotic such as levoﬂoxacin
(500 mg daily) or ciproﬂoxacin (500 mg, twice daily), possibly
coupled with anti-fungal therapy as well depending on the
disease situation, has been recommended as another prophylactic
therapy.346,347

represent
Cardiovascular
another important portfolio of SLE comorbidities.
It has been
estimated that SLE patients have a 27% higher risk of developing
cardiovascular diseases as compared with gender- and age-
matched diabetes patients and over double folds the risk of the
general population.353 Among the diversiﬁed types of cardiovas-
cular events, myocardial
infarction and stroke are the most
commonly observed among SLE carriers, with the hazard ratio of
myocardial infarction among SLE patients ranging from 2.6 to 5.1
and that of stroke SLE carriers being 2.1 to 3.3.354 In addition to
the aforementioned two primary cardiovascular disorders, the
chance of developing sub-clinical atherosclerosis also increases
among SLE patients, with the atherosclerotic plaques being
detected in 25–56% young SLE carriers as compared with
17–70% of individuals from the general cohort with a similar
age range.355–357

Several SLE-associated with cardiovascular comorbidities have
been identiﬁed. These include, e.g., SLE-speciﬁc genetic risk
factors such as the IL19 risk allele associated with a 2.3-fold
increased risk of developing myocardial
infarction and stroke
among SLE carriers due to enhanced levels of IL10 and aPL
antibodies,358 physiological risk factors such as male gender,359
advanced age,359–361 and postmenopausal status,360,361 lifestyle
risk factors such as tobacco smoking,362 and medical risk factors

Several medications have been identiﬁed to be feasible for
preventing cardiovascular diseases associated with SLE. For
instance, an appropriate use of statin has been proposed capable
of helping prevent cardiovascular diseases among SLE patients
given its roles in reducing the low-density lipoprotein levels of the
patients.363 There also exists evidence supporting a dose-
dependent use of aspirin among SLE carriers especially those
having at
least one risk factor predisposing the onset of
cardiovascular diseases due to its anti-thrombotic effects.365


Systemic lupus erythematosus: updated insights on the pathogenesis,. . .
Dai et al.

Speciﬁcally, the anti-thrombotic effects of aspirin are related to its
roles in acetylating cyclooxygenase (COX) in the platelets,366 and a
low-dose aspirin regimen (i.e., over 30 mg/day) can effectively
prevent platelet aggregation without affecting the functionalities
of endothelial cells.367 Yet, a higher dosage and more frequent use
of aspirin is required to suppress inﬂammation, the primary
drawback of which is associated with increased risk of developing
gastrointestinal syndromes, renal toxicity and hypertension. Taken
together, aspirin is recommended as a secondary prevention
approach against cardiovascular syndromes associated with SLE
but remains controversial to be used for primary cardiovascular
disease prevention due to its adverse effects.368

It is important to note that several drugs commonly used for
treating SLE or certain comorbidities may induce or deteriorate
cardiovascular syndromes. For instance, glucocorticoids, capable
of dampening both the innate and adaptive immune responses,
are known to increase the glucose and cholesterol levels of the
blood as well as the blood pressure, which are all risk factors
predisposing the onset of cardiovascular disorders.369,370 Speciﬁ-
cally, several cohort investigations have demonstrated that a long
duration use of corticosteroid371,372 and a high accumulated
corticosteroid dose,372–379 are associated with a high incidence of
cardiovascular events among SLE carriers.362,380–382

Bone diseases. Bone diseases especially osteoporosis and frac-
tures frequently occur among SLE carriers, with the frequency
ranging from 3 to 40%.120,383–385 In particular, independent cohort
studies conducted in Taiwan, Sourth Korea, and USA all reported
higher incidences of osteoporotic fractures among SLE patients as
compared those non-SLE carriers, with the incidence ratio being
1.63 versus 0.92,386 19 versus 6.5,387 and 4.32 versus 2.4,388
respectively, per 1000 persons per year.

Several risk factors have been alluded to increase the chance of
developing osteonecrosis among SLE patients, with the most
prominent one being the medicinal use of corticosteroids. It has
been recognized that osteonecrosis primarily occurs among SLE
patients who have received corticosteroid treatment but not those
who have not.389 Besides, the prevalence of osteonecrosis among
SLE is much higher than in other diseases requiring the use of
corticosteroids.390 Lots of clinical evidence have implicated that
the initial dose, cumulative dose, tapering speed, and treatment
duration of corticosteroids, as well as medications used together
with corticosteroids all convey signiﬁcant impact to the incidence,
number, volume and location of osteonecrosis.390 Thus, avoiding
the use or overt dosage of corticosteroid represents an effective
strategy for keeping bone health.

Habits such as alcohol abuse and smoking all impose signiﬁcant
negative impacts on the onset of SLE-associated osteonecro-
sis.391–393 Alcohol
intake is associated with induced chronic
inﬂammation,
impaired bone cell differentiation, and increased
adipogenesis, which collectively lead to the development of
including osteonecrosis.394 Smoking is capable of

to prevent

Lastly, accumulated evidence have implicated that SLE activity
is of the paramount importance in predisposing osteonecro-
sis.397–401 Several clinical studies have supported the positive
correlation between the SLEDAI score and the chance of
developing osteonecrosis.398,402 Several genetic polymorphisms
affecting SLE activities have been identiﬁed to be positively
associated with the risk of developing osteonecrosis. For example,
three SNPs from the Korean population (i.e., rs3813946, rs311306,

rs17615)403 and one SNP from the Chinese population (i.e.,
rs45573035)404 residing in the gene encoding the complement
receptor type 2 (CR2) have been reported to be associated with
the susceptibility of osteonecrosis. CR2 is a membrane glycopro-
tein that binds to the degradation debris of C3 and plays critical
roles in relaying immune signals such as activating B cells via
cooperating with the B cell receptors.403,405 Genetic defects in CR2
may lead to impaired debris clearance ability and abnormal B cell
signaling, which are both promotive on SLE activity. Another
example is that the T/T genotypes from the C1236T and C3435T
polymorphisms of the gene encoding the adenosine triphosphate
(ATP)-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) show
protective roles against osteonecrosis as compared with the
wildtype (C/C) genotypes, where ABCB1 functions by pumping
foreign substances out of cells and is lowly expressed among SLE
patients.406–408 In summary, reduced level of ABCB1 is associated
with cells’ decreased ability of removing immune stimulants and
consequently increased SLE activity and elevated risk of develop-
ing osteonecrosis. Thus, adopting preventive strategies against
SLE is highly recommended here for maintaining the bone health.

Neuropsychiatric diseases. Neuropsychiatric disorders,
ranging
from overt neurological syndromes such as psychosis and seizures
to subclinical conditions such as mood disorders and cognitive
dysfunction (deﬁned as a signiﬁcant defect in attention, memory,
reasoning, execution, visual-spatial processing, and
language,
psychomotor speed409),
type of SLE
represent an important
comorbidities. Among these varied disease manifestations,
cognitive dysfunction has the highest prevalence, with up to
50% SLE patients carrying overt neurological syndromes being
accompanied with varied degrees of cognitive dysfunctions.410
The overall prevalence of cognitive dysfunction varies between
3% and 88% among SLE patients411–414 due to the lack of
consensus in screening tools and validated markers for identifying
cognitive dysfunctions, difﬁculty in associating cognitive dysfunc-
tions with SLE, and heterogeneity regarding the severity and
cohort intrinsic feature of SLE patients.410,415–419 Clinically, only
3-5% SLE patients carry severe cognitive dysfunctions, and the
degrees of the cognitive syndromes of most patients are mild-to-
moderate following a benign course.420

Conventional neuroimaging have shown that, although varying
signiﬁcantly among individuals, cognitive dysfunctions primarily
display periventricular hyperintensities and cerebral atrophy.421
The pathogenesis of SLE-related cognitive dysfunctions are
considered to be caused by the access of peripherally produced
neurotoxic auto-antibodies to the central nervous system, the
process of which involves the breach of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB).422 Therefore, neuropsychiatric disorders can be roughly
considered as a manifestation of cardiovascular syndromes
commonly occurred among SLE carriers in the brain system,
leaving risk factors predisposing the development of neuropsy-
chiatric and cardiovascular diseases associated with SLE similar.
factors that are difﬁcult to manage by
Besides physiological
nurture, the negative impacts of some lifestyles and medical
predisposing factors of cardiovascular comorbidities should be
removed to keep the mental health of SLE carriers. These include
the avoidance of smoking423 and abused use of glucocorticoids as
aforementioned. Of note is that both long- and short- term
application of glucocorticoids for SLE control have been shown
capable of worsening cognitive dysfunction among SLE patients
by several clinical studies.424 For instance,
long-term use of
moderate doses of prednisolone led to reduced cognitive
ﬂexibility and decision-making ability of SLE patients;425 a daily
use of prednisolone for over 9 mg worsened the mathematical
processing ability of SLE patients with SLE;426 short-term applica-
tion of high-dose glucocorticoid resulted in hippocampal atrophy
and declarative memory defects.427 The mechanistic impact of
glucocorticoids on the cognitive system of SLE patients can be

attributed to the interactions of these agents with the neuronal
receptors distributed in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and
basolateral amygdala, which lead to impaired memory and
learning activities.428,429 On the other hand, several observational
studies have supported the utility of aspirin in rescuing cognitive
dysfunctions.430–435 For instance, regular administration of low-
dose aspirin improved the cognitive function of the 123 SLE
patients recruited from a 3-year prospective study, with a
particular beneﬁcial impact observed among the elder individuals
also possessing cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes.430
However, no consensus has been reached regarding the use of
statin436 for treating cognitive dysfunctions according to current
clinical settings as has been recommended for preventing
cardiovascular comorbidities.

In addition, individualized multipronged strategies speciﬁcally
designed for mental health management have been recom-
mended for preventing cognitive dysfunctions. These can be
categorized into non-pharmacological and pharmacological
approaches.

improving neurovascular coupling that

Non-pharmacological interventions include the engagement of
regular physical activities and cognitive rehabilitation.422 Regular
physical activities encompass three lifestyle components,
i.e.,
mental, physical, social,437–439 which regain the cognitive func-
tionalities via, e.g.,
deﬁned as increased neuronal activities linked to the local
regulation of cerebral blood ﬂow.440 The beneﬁts of physical
activities to cognitive behavior improvement is dose-dependent.
That is, the risk of developing cognitive deterioration can be
ameliorated by taking moderate-intensity aerobic exercises for
30 min and 5 days per week or, alternatively, by taking high-
intensity aerobic exercises for above 20 min and 3 days per
week.441 Cognitive rehabilitation is performed by occupational
therapists to intensively retrain the cognitive and memory skills of
the patients,442,443 the process of which is comprised of, but not
limited to, cognitive behavior intervention, cognitive training
exercises, prioritization, time optimization and memory aids.444
Cognitive behavior intervention aims at helping SLE patients with
self-perceived cognitive dysfunctions to improve their memories
and the abilities to perform daily activities.445 Cognitive training
exercises such as chess can help the patients enhance their
executive functions and problem-resolving skills.444 Prioritization
can help SLE patients carrying cognitive dysfunctions to focus on
one task prior to proceeding to the next. Time optimization helps
the patients to prioritize cognitively intensive tasks to the earlier
time of a day. Memory aids aim to help the patients to better
manage their daily activities that can be in the form of, e.g.,
written reminders.422

Pharmacological medications used for

improving cognitive
dysfunctions include, primarily, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor
(NMDAR) antagonists, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and C5a
receptor blocking agents.

The NMDAR is an ionotropic glutamate receptor mediating
excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain, which are
localized in the postsynaptic terminal allowing for the inﬂux of
sodium (Na+) and Ca2+. NMDAR plays essential roles during
synaptic transmission for synaptic plasticity and normal neuronal
activities. Thus, NMDAR antagonists such as memantine can help
the patients regain memory and learning abilities, and thus have
been considered for managing patients carrying moderate-to-
severe dementia.446

Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme residing largely in the
synaptic cleft that rapidly breaks down acetylcholine molecules
to prevent prolonged action and allow for their in time recycling.
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, rivastigmine,
galantamine thus can help improve the cognitive abilities of the
patients by increasing the availability of acetylcholines at the
synaptic clefts and avoiding their overt activities.447 According to a
meta-analysis involving 10 randomized, double-blind, placebo-

controlled clinical trials of a 6-month treatment of acetylcholines-
terase inhibitors, these agents were found to be associated with
reduced cognition decline.448,449

The BBB is an unique structure in the brain for the maintenance
of brain homeostasis. The complement activation byproduct C5a
can elevate the permeability of BBB by relaying signals through its
G-protein coupled receptor C5aR1. Thus, C5a receptor blockage
therapeutics can prevent SLE patients from developing cognitive
syndromes by keeping the integrity of BBB.450 It has been shown
using MRL/lpr lupus prone mice that C5a receptor blockade can
effectively ameliorate BBB disruption for attenuated cognitive
abnormalities.451

CURRENT THERAPEUTICS FOR SLE TREATMENT
Current therapeutics attenuating immune response
TLR signaling plays a central role in the development of SLE.
Endosomal TLRs (including TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, and TLR13) that
are specialized to sense nucleic acids detect self-derived damage-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) together with surface TLRs
to collectively trigger
the downstream production of pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines. Therefore, disturbing TLR signaling
remains a strategy to ﬁght against SLE. Enpatoran, being a highly
selective dual TLR7 and TLR8 inhibitor, has been developed for
treating autoimmune disorders including SLE, CLE and myositis.
Several clinical trials including the ethno-bridging phase I trial
(NCT04880213) and the ongoing phase II trials (NCT05162586,
NCT05540327) have been or being performed to examine the
treatment efﬁcacy of enpatoran, as well as its pharmacokinetic,
pharmacodynamic, and clinical safety.452 Current clinical and pre-
clinical evidence have implicated a potential glucocorticoid-
sparing effect of enpatoran for SLE treatment and the promoted
overall health among SLE patients receiving enpatoran.452,453
E6742, another selective dual TLR7 and TLR8 inhibitor was found
capable of ameliorating the pathogenesis features of
lupus
mice,454 yet its clinical evidence from a phase I/II clinical trial
(NCT05278663), though been completed, has not been published.
On the other hand, anti-malarial agents such as hydroxychlor-
oquine, chloroquine, quinacrine and artemisinin can impede TLR
from recognizing nucleic acids via masking TLR-binding epitopes
of nucleic acids and thus be feasible for SLE treatment as
well.455–462 While hydroxychloroquine has been recommended for
all SLE patients due to its comparatively lower incidence of
developing side effects such as retinopathy and cardiomyopathy
than other antimalarial agents via inhibiting TLR3/7/9,348,463
chloroquine resolved skin lesions among CLE patients by
functioning as a TLR7/8/9 antagonist,459 quinacrine ameliorated
skin conditions of CLE patients through targeting TLR7/9,462 and
artemisinin prevented the recurrence of LN via inhibiting TLR4
(Table 2).460

Strategies targeting type I

IFNs for attenuated autoimmune
response and SLE severity have been established for SLE
treatment. For instance, litiﬁlimab, an antibody against blood DC
antigen 2 (BDCA2, also named CD303), which is expressed
exclusively on plasmacytoid DCs464 and a major predictor of type
I IFNs production,465 decreased the expression of genes relaying
IFN signals among SLE patients in a phase I clinical study
(NCT02106897)466 and attenuated the activities of SLE and CLE in
a phase II clinical trial (NCT02847598).467,468 Anifrolumab, a human
monoclonal antibody against type I
IFNs receptor subunit 1
exhibited improved complete renal response among LN patients
and reduced glucocorticoid use in a phase II randomized trial
(NCT02547922),469 elevated the response rate from a phase III trial
(NCT02446899),103 and long-term safety and tolerability in a
randomized
trial
(NCT02794285).470 Combining the standard therapy with anifro-
lumab showed higher remission rates than using the standard
therapy alone in SLE management according to a 4-year study.471

Attributing to these clinical successes, anifrolumab received its
ﬁrst approval as an add-on therapy for treating moderate-to-
severe SLE in the United States in July 2021,472 in Japan in
September 2021, in the Europe in February 2022, in Hong Kong in
December 2022, and in the Guangdong province of China in
October 2024.473,474 Medications directly targeting IFNα have also
demonstrated positive results on SLE management. For instance,
IFNα kinoid, a vaccine inducing neutralizing antibodies against
IFNα, signiﬁcantly reduced the IFN gene signature and attenuated
symptoms with an acceptable safety proﬁle in a phase IIb study
(NCT02665364)108 and phase I/II trial (NCT01058343) among SLE
patients.475 Anti-IFNα antibodies

Strategies targeting the JAK/STAT axis have also been shown
feasible for treating SLE via intervening type I
IFN mediated
signaling. These include, e.g., JAK inhibitors such as upadacitinib
and ﬁlgotinib, as well as STAT inhibitors such as ﬂudarabine and
artesunate. Speciﬁcally, upadacitinib reduced the ﬂares of SLE
patients with good tolerance in a phase II clinical
trial
(NCT03978520);110 and ﬁlgotinib showed desirable therapeutic
efﬁcacy in treating lupus membranous nephropathy according to

a phase II clinical trial (NCT03285711)478 and in treating moderate-
to-severe CLE based on results from another phase II study
(NCT03134222).479 Combined use of low-dose ﬂudarabine and
cyclophosphamide for a short duration led to long-lasting disease
remission among LN patients but bone marrow toxicity from a
phase I/II study;480,481 and artesunate demonstrated its therapeu-
tic efﬁcacy and safety in treating active lupus nephritis in a phase
IV trial (NCT03214731) when being coupled with the standard of
care482 (Table 2).

Strategies impairing the presentation of antigens to T cells by
innate lymphocyte cells (ILCs) have also been established for SLE
treatment. For example,
linear peptide
rigerimod (a 21-mer
inhibits B cell
derived from the small nuclear U1RNP-70K)
maturation by reducing the stability of MHC II molecules towards
blocked antigen presentation to auto-reactive T cells.483,484
Rigerimod improved the clinical symptoms of 20 moderate SLE
patients,485 and slightly outweighed placebo in a phase III trial
examining its clinical efﬁcacy in treating SLE (NCT02504645).486

Immunosuppressors such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathiopr-
ine, cyclophosphamide, mizoribine, and leﬂunomide have been
used for SLE treatment, attributing to their roles in imposing
cytotoxic effects on rapidly growing cells including proliferating T
and B lymphocytes.487–490 Speciﬁcally, mycophenolate mofetil
obstructs the formation of guanine nucleotides via inhibiting
inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and thus
disturbs the generation of DNA necessary for cell replication;489
azathioprine is a purine antagonist blocking nucleotide synthesis
and inhibiting leukocyte proliferation;488 and cyclophosphamide
functions as an alkylating agent disrupting DNA replication.487
Mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide have
all been widely used in the clinics for SLE management with
considerable good therapeutic responses received. Yet, cyclopho-
sphamide is more inclined to be used as an induction therapy
(often applied as the ﬁrst-phase therapeutics) for treating severe
conditions, azathioprine is prone to maintain the disease
situations, and mycophenolate mofetil serves both therapeutic
purposes481,491–501 with comparable efﬁcacy and reduced toxi-
city.500 Mizoribine,
functioning similarly with mycophenolate
mofetil, enhanced the clinical and serological
indexes of 5 SLE
patients.502 Leﬂunomide works as a dihydroorotate dehydrogen-
ase (DHOH) inhibitor to interfere with pyrimidine synthesis.503 It
has been shown that low-dose leﬂunomide effectively improved
the treatment efﬁcacy and safety of Chinese LE patients receiving
prednisone therapeutics,494 and a trial involving 17 LE patients
demonstrated the safety and efﬁcacy of leﬂunomide in treating
refractory LE patients or those having developed resistance to
conventional therapies.504 Leﬂunomide displayed a similar efﬁcacy
with azathioprine in treating LN (NCT01172002).492 In addition,
calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine A, tacrolimus and
voclosporin have been used for SLE management via executing
their immunosuppressive functions.505,506 For instance, cyclospor-
ine A improved the therapeutic outcome of LN receiving
prednisolone (a type of corticosteroids);493 and was shown as
effective as cyclophosphamide in treating LN patients according
to a phase II trial (NCT00976300).496 Tacrolimus suppressed T cell
activation and B cell differentiation by inhibiting the calcineurin
pathway as a result of inhibited dephosphorylation and transloca-
tion of NFAT.507,508 A prospective clinical case study involving 19
patients demonstrated the feasibility and safety of long-term and
low-dose use of tacrolimus for treating young LN patients;509 and
a phase IV clinical trial composed of 150 LN patients and an
unknown phase study reported comparable treatment efﬁcacies
between tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in the long run
(NCT00371319).510,511 Voclosporin, another calcineurin inhibi-
tor,512,513 showed superior safety, efﬁcacy and feasibility for its
long-term use in phase III clinical trials against LN (NCT03021499,

induction therapy for treating active LN for enhanced renal
response rate (NCT02141672) (Table 2).516

The pair of CD40 receptor and its ligand CD40L (i.e., CD40-
CD40L) is one of the most critical molecular axes mediating the
crosstalk between T and B cells.517 While B cells constitutively
express high levels of CD40, T cells express high levels of CD40L
upon activation.517 Due to the essential role of the CD40-CD40L
interaction played during the adaptive immune response, agents
targeting CD40 or CD40L have been established that had held a
great promise. For instance, dapirolizumab pegol has demon-
strated its efﬁcacy and safety in treating SLE via targeting CD40L
according to a phase II trial (NCT02804763),518,519 and is currently
undergoing two phase III trials as a therapeutic against SLE
(NCT04976322, NCT04294667) (Table 2).

studies

BLyS and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) are vital
survival
factors regulating B cell survival, proliferation and
differentiation.520 Thus, BLyS inhibitors may execute immunosup-
pression capacity via dampening the activation and proliferation
of B cells.521 Belimumab, an inhibitor of BLyS having been
approved by FDA for SLE management in 2011, has been effective
in dealing with and preventing renal damages among SLE
patients.522–524 Blisibimod, another BLyS inhibitor, has been
associated with reduced steroids, decreased proteinuria among
SLE patients in a phase III study (NCT01395745);525 blisibimod also
signiﬁcantly reduced levels of proteinuria, anti-dsDNA antibody, B
cells but increased the amount of complements C3 and C4 in a
phase II study (NCT01162681).526 Tabalumab, through suppressing
BLyS, displayed positive therapeutic changes regarding the levels
of anti-dsDNA antibody, complements, B cells and immunoglo-
bulins according to two phase III
(NCT01196091,
NCT01205438).527,528 Several clinical trials are being conducted
to investigate the efﬁcacy of ianalumab in treating SLE as an
inhibitor of the BLyS receptor.529 Atacicept, a recombinant fusion
protein concomitantly blocking BLyS and APRIL, showed ther-
apeutic ﬁtness in treating SLE patients especially for those with
high disease activity in a phase II study (NCT01972568).530
Atacicept was also associated with reduced levels of total
IgG
and anti-dsDNA antibody as well as increased amount of C3 and
C4 in a phase II/III study (NCT00624338).531,532 Telitacicept is a
fusion protein comprised of a recombinant
transmembrane
activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor
(TACI) receptor fused to the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of
human IgG. By binding to and neutralizing the activity of BLyS and
APRIL, telitacicept suppresses the development and survival of PCs
and mature B cells. Telitacicept received its ﬁrst approval in China
for treating active SLE patients in 2021.533 Rozibafusp alfa (AMG
is a ﬁrst-in-class bispeciﬁc IgG2-peptide fusion protein
570)
designed to target both BLyS and inducible T-cell costimulator
ligand (ICOSL), where ICOSL is mainly expressed on B cells and
the
APCs. By suppressing BLyS,
differentiation and survival of B cells and PCs.
In addition,
rozibafusp alfa blocks the interactions between Th cells (especially
Tfh) and B cells for impaired antibody production as a result of
inhibited ICOSL. The therapeutic efﬁcacy of rozibafusp alfa was
promising according to the results obtained from mouse SLE
models.534 Phase I and II clinical trials examining the feasibility of
using rozibafusp alfa for SLE treatment have been launched with
the results not available yet (NCT02618967, NCT04058028).535
(Table 2).

rozibafusp alfa dampens

Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), an intracellular signaling molecule
of B and myeloid cell pathways, is of the vital importance for B cell
development and activities. Activated BTK signaling is associated
with elevated production of auto-antibodies that can form ICs with
auto-antigens and deposit in tissues to induce inﬂammation and
damage the lesions.536,537 BTK inhibitors such as elsubrutinib,
branebrutinib,
represent a
portfolio of promising immunosuppressors coping with SLE.

improved SLE clinical syndromes without obvious adverse concerns
in a phase II study (NCT03978520).110 Branebrutinib, another BTK
inhibitor with demonstrated in vivo evidence showing its super-
iority in treating SLE,538 is currently under clinical
investigation
(NCT04186871).539 The BTK inhibitor fenebrutinib reduced the
levels of anti-dsDNA antibody and total IgG, and increased that of
complement C4 among SLE patients according to a phase II study
(NCT02908100).540 Evobrutinib displayed a positive long-term
efﬁcacy in treating SLE patients carrying relapsed multiple sclerosis
in a phase II trial (NCT02975336).541 More BTK inhibitors are under
investigations regarding their ﬁtness in treating that,
clinical
include, e.g., orelabrutinib (NCT04305197, NCT05688696),542,543
zanubrutinib (NCT04643470),544 and AC0058TA (NCT03878303)
(Table 2).545

Besides inhibiting B cell activation, B cell depletion represents
another portfolio of strategies attenuating over-activated adaptive
immune response for SLE control. CD19 and CD20 are B cell
linkage-speciﬁc antigens expressed on the surface of most B cell
lymphocytes, with CD19 being expressed across the entire
spectrum during B cell maturation and CD20 being present during
lymphogenesis.546,547 Obexelimab is a
the late stages of B cell
monoclonal antibody binding to CD19 and FcyRIIb, and has been
reported by a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase
II study capable of reducing the amount of B cells in SLE patients for
improved therapeutic response and efﬁcacy (NCT02725515).548
Therapeutics utilizing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells to
target CD19 and/or B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) expressed on
B cells or their end-stage PCs have proven to be a revolutionary
successful regimen for treating diseases associated with over-
activated B cells including SLE.549 Mechanically, hyperactive B cells
can cause inﬂammation and tissue damage by producing overt
autoantibodies, and carefully designed CAR-T therapeutics can reset
the immune system to alleviate the disease symptoms.550,551 For
example, CAR-T cells targeting CD19 hold a signiﬁcant promise in
treating refractory SLE patients, with rapid and profound depletion
of B cells and concomitant improvement in clinical symptoms and
serological markers being reported.551–555 A phase I study employ-
ing a dual targeting strategy against CD19 and BCMA depleted
both B cells and PCs, with the majority of the SLE patients showing
negative results for all autoantibodies including those secreted by
long-lived PCs after the treatment.555 More clinical trials on CAR-T
cells targeting other B cell speciﬁc antigens or antigen combina-
tions such as BCMA CAR-T cells (NCT06038474),556 CD20/BCMA
(NCT06249438),557 and CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells
CAR-T cells
(NCT06462144, NCT06153095, NCT06567080) in treating SLE have
been registered.558–560 Despite these encouraging clinical results
regarding the safety and efﬁcacy of CAR-T cell therapeutics in
that have substantially
treating SLE patients, challenges exist
hindered the wide adoption of this promising approach for SLE
management. First, the long-term persistence and functionality of
CAR-based immune cells are not completely understood, and there
is a need for ongoing monitoring to assess the durability of
therapeutic response and the potential of disease relapse.549
Second, the risk of developing cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome
(ICANS) remain a concern, although it has been considered to be
milder in the autoimmune setting as compared with that for
treating cancers.550 Third, most CAR-T therapeutic modalities for
treating SLE are autologous CD19-targeting CAR-T cells that are
limited by the cell source and thus costly.550 To resolve these issues,
several clinical trials investigating the feasibility of allogenic CD19-
targeting CAR-T cells (NCT05988216, NCT06340490, NCT05859997,
NCT06429800, NCT06294236, NCT06375993)561–566 and allogenic
CD19-targeting CAR-NK cells (NCT06421701, NCT06010472)567,568 in
treating SLE have been registered. A pre-clinical study successfully
engineered Treg cells to express CD19-speciﬁc CAR using a mice
lupus model through genetic editing, which yielded promising
results.569 Rituximab, belonging to the ﬁrst generation of CD20

antibodies, has been shown with clinical and histopathological
evidence in improving the symptoms of LN patients570 and some
SLE patients refractory to conventional therapies.495,571 In addition,
rituximab decreased the anti-dsDNA antibody levels and increased
the complement levels of SLE patients according to a phase III
clinical trial involving 144 SLE patients (NCT00282347) and a phase
(NCT00137969).572,573 Though

rituximab has not been approval for treating SLE in the clinics, it
has been recommended for refractory SLE management in 2023
EULAR recommendations.506 To further enhance the efﬁcacy of
rituximab in depleting B cells, two phase I trials (NCT06265220,
NCT06581562) have combined ribuximab with AB-101, an allogenic
NK cell product capable of killing target cells via antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), in 2024.574,575 Other
CD20 antibodies with clinical evidence for SLE treatment include,
e.g., ofatumumab that decreased the disease activity of 3 juvenile
SLE patients in a single center study,576 ocrelizumab that showed

study
(NCT00626197),577 and obinutuzumab that achieved increased
renal responses and decreased ﬂares among LN patients once
combined with the standard therapies in a phase II study
(NCT02550652).578,579 CD22,
though being considered as an
inhibitory receptor keeping the baseline level of B cell inhibition
and the humoral immunity in check, has been used as a therapeutic
target for depleting dysregulated B cells due to its restrictive
expression on the surface of B cells.580 It has been shown that
epratuzumab, a humanized anti-CD22 antibody, could effectively
treat moderate and severe SLE patients with acceptable safety in
several phase II and phase III studies (NCT00111306, NCT00383214,
NCT00383513, NCT00624351).102,581 But epratuzumab failed in two
phase III clinical trials (NCT01262365 NCT01261793).106 Abatacept, a
soluble fusion protein linking the extracellular domain of human
to the
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
modiﬁed Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1, can bind to
CD80/CD86 on the surface of APCs including B cells for impaired
adaptive immune response activation and,
in particular, B cell
depletion.582 Thus, Abatacept has been associated with reduced
production of anti-dsDNA antibody and proteinuria, and increased
levels of C3 and C4 levels among active class III or IV LN patients
(NCT00430677).583–586

trial

PCs are differentiated B lymphocyte capable of antibody
secretion.48,587 Instead of depleting B cells, one can also remove
PCs. CD38 is a pleiotropic molecule expressed on the surface of
PCs.48 Daratumumab, being an antibody targeting CD38, has led
to a dramatic desirable therapeutic response in two refractory life-
threatening SLE patients, with depleted PCs among other clinical
indexes being observed.588 Several other clinical studies investi-
gating the efﬁcacy and safety of daratumumab as a SLE
therapeutics have been currently registered and under investiga-
tions (NCT04868838, NCT04810754). Bortezomib, being a speciﬁc,
reversible inhibitor of the 20S subunit of the proteasome,589
signiﬁcantly reduced the amount of PCs in the peripheral blood
and bone marrow by approximately 50%,590–592 and demon-
strated its treatment efﬁcacy in dealing with refractory and severe
SLE (Table 2).589,593

Long-lived PCs are end-staged B cells residing in the bone
marrow and other tissues that can survive for decades.594 Long-
lived PCs may drive chronic immune responses due to its
sustaining production of autoantibodies,595 leading to persistent
SLE clinical syndrome or therapeutic resistance. It is worth noting
that while removing long-lived PCs without affecting their
precursors may not eradicate them, depleting B cells (the
precursors of PCs) may promote the development of long-lived
PCs, suggesting the need of a combinatorial therapeutic design.
For instance, the small-molecule proteasome inhibitor bortezomib

effectively depleted PCs and reduced autoantibodies but did not
affect their precursors;596 rituximab, the chimeric antibody against
the CD20 antigen, depleted B cells but stimulated the survival of
long-lived PCs and thus led to rituximab resistance.597 Thus,
combinatorial strategies targeting both long-lived PCs and their
precursors such as the ‘bortezomib+rituximab’ regimen have
been considered promising in SLE treatment.598

Similar to the rational of depleting B cells or PCs, depleting
speciﬁc subsets of autoreactive T cells associated with SLE may
also contribute to SLE attenuation. For instance, immunization of 6
SLE patients with inactivated autoreactive T cells decreased the
disease activities without signiﬁcant side effects being observed
by inducing idiotype anti-idiotypic reactions.599

Increasing the immune tolerance of B cells may be another
attractive strategy against SLE. Abetimus sodium is an immuno-
modulating agent capable of inducing the immune tolerance of B
cells by directly binding to and cross-linking pathogenic
autoantibodies such as anti-dsDNA antibody that are pathoge-
netic factors of LN (a chronic kidney disease developed
accompanied with SLE patients).600 A phase III clinical trial has
indicated that administrating abetimus sodium can effectively
reduce

giopathy among LN and SLE patients,603,604 with several successful
cases being reported.605,606 Ravulizumab, another C5 antibody,
has been registered to investigate its clinical efﬁcacy in treating LN
and IgA nephropathy (NCT04564339).607 Avacopan, a C5a receptor
inhibitor, is currently being planned to be investigated for treating
SLE.608 Pegcetacoplan, a C3 inhibitor, has been shown effective in
treating complement-mediated nephropathy including LN in a
phase II study (NCT03453619)609 (Table 2).

instance, antibodies targeting
receptors in response to Th2-generated cytokines represent an
important portfolio of cytokine milieu modulating strategies for
SLE treatment. For instance, IL6 promoted the maturation of B
cells and differentiation of CD4+ T cells into Th17 but not Treg
cells;610,611 and antibodies targeting the IL6 receptor such as
tocilizumab, PF-04236921 and sirukumab showed desirable
treatment efﬁcacies in managing SLE. Speciﬁcally, the feasibility
of using tocilizumab in treating SLE has been documented by a
case report612 and a phase II study (NCT00046774);613 that of PF-
04236921 has been reported by a post-hoc study of a phase II trial

Th1 and Treg cells counterbalances the skewed immune micro-
enviroment of SLE patients, it may revert the cytokine proﬁle to
the other end, rendering dual targeting of opposite cytokine axes
towards microenvironment homeostasis an emerging trend for
SLE therapeutics. For example, ustekinumab,614,615 a monoclonal

(NCT02349061).616,617 As another example, inhibitors of phospho-
diesterase 4 (PDE4) such as apremilast have been shown effective
in treating autoimmune diseases including refractory skin lesions
of lupus in a trial involving 5 participants618 and in a phase II study
involving 8 CLE patients (NCT00708916)619 by suppressing Th1
and Th17-mediated immune responses620 (Table 2).

Restoring Th17/Treg homeostasis via directly injecting cell
materials has been proposed as a promising strategy for treating
SLE. For instance, Tregs injected into lupus mice has attenuated
the inﬂammatory response and alleviated the pathological
syndromes of SLE.621 Stem cell therapies have shown a long-
term efﬁcacy and safety for SLE management622–624 by increasing
the proportion of Treg cells among SLE patients.625 Low-dose IL2
has been associated with a rapid remission of SLE or CLE with

IL10 antibody (that can be
naturally produced by Treg cells) has been documented to be
feasible in treating refractory SLE patients according to a clinical
study involving 6 participants.632 From another point of view,
secukinumab, an IL17A antibody functioning via blocking the
interactions between IL17A and its receptor, has been successfully
used to treat multiple autoimmune disorders such as ankylosing
spondylitis, psoriasis, leprosy and,633,634 importantly, refractory LN
patients.635–637 Pre-clinical studies have also shown that exosomes
from umbilical cord blood MSCs can restore the Th17/Treg
balance by lowering the percentage of Th17 subsets (Table 2).638
Some hormonal therapies have been shown effective in treating
SLE via modulating the immuno-regulatory milieu. Glucocorticoids
such as betamethasone,639 dexamethasone,640 hydrocortisone,641
prednisone,642 prednisolone,643 triamcinolone,644,645 methylpred-
nisolone,393,646,647 which have long been applied topically or
the
systematically for SLE treatment, are prone to inhibit
differentiation of Th17 cells and enhance that of Treg cells.
particular, glucocorticoids can decrease the number of Th17 cells
and lower the level of IL17A for attenuated SLE symptom,648 and
requires the aid of functioned Treg cells to exert anti-inﬂammation
roles649 as evidenced by the upregulated Treg cells on gluco-
corticoid intake.650 Interestingly,
increased levels of systemic
glucocorticoid may protect the organism from running into Th1
over-dominance by modulating the Th1/Th2 balance, where the
expression of Th1promoting cytokines such as IL12 and CSF were
down-regulated and the secretion of Th2type cytokines such as
IL4, IL10 and IL13 were up-regulated.651,652 Also, methylpredniso-
lone pulse therapy has demonstrated its feasibility in treating SLE
via promoting Treg cell differentiation (Table 2).647

Metabolic abnormalities remain as the underlying mechanism

pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid synthesis, and glutamino-
lysis are predominant in Th17 cells,
fatty acid oxidation and
oxidative phosphorylation are active in Treg cells. Thus, repro-
graming T cell metabolic patterns has emerged as an effective
strategy for managing SLE patients through reversing the Treg/
Th17 imbalance and restoring the immune homeostasis.653
Following this rational, rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, has been
proposed for SLE treatment that functions by reprogramming T
cell metabolic patterns towards prevented over-activation of Th17
cells and improved Treg proliferation, and been proven to
alleviate disease severity among SLE patients in a phase I/II trial
(NCT00779194).654,655 Statins, a class of drugs

Th17/Treg imbalance and alleviating Th17-mediated inﬂammatory

Current therapeutics rescuing impaired debris clearance
machinery
SLE patients are characterized by high autoantibody loads that
form ICs, inefﬁcient clearance of which accelerate SLE syndroms.
Most autoantibodies found in SLE carriers are IgG that can be
recognized by FcγRIIIB, a type of Fcγ receptors capable of
recognizing the Fc portion of IgG and expressed on neutrophils
and a subset of basophils. FcγRIIIB participates in IC clearance by
promoting phagocytosis, adhesion, and the respiratory burst in
neutrophils.662 FcγRIIB is another member of the FcγR family that
are primarily expressed on B cells, macrophages, and DCs.663 As
dysfunctional FcγRIIB and FcγRIIIB have both been implicated in
priming SLE,662 therapeutics mimicking the effect of
these
receptors have been established for SLE management. For
instance, valziﬂocept, a recombinant soluble human FcγRIIb that
binds to ICs as a decoy, has been shown promising in a double-
blind placebo-controlled multicenter study for managing SLE
symptoms.663,664

Puriﬁed or recombinant complement proteins may not be
recommended for treating SLE in the clinics due to the possible
damaging effects of overtly stimulated complement system.
Speciﬁcally, hyperactivated complement system via the alternative
pathway may damage cells such as podocytes and tissues such as
the blood vessel endothelium that deteriorate the SLE symptoms.
Thus, the fresh frozen plasma containing multiple complement
proteins has been launched in the clinics, with therapeutic
successes being documented in treating C1q-deﬁcient SLE
patients665 and those harboring C2 deﬁciency.666 Plasma
exchange may represent another strategy to fuel sufﬁcient
complements in the blood to remove pathological antibodies
and their complexes with the immune components in time for
alleviated SLE symptoms (Table 2).667–669

CONCLUSIONS
We reviewed the history of the SLE research ﬁeld and the
epidemiology of this disease, grouped the mechanisms-of-action
driving SLE pathogenesis into three categories, i.e., activating the
immune response, skewing the cytokine microenvironment, and
impairing the debris clearance machinery; summarized current
knowledge on SLE diagnosis by the disease onset, activity and
comorbidities;
the
genetic, epigenetic, hormonal, extrinsic levels; and, importantly,
classiﬁed current SLE preventive and treatment strategies follow-
ing the logic of the identiﬁed mechanisms. It is worth noting that
these groups used for classifying current SLE preventive and
therapeutic strategies are not mutually exclusive, as most SLE
management approaches take action through multiple mechan-
isms. For instance, glucocorticoid, primarily functions via modulat-
ing the cytokine microenvironment,648–652 also attenuates the
immune response by inhibiting the maturation and activity of DCs,
interfering with TCR signaling, and inducing B cell apoptosis as
well as affecting the downstream pathways of B cell receptor
signaling such as NF-κB.349 As another example, the methylpred-
nisolone pulse therapy functions not only by promoting Treg cell

differentiation, but also via inducing the apoptosis of CD4+
T cells.647 Similarly, hydroxychloroquine, known capable of
alleviating SLE and largely by blocking TLR signaling,455 also
modulates the cytokine distribution and homeostasis among Th1,
Th2, Th17 and Treg cells.670,671

Given our incremental understanding on the priming role of
intrinsic features in predisposing SLE and the increasing need for
precision medicine, focusing on personalized SLE treatment taking
advantages of genetic or immunological markers may represent a
promising therapeutic perspective. Thus, identifying representa-
the three identiﬁed
tive markers associated with each of
pathogenesis stages and establishing rapid yet cost-effective
screening techniques may aid in the therapeutic design and lead
one future direction.
