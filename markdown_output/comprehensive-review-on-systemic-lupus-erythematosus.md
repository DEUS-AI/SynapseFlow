Technically  referred  to  as  Systemic  Lupus  Erythematosus  (SLE),
lupus is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system
of  the  body  unintentionally  targets  healthy  tissue  in  various
sections of the body. The severity of a person's symptoms might
range from minor to severe. Joint pain and swelling, fever, chest
pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, enlarged lymph nodes, fatigue, and
a red rash, which is most frequently on the face, are all common
symptoms. There are frequently symptom-free periods known as
remissions  between  flare-ups  of  the  condition.  There  is  no
known  cause  of  SLE.  Genetics  and  environmental  factors  are
thought to play a role. There is a 24% probability that the other
identical twin will also be impacted if one is additionally thought
to  raise  the  risk  are  female  sex  hormones,  sunshine,  smoking,
vitamin  D  deficiency,  and  specific  diseases.  Autoantibodies'
immunological  reaction  against  a  person's  own  tissues  is  the
process.  Inflammation  is  brought  on  by  these  antibodies,  which
are typically anti-nuclear. A diagnosis is made based on a mix of
symptoms  and
investigations,  which  can  be
challenging.  Numerous  more  lupus  erythematosus  types  exist,
such  as  discoid  lupus,  neonatal  lupus,  and  subacute  cutaneous
lupus erythematosus. Although there is no known treatment for
SLE,  there  are  some  in  development.  NSAIDs,  corticosteroids,
immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate are
a few possible treatments. Although corticosteroids work quickly,
prolonged use has negative side effects. There is no evidence that
complementary  medicine  can  treat  the  condition.  People  with
SLE  have  shorter  life  expectancies.  Cardiovascular  disease,  the
leading  cause  of  death,  is  substantially  more  likely  as  a  result  of
SLE. With current medicine, 80% of patients with the condition
live for more than 15 years. Pregnancies in lupus-affected women
are  more  risky  but  typically  successful.  SLE  rates  might  range
from  20  to  70  per  100,000  people  depending  on  the  country.
Men are afflicted roughly nine times less frequently than women
of  childbearing  age.  Although  it  often  starts  between  the  ages.
Although it typically starts between the ages of 15 and 45, it can
affect  people  of  all  ages.  African,  Caribbean,  and  Chinese
individuals  are  more  vulnerable  than  white  people.  It  is
unknown how common diseases are in underdeveloped nations.
Lupus  is  Latin  for  "wolf":  the  disease  was  so-named  in  the  13th
century as the rash was thought to appear like a wolf's bite.

Today, more than 90% of people survive for over ten years, and
many of them do so largely symptom-free.80–90% can anticipate
having  a  typical  lifespan.  However,  mortality  rates  are  higher
than  they  are  for  those  without  SLE.  Men  and  children  often
have  worse  prognoses  than  women,  although  if  symptoms  start
after  age  60,  the  disease  tends  to  progress  more  subtly.  Organ
failure or severe infections are the two causes of early mortality,
which  occurs  within  5  years.  Both  of  these  conditions  can  be
changed by prompt diagnosis and treatment. The most common
cause of death for those with SLE is cardiovascular disease from
accelerated  atherosclerosis,  which  increases  the  mortality  risk
fivefold  when  compared  to  the  general  population  in  the  late
stages.  Excessive  blood  pressure  and  high  cholesterol  should  be
avoided  or  aggressively  managed
the  risk  of
cardiovascular  problems.  When  possible,
take  additional
medications  that  can  lessen  symptoms  in  addition  to  using
steroids at the lowest dosage for the shortest time possible.

Epidemiology

SLE  incidence  varies  by  nation,  race,  and  sex,  and  it  evolves
through  time.  SLE  is  estimated  to  impact  between  322,000  to
over 1 million people in the United States; with a rate of 53 per
100,000  people  (98  to  over  305  per  100,000).The  rate  are
roughly  40  per  100,000  inhabitants  in  Northern  Europe.  SLE
affects  people  of  non-European  heritage  more  frequently  and
more  severely.  Afro-Caribbean  people  have  been  observed  to
have a rate as high as 159 per 100,000.Girls are four times more
likely  than  boys  to  develop  childhood-onset  systemic  lupus
erythematosus,  which  typically  manifests  between  the  ages  of  3
and  15.  Socioeconomic  status  is  important,  although  gender
differences  in  SLE  can  also  be  seen  in  its  start  and  duration.
lower  socioeconomic
Women  with  SLE  who  are
backgrounds have been found to have higher depression scores,
higher BMIs, and less access to healthcare than women with the
illness from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. If a person with
SLE  came  from  a  lower  socioeconomic  background,  their  self-
reported anxiety and sadness scores were higher.
