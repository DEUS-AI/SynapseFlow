CONFERENCE REPORTS

Recent advances in

autoimmune diseases



Conference rapporteur: David Jones

This conference, held at the Royal College of Physicians on 11

May 1999, was organised by Professor Margaret Bassendine,

Professor of Hepatology, University of Newcastle.

Autoimmune diseases affect up to 5% of the Western
population1. Study of autoimmune disease in humans - an
'experiment of nature' where the normal mechanisms of
immune self-tolerance break down - has also provided
important information regarding the ways in which the
normal state of tolerance to self is maintained. Recent
advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis and
therapy of human autoimmunity were the topic of this
conference.

Pathophysiology of autoimmune disease

The immune system of mammals represents the culmina­
tion of millions of years of evolutionary pressure. Until
(very) recent times this pressure has arisen almost
exclusively from the effects of infectious disease on the
evolutionarily relevant young adult population. Effector
mechanisms able to clear invading parasites from the host
are the sine qua non of a functional immune system. Study
of human disease provides powerful examples, however, of
the damaging effects of continual or inappropriate
activation of these effector systems. Survival advantage is
therefore only likely to be conferred on the host if the appli­
cation of immune effector mechanisms is selective, and
appropriate to the context in which any immune stimulus is
encountered.

Selectivity and the immune response

Many cells of the evolutionarily more primitive innate
system, such as macrophages and neutrophils, undergo
activation in response to chemical or 'pattern recognition'
factors unique to infectious organisms, resulting in some
selectivity in their response. However, the diversity of these
selectivity factors for the innate immune response is
limited. Moreover, as infectious organisms are themselves
subject to evolutionary pressure (and 'reproduce' at a
dramatically higher rate than their hosts), pathways evolved
to escape these limited selectivity factors.

As a result of this evolutionary pressure, the more highly
developed immune system in mammals has evolved the
specific immune response - a second tier of selectivity with
an almost infinite capacity to develop responses to foreign
protein antigens through the mechanisms generating
diversity in the T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes.
This infinite capacity to respond to proteins can be an
extremely effective tool for the protection of the host:
regardless of the extent to which infectious organisms can
change their protein identity, the immune system is likely
to have a responding cell with randomly generated
response specificity. However, through generation of
responses wholly reactive with self-antigens, it can also
cause damage to the host.

The specific immune system has therefore evolved a
series of 'checks and balances' to discriminate harmless self
(self-antigen seen in a non-inflammatory environment)
from harmful non-self (foreign antigen encountered in the
context of an inflammatory environment) whilst permitting
the existence of harmless non-self (for example a dietary
antigen encountered in the absence of inflammation)2.
Autoimmune disease results when this discriminant
function fails.

Genetic factors and environmental triggers

The conventional and widely held view is that auto­
immunity occurs when a genetically susceptible individual
encounters a 'trigger' capable of disturbing the normal state
of immune self-tolerance. The evidence in favour of this
model comes largely from studies of disease patterns within
families. Autoimmune diseases have been widely reported
to be concentrated within families, suggesting a role for
genetic factors in determining disease susceptibility. Data
from interval mapping (whole genome scanning), and case
control gene association studies, have primarily implicated
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in suscepti­
bility to autoimmunity. Interest has also recently focused on
other loci (for example the T-cell surface marker CTLA-4)
which show strong disease associations and which encode
proteins playing additional fundamental roles in the control
of induction and termination of T-cell responses. A further
locus identified as a susceptibility marker in type I diabetes
is a promoter polymorphism in the insulin gene. It has been
proposed that the protective allele at this locus increases
low level expression of insulin in the thymus allowing
continual deletion of potential insulin-derived epitope­
specific T-cell-precursors during thymic ontogeny.

Data derived from autoimmune disease families, in
particular the lack of complete penetrance of diseases such
as type I diabetes in monozygotic twins, have also empha­
sised the role played by additional factors in disease
induction, which are presumed to be environmental in
nature. The ability of infectious organisms to shape the
normal immune system has led to the suggestion that these
environmental triggers for autoimmunity are infectious
agents. However, the data directly implicating specific
infectious agents in individual diseases are limited, and the
whole concept of simple infectious triggers for autoimmunity
in genetically 'primed' hosts has recently been challenged.
Emerging data from human populations suggest that
multiple infections in the first few years of life may protect
against the subsequent development of one autoimmune
disease (type I diabetes). Equally challenging is the observa­
tion that the prevalence of diseases such as type I diabetes
has increased markedly over the last 30 years, a time when
improvements in hygiene and control of childhood infections
through programmes of vaccination may have significantly
reduced the burden of infection in the early years of life.

Viruses

In Sjogren's syndrome, attention has focused on the Herpes
viruses and retroviruses, with emphasis on sialotrophic and
lymphotrophic agents with the capacity for latent or persis­
tent infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which encodes a
large number of immunomodulatory proteins and which is
B-lymphotropic and epitheliotropic, is one such candidate
trigger. Four case reports have linked EBV infection with the
subsequent development of Sjogren's syndrome, whilst anti­

bodies to a number of EBV proteins have also been reported
(variably) in Sjogren's syndrome.

Retroviruses are present in two forms in humans: the
infectious retroviruses and the endogenous retroviruses
(which result from the incorporation of a proviral genome
into the human genome and which are inherited in a
Mendelian fashion). The caprine arthritis encephalitis virus
(a ubiquitous retrovirus in goats affecting up to 90% of
animals in some herds) can induce an MHC linked
polyarthritis in a minority of infected animals. In humans, a
range of rheumatic syndromes has been described in HIV
infection. Low levels of antibody against retroviral Gag
proteins have been described in both Sjogren's syndrome
and lupus. Attempts have been made to isolate putative
infectious retroviruses by co-culturing affected labial
biopsies with susceptible cell lines and screening for viral
derived proteins and nucleic acids. These approaches have
shown promise for the isolation of retroviruses inducing
autoimmunity in humans.

The complement system in autoimmunity

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterised by
specific autoantibody responses to intracellular antigens (in
particular nuclear and related antigens including
chromatin, the spliceosome and the Ro & La small cyto­
plasmic ribonucleoprotein particles [scRNP]). Other auto­
antibodies include those directed at phospholipids normally
found on the inside of the cell membrane. The link between
these antibodies and the mechanism of tissue damage has
remained an area of much speculation, although immuno­
histochemical studies of affected tissues (such as the
glomeruli) suggest deposition of both antibodies and
immune complexes together with complement derived
proteins. Studies of the rare patients with inherited
complement abnormalities (such as the 41 reported patients
with homozygous Clq deficiency, the majority of whom
developed SLE or discoid lupus early in life) suggest that
there is a hierarchy of susceptibility to lupus related to the
position in the complement cascade of the component
encoded by the mutant gene, with Clq deficiency at the
top. These observations suggest a role for the early factors
in the classical complement cascade in protection against
SLE. One such potential role is to clear immune complexes.
To address the question of the role played by activation of
the classical complement pathway in SLE, a targeted
mutation mouse model of Clq deficiency has been
developed. Between six and eight months of age 25% of the
Clq -/- 'knockout' mice die of glomerulonephritis, with
histological and immuno-histochemical features similar to
those seen in SLE patients.

Data increasingly suggest a role for apoptotic cells
(expressing SLE related autoantigens aberrantly on their
surface) in the generation of autoantibodies driving
immune complex formation in SLE. As Clq can bind to
apoptotic keratinocytes, this suggests a possible role for the
classical component cascade in the clearance of apoptotic

cells, and a possible mechanism whereby Clq deficient
animals could be susceptible to immune-complex driven
glomerulonephritis. Strikingly, Clq deficient animals
demonstrate increased frequency of apoptotic cells in their
glomeruli, and decreased clearance of apoptotic cells in an
in vitro model - findings which appear to support this
model.

IgG constant region show a clinical response. Combination
of anti-TNF-a antibody with conventional treatments such
as methotrexate has a useful anti-TNF-a dose sparing effect.
Other approaches to cytokine based therapy in RA have
included blocking IE-1, IL-6 and IL-10 although, to date,
these remain purely experimental.

Cytokines

Thyroid disease has served as a model for the role played by
cytokines in autoimmunity. The mutually regulating Thl
and Th2 phenotype T-cell responses are characterised by
cytokine patterns that produce contrasting effector
mechanisms (Thl phenotype cells secrete interferon
[IFN]-y and support cellular responses [for example in
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis], Th2 phenotype cells secret inter­
leukin [IL]-4 and IL-5 and support mature humoral
responses [for example in Graves' disease]). Although of
value, this paradigm represents an over-simplification of the
complex inter-relationships of different functional cell sets3.

Cytokines also exert direct effects in autoimmunity.
Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy results from cytokine
induced swelling of the extra-ocular muscles by an inflam­
matory infiltrate consisting primarily of activated T-cells.
The muscle fibres are intact but show increased spacing as
a result of glycosaminoglycan production by fibroblasts in
the muscle. These fibroblasts are stimulated by local
cytokines secreted by autoreactive T-cells. The response of
the orbital fibroblasts is a particular characteristic of cells
from this site, and is marked in comparison with equivalent
cells from other tissues such as the dermis. This apparent
difference in function may go some way to explain the
tissue tropism of fibroblast mediated pathology seen in
thyroid associated ophthalmopathy. Interrupting this path­
way may represent a potential approach to treatment of this
clinically important manifestation of autoimmune thyroid
disease.

Therapy of autoimmune disease

Rheumatoid arthritis

As disruption of regulatory cytokine networks undoubtedly
contributes to the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease,
therapy aimed at restoring the normal regulatory balance is
an attractive concept.

Anti-cytokine therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) aims
to block tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a function using
either humanised murine monoclonal antibodies to TNF-a
or soluble TNF-a receptor molecules. A single dose of the
agent CA2 (infliximab) suppresses synovitis and serum
inflammation markers for up to 6 weeks (in up to 80% of
treated patients using optimal doses), whilst multiple treat­
ment regimes showed effects on severity of joint involve­
ment. Similarly, up to 80% of patients treated with chimeric
molecules consisting of recombinant TNF-a receptor and

Multiple sclerosis

Damage in the brain in multiple sclerosis (MS) is conven­
tionally thought to follow an orderly cycle of inflammation
(presumed to have an autoimmune element), tissue damage
and then fibrosis, leaving tissue with naked but intact axons
which conduct nerve impulses only poorly. This is probably
an oversimplification. In particular, axon damage may occur
relatively early in the disease process. The apparently
critical part played by inflammation in the pathogenesis of
MS suggests a role for anti-inflammatory agents in therapy,
exemplified by the use of interferon beta, an anti­
inflammatory agent which reduces microglial cell class II
expression. Interferon beta has been shown, in four trials, to
reduce clinical relapse rate by one third. There is a more
marked effect on surrogate markers of disease severity such
as numbers of gadolinium enhancing brain lesions on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. The relevance
of this effect on hard clinical markers is, however, less clear.
A trial of the effect of interferon beta on the progressive
phase of the disease suggests a modest beneficial effect.

Our increasing appreciation that the inflammatory
response plays a critical role in both the (helpful) repair as
well as the (harmful) effector phase of the auto-immune
process in MS means that approaches targeted more
specifically at the autoreactive T-cell response (exclusively
harmful) using the humanised mouse monoclonal antibody
anti-CD52, a profoundly effective T-cell depleting antibody
(whose effects can last for years following a week of treat­
ment), may be clinically more productive. Anti-CD52 treat­
ment reduces new brain lesion development (as assessed by
gadolinium enhancing lesions) and the development of new
clinical manifestations over 18 months following therapy.
Intriguingly, thyrotoxicity developed in a number of
patients treated with anti-CD 52 in the second year after
treatment. This was the only significant apparent side-effect
of the treatment. In contrast to the beneficial effects on the
induction of new lesions, progression of existing lesions
occurred in up to 50% of patients treated with anti-CD52.
Progression was associated, both before and during treat­
ment, with the presence of brain atrophy resulting from
axonal loss. The contrasting outcomes in treatment suggest
clearly that events related to the induction of new lesions
must be separated from the consequences of progression of
existing damage. The conclusion of trials which demon­
strate efficacy in modulating the former but not the latter is
that agents such as anti-CD52 should be used early in the
disease process, before the development of a significant
element of chronic oligodendrocyte loss likely to result in
progression of damage which is unresponsive to treatment.

The importance of the design of future clinical trials of new
therapies aimed at modulating fundamental immunological
processes is therefore clear.

Clinical trials and autoimmunity

The results achieved in these evolutionary trials emphasise
the importance of logical series of trials which build on the
results (beneficial or otherwise) of earlier trials. Although
the lure of new 'miracle' treatments for a particular disease
is great, it is often the case that learning to use the drugs
that are already available in an optimal fashion (through
the identification of appropriate patients, selection of the
correct dosing regimes, the use of logical drug combina­
tions and identifying the correct outcome measures for use
in a trial) provides greater patient benefit (at least in the
short term).

Antigen specific therapy

If antigen specific immune responses, orchestrated by CD4+
'helper' T-cell responses, are responsible for tissue damage
in autoimmune disease then perhaps, theoretically, the
most attractive approach to treatment is to target only those
cells and immune effectors which are specific for the
relevant autoantigen. This potentially has the advantage of
leaving the residual immune system intact, thereby, in
theory at least, reducing the adverse effects of therapy. The
vast majority of data available to date derive from animal
models, and in particular experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). Nasal administration of epitope

peptides derived from myelin basic protein (the dominant
autoantigen in EAE) can prevent the development of the
disease. Oral administration of antigen is less effective (an
issue of importance for the design of future human studies).
Of particular relevance for the use of antigen-specific
therapies in human disease is the observation that adminis­
tration of peptide by the nasal route after the induction of
disease has an appreciable disease ameliorating effect,
although it is clear that application at the earliest possible
point in the disease course is likely to generate the greatest
clinical effect.

Conclusion

We can draw three conclusions from this provocative meet­
ing. The first is that our understanding of the mechanisms
which lead to a failure of immune self-tolerance and result
in autoimmunity is increasing rapidly. The second is that
this increased understanding will generate many exciting
theoretical and experimental approaches to therapy. The
third is that the next stage in the process, the development
and assessment of such treatments for use in human
populations, may be the most difficult of all.
