FOREWORD

I am pleased to introduce the inaugural NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for Autoimmune
Disease  Research,  Fiscal  Years  2026–2030.  This  comprehensive  blueprint  is  a
manifestation  of  the  National
Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)'s  unwavering
commitment to address the chronic disease crisis in the U.S. and to improve the
health of the American people.

Autoimmune  diseases  inﬂuence  every  system  in  the  body  and  pose  signiﬁcant
risks  to  human  health  throughout  the  lifespan.  Between  23.5  and  50.0  million
people  in  America  live  with  one  or  more  autoimmune  diseases;  collectively,
autoimmune  diseases  represent  some  of  the  most  common  chronic  diseases
aﬀecting  the  U.S.  population.  Beyond  their  own  substantial  morbidity  and
mortality,  autoimmune  diseases  commonly  co-occur  with  other  debilitating
chronic  conditions.  These  ﬁndings  reinforce  the  observation  that  autoimmune
diseases touch the lives of every person in America.

Autoimmune diseases also carry substantial costs, estimated at more than $100
billion per year for health care in the U.S. Accounting for indirect costs, such as
lost productivity and the  broader impact on dependents, families, and society,
the costs to the American people are likely much higher.

The study of autoimmune diseases intersects with the mission of every Institute
and Center (IC) at NIH. While signiﬁcant progress has been and continues to be
made in autoimmune disease research across NIH, more work is needed to improve diagnostics and therapeutics and to
bring scientiﬁc discoveries to the bedside. This strategic plan proposes a coordinated approach that will foster a synergistic
environment where collaboration and innovation can ﬂourish.

The plan will prioritize research that addresses the health needs of the American people. By integrating the perspectives
and experiences of those living with autoimmune diseases, scientiﬁc inquiry will be tailored to focus on their most pressing
needs.  This  holistic  approach  will  not  only  enhance  understanding  of  disease  pathogenesis  but  also  expedite  the
development of novel therapies.

By enhancing reproducibility and rigor in research, as well as cultivating a culture of research safety, transparency, and
academic  freedom,  this  plan  underscores  the  importance  of  harnessing  cutting-edge  technologies  to  advance  science.
Recent  innovations  in  technology  and  bioinformatics  oﬀer  unprecedented  opportunities  to  dissect  the  molecular
underpinnings of autoimmune diseases at a scale never previously achievable. Leveraging these tools, we hope to optimize
collaborative  autoimmune  disease  research  eﬀorts;  bolster  infrastructure  and  resource  allocation;  and  support  basic,
clinical,  translational,  epidemiologic,  and  implementation  sciences.  This  strategic  approach  will  create  a  robust
infrastructure  to  support  interdisciplinary  research  consortia  pivotal  for  accelerating  scientiﬁc  breakthroughs  and
supporting future autoimmune disease researchers.

The  plan  is  a  testament  to  NIH’s  dedication  to  advance  human  health.  Through  a  collaborative  approach,  innovative
thinking, and a steadfast focus on outcomes that impact human health, we are poised to make signiﬁcant strides in the
ﬁght against autoimmune diseases. It is our hope that this plan will serve as a catalyst for transformative change, ultimately
improving the lives of all people living with and at risk of autoimmune diseases.

NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030

OVERVIEW OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

The human immune system operates in a state of balance. It increases activity in response to external threats, such as the
many infections and external stimuli encountered over the life course, and decreases activity when the infectious trigger
or stimulus has resolved. The immune system constantly surveys for external and internal threats such as infections and
malignant cells—traﬃcking into all organs and systems and distinguishing self from non-self, which is a concept termed
“tolerance.”

Autoimmunity occurs when the body’s immune tolerance breaks down and the immune system generates autoreactive
antibodies,  cells,  cytokines,  and  other  molecules  that  react  against  components  of  healthy  cells  and  tissues.  The
development of autoimmunity may occur years prior to clinical signs and symptoms of autoimmune disease; yet some
individuals with evidence of autoimmunity never develop clinical disease.

Autoimmune diseases develop when autoreactive antibodies, cells, and molecules cause damage to organs or tissues that
results in signs and symptoms. Autoimmune diseases are an incredibly diverse group of conditions, aﬀecting almost any
part of the body and manifesting across the life course. More than 140 known autoimmune diseases have been identiﬁed,
and symptoms vary extensively based on the organs involved and disease type.1 Because the immune system traﬃcs into
every  organ,  autoimmune  diseases  may  impact  any  system  in  the  body  and  may  also  aﬀect  multiple  systems
simultaneously.

Most  autoimmune  diseases  are  chronic,  but  the  presentation  may  be  acute.  They  may  be  organ-  or  life-threatening.
Symptoms of many autoimmune diseases wax and wane over time. The unpredictability of ﬂares, periods during which
symptoms worsen, can be extremely challenging to manage, and although many autoimmune diseases are now treatable,
most autoimmune diseases do not have curative interventions.

Autoimmune diseases are believed to aﬀect 7% to 8% of the U.S. population, between 23.5 and 50.0 million Americans
are estimated to be living with autoimmune diseases. Rates of autoimmunity are increasing; however, the exact prevalence
of autoimmune diseases in the U.S. is unknown because of the absence of comprehensive longitudinal data.2-4

Because of their breadth and complexity, the study of autoimmune diseases intersects with the mission of every National
Institutes of Health (NIH) Institute and Center (IC), underscoring the need for an NIH-wide approach for strategic planning
for autoimmune disease research.

The mission of the NIH-wide Strategic Plan for Autoimmune Disease Research
is to coordinate and advance eﬀorts to support rigorous, high-priority,
innovative, and collaborative autoimmune disease research.

Preclinical Autoimmunity

A common feature of many autoimmune diseases is a period of asymptomatic autoimmunity—the prodrome—typically
manifested by detection of autoantibodies or other markers of immune activation. This period is followed by development
of  symptoms,  which  may  be  initially  nonspeciﬁc,  and  then  progress  to  clinical  disease  (Figure  1).  The  duration  of  the
prodrome varies. Research has shown that autoantibodies may predate clinically deﬁnable disease by more than ﬁve years
in people who ultimately are diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases.5,6 Similarly,
in diseases such as multiple sclerosis, the prodrome may last a decade or longer before an individual meets criteria for a
formal diagnosis. During this period, autoimmunity can be pathogenic and cause organ damage. In some diseases, such as
type I diabetes in children, the prodrome tends to be shorter. The period of asymptomatic autoimmunity presents a unique
opportunity to evaluate immunomodulatory therapies before disease fully develops. Recent groundbreaking research has
led to the approval of a new therapy for delaying progression to type I diabetes in high-risk individuals.7 This marks the
ﬁrst Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for delaying progression in preclinical autoimmunity. Importantly,
this  success  oﬀers  tantalizing  evidence  that  a  similar  preventative  approach  might  be  possible  for  other  chronic
autoimmune diseases.

OVERVIEW OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

Figure 1. Many autoimmune diseases have a period of asymptomatic or preclinical autoimmunity, known as the prodrome,
prior to the development of clinically deﬁnable disease.

Living with Autoimmune Diseases

In  addition  to  managing  the  chronicity  of  autoimmune  disease,  people  living  with  autoimmune  diseases  and  their
caregivers face challenges that extend beyond the disease itself. Reaching an accurate autoimmune disease diagnosis is
challenging and may take months to years, despite frequent oﬃce visits to experienced physicians. The long timeline to
diagnosis is due to many factors, including the nonspeciﬁc prodromal symptoms seen early in autoimmune disease and
lack  of  robust  diagnostic  tests  for  autoimmunity.  Extended  diagnostic  uncertainty  contributes  additional  mental  and
psychosocial stress over and above that caused from the chronicity of autoimmune diseases. However, studies show that
timely diagnosis and early targeted treatment typically result in better outcomes for people with autoimmune diseases.8
Therefore, advancing research into improving diagnostic testing for autoimmunity is essential.

Even with an accurate diagnosis, many people with autoimmune diseases face a lifetime of disease ﬂares and treatments,
with associated side eﬀects and complications. Disease ﬂares can occur without warning. These sudden, unpredictable
increases in disease activity can impair physical, mental, and cognitive functioning, both for the person experiencing the
ﬂares and their support network. Recommended lifestyle and dietary changes can be arduous and diﬃcult to navigate.
Improving understanding of ﬂares in autoimmune diseases is a crucial step in advancing autoimmune disease research.


NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030

OVERVIEW OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

Many treatments for autoimmune diseases involve complex regimens, including pills and injectable therapies. Treatment
can  lead  to  side  eﬀects  such  as  becoming  immunocompromised,  which  makes  the  person  receiving  these  treatments
vulnerable to infections. Treatments also carry other complications and necessitate signiﬁcant time and costs. For many
autoimmune diseases, treatment options remain extremely limited and may not fully halt disease progression. However,
recent scientiﬁc advances  have demonstrated  that targeted treatment is possible for some autoimmune diseases, and
more research is needed to accelerate the development of additional therapies, drug combinations, dosing regimens, and
delivery methods to improve treatment, prevention, and cure.9

Eﬀorts are needed across the research continuum to improve outcomes and reduce the challenges experienced by people
living  with  autoimmune  diseases.  Moving  forward,  research  is  warranted  in  several  key  areas:  improving  diagnostics;
predicting disease progression and ﬂares; addressing the psychosocial impacts of living with an autoimmune disease; and
accelerating  development  of  new  treatments  and  preventative  interventions,  including  optimizing  drug  combinations,
dosing regimens, and delivery methods.

Co-Occurring Autoimmune Diseases
People living with one autoimmune disease have a high likelihood of developing additional autoimmune diseases.4 It is
also  common  for  multiple  individuals  within  the  same  family  to  be  aﬀected  with  diﬀerent  autoimmune  diseases.  The
reasons for these phenomena are unknown, but the observation inherently suggests the existence of commonalities in
disease pathogenesis and shared risk factors that predispose to autoimmunity. Traditional research paradigms challenge
the ability of investigators to study co-occurring conditions because people living with multiple autoimmune diseases are
often  excluded  from  research  trials.  Studies  of  co-occurring  autoimmune  diseases  often  fall  outside  of  a  single  NIH
Institute’s  scientiﬁc  mission  area,  which  highlights  the  unmet  need  for  a  coordinated  NIH-Wide  Strategic  Plan  for
Autoimmune Disease Research.

Risk Factors for Autoimmune Diseases

Although many autoimmune diseases occur in genetically susceptible individuals, inherited genetics alone cannot explain
the rapidly increasing incidence and prevalence of autoimmune diseases.2,10 The importance of somatic mutations has
recently become apparent,11-13 and experts generally agree that exposures and triggers throughout the life course likely
contribute to development of autoimmunity.14

Exposome research is the study of the various exposures experienced by humans throughout their lives.15,16 The exposome
encompasses internal and external exposures, such as diet, stress, hormones, alcohol, drugs, medication, cigarette smoke,
chemicals, heavy metals, ultraviolet radiation, air and water pollutants, and indirect health indicators, such as education,
social conditions, or job security (Figure 2). The microbiome, which is the collection of all microbes (including bacteria,
fungi, viruses, and parasites) that live on and inside our bodies, also contributes to the exposome and may aﬀect how
autoimmune diseases develop and manifest. The unique and dynamic composition of microbes that are present or absent
during an individual’s life course inﬂuences their immune function in health and disease.

In 2010, an  NIH-convened expert panel established consensus  on the associations between autoimmune diseases and
various environmental exposures such as crystalline silica, solvents, and other chemical exposures as well as smoking and
radiation.17,18 However, the study of environmental exposures in autoimmune diseases is challenging, in part because of
exposure latency and the spatiotemporal variability in exposures and because exposures may have diﬀerent inﬂuences
depending on the life stage of the individual. For example, exposures during childhood and adolescence may have a more
pronounced impact than those later in life, or vice versa, depending on the agent involved. The inﬂuence of psychosocial
stressors and behavioral factors may also play a role in autoimmunity, either independently or in conjunction with other
environmental  factors.  The  study  of  cumulative  and  time-varying  exposures,  along  with  their  interactions  over  the  life
course, requires complex analytic modeling. These dynamic, interconnected components of the exposome can be very
diﬃcult  to  integrate  into  research  but  are  critically  important  to  understand—especially  because  their  impact  may  be
disproportionate in diﬀerent groups.

NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030


OVERVIEW OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

Studying cohorts of people at risk of autoimmunity, and people with diﬀerent autoimmune diseases, over time is important
to  inform  understanding  of  the  interplay  of  time-varying  exposures  on  the  immune  system.  Cross-sectional  studies  of
individuals  with  rare  diseases  can  also  help  to  reveal  how  the  immune  system  functions  in  health  and  disease.  A
coordinated approach to autoimmune disease research would enable integration and analysis of the interactions between
various environmental exposures and biologic systems over the lifespan. Through advances in predictive modeling and
other data analytics, such research will improve identiﬁcation of individuals and populations at risk of autoimmunity and
help identify new strategies for intervention.

Figure 2. The exposome encompasses many exposures experienced across the lifespan, including those from the physical
environment,  social  environment,  and  lifestyle.  Figure  adapted  from  the  National  Institute  of  Environmental  Health
Sciences.

OVERVIEW OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

Variations in Autoimmune Diseases

Autoimmune diseases are more common in women and individuals with chromosomal abnormalities including trisomy-21
(also known as Down syndrome) and other aneuploidies;19 greater than 80% of those aﬀected are female. Autoimmune
diseases  also  occur  in  men,  and  in  some  cases,  men  experience  more  severe  disease  course  and  a  higher  risk  of
mortality.20,21 There are multiple biologic reasons for these diﬀerences. Women are known to exhibit more robust immune
responses to pathogens.22 Recent data also suggest that the biologic inactivation of additional X-chromosomes by long
noncoding ribonucleic acid molecules, including the X-inactive speciﬁc transcript (XIST), may play a role in the observed
sex-speciﬁc  variation  across  autoimmune  diseases.23  The  biology  of  autoimmunity  needs  further  research  to  better
understand autoimmune disease pathogenesis.

Autoimmune Disease Across Different Populations

Although most autoimmune diseases aﬀect people of all backgrounds, some populations are disproportionately aﬀected
and  have  worse  outcomes.24,25  The  reasons  for  this  disproportionate  burden  are  not  fully  understood;  to  ensure  that
scientiﬁc  discoveries  beneﬁt  all  populations,  research  studies  should  enroll  individuals  from  all  communities.26-28  In
addition, environmental exposures and life events also diﬀer over the life course and across geographical areas. These
variables should be incorporated into autoimmune disease research29 so that the scientiﬁc knowledge gained is widely
applicable.

Autoimmunity as a Risk Factor for Other Comorbid Conditions

The eﬀects of autoimmunity are numerous and can have wide-reaching consequences. For example, chronic inﬂammation,
part of the pathophysiology of many autoimmune diseases, is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.30 In
addition, many people with autoimmune diseases develop mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety.31 Data
increasingly signal that these comorbidities are not simply related to the diﬃculties of living with a chronic disease; rather,
inﬂammation may contribute to the development of systemic complications.32,33 Thus, the proposed coordinated approach
to advancing autoimmune disease research, outlined in this NIH-wide plan, may catalyze scientiﬁc understanding in other
complex diseases and have far-reaching impact across all communities.

Patient Partnership for Autoimmune Disease Research

The engagement of people living with autoimmune diseases has been an essential component in the development of this
strategic plan and will remain a priority for NIH. People living with autoimmune diseases, individuals and organizations
advocating for patients, caregivers, and autoimmune disease-focused clinicians and scientists all bring unique perspectives
and  contribute  to  the  goal  of  advancing  fundamental  knowledge  and  applying  that  knowledge  to  improve  the  lives  of
people  living  with  autoimmune  diseases.  NIH  is  dedicated  to  synergizing  eﬀorts  to  advance  scientiﬁc  discovery  for
autoimmune diseases and translating those ﬁndings into meaningful interventions for prevention, diagnosis, treatment,
and cure of autoimmune diseases.

Community Networks for Autoimmune Disease Research

The many existing community networks and disease-speciﬁc advocacy groups are a unique and important resource for
people living with autoimmune diseases and those engaged in autoimmune disease research and care. Across the research
continuum, engagement with community networks is essential to enhancing innovation, catalyzing breakthroughs, and
disseminating and implementing new ﬁndings in the community. Many autoimmune diseases are also considered rare
diseases because they aﬀect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. As exempliﬁed in the rare disease community, networks
are an incredible resource—often serving a synergistic role of supporting people living with autoimmune diseases and
supporting research through expanding clinical trial access, advancing understanding of diseases and their complications
through  coordinated  natural  history  studies,  and  disseminating  research  ﬁndings.  Dissemination  and  implementation
research  is  important  to  enhance  uptake  of  evidence-based,  person-centered  research  ﬁndings.  Developing  and

NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030


OVERVIEW OF AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES

strengthening relationships with community networks is a cornerstone to ensuring that autoimmune disease research is
person-centered and reaches all communities.

Enhancing Capacity for Autoimmune Disease Research

Training and retaining the autoimmune disease research scientiﬁc workforce will remain critically important for supporting
the future of autoimmune disease research. Pre-COVID-19 data from the American College of Rheumatology Workforce
Survey demonstrated that multiple regions of the U.S. will have a critical shortage of rheumatologists by 2030,34 and the
pressures of the pandemic and its aftermath will only exacerbate these shortfalls. Similar trends have been observed in
other autoimmune disease-focused specialties and impact the ability to not only advance fundamental research but also
conduct the clinical trials needed to translate new discoveries into clinical practice.35 A strategic approach is needed to
dovetail initiatives that support training, sustaining, and re-engaging the autoimmune disease research workforce across
the research continuum in parallel with advancing the science.

Advancing Autoimmune Disease Research

NIH  is  committed  to  advancing  progress  in  autoimmune  disease  research  and  care.  NIH  will  continue  to  support  the
fundamental research that is essential for identifying new therapeutic targets and translating these discoveries into clinical
treatments that ultimately improve the health of people living with autoimmune diseases. Through the implementation
of this strategic plan, NIH will support all phases of the scientiﬁc process, adopting a coordinated approach to autoimmune
disease research and integrating fundamental, translational, epidemiological, clinical, and implementation science.  As the
research accelerates, NIH will continue to build capacity for autoimmune disease research through the development of
advanced tools, techniques, and methods, as well as a skilled workforce to deftly deliver new discoveries to the bedside.
These priorities are essential for advancing and translating scientiﬁc discoveries into practical applications that improve
outcomes for people living with and at risk of autoimmune disease. Through a collaborative and coordinated approach,
encompassing scientiﬁc integrity and rigor, this NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for Autoimmune Disease Research will serve as a
framework for priority setting for autoimmune disease research across NIH over the next ﬁve years.

The Office of Autoimmune Disease Research

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (Public Law 117-328) provided the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with
funds to establish the Oﬃce of Autoimmune Disease Research in the Oﬃce of Research on Women’s Health (OADR-
ORWH) to enhance coordination across NIH autoimmune disease research eﬀorts.

In addition to calling upon NIH to establish OADR, Congress set out the following six directives for the new oﬃce:

1.  Coordinate the development of a multi-IC strategic research plan with concrete, meaningful milestones to set

priorities
Identify emerging areas of innovation and research opportunity

3.  Coordinate and foster collaborative research across ICs
4.  Annually evaluate the autoimmune disease research portfolio to determine progress made across NIH
5.  Provide resources to support planning, collaboration, and innovation
6.  Develop and oversee a publicly accessible central repository for autoimmune disease research

Coordinating Committee for Autoimmune Disease Research (CCADR)

The Coordinating Committee for Autoimmune Disease Research (CCADR) is an NIH committee convened in support of
autoimmune disease research at NIH. CCADR members include NIH Institute, Center, and Oﬃce (ICO) representatives
nominated by ICO Directors (Appendix A).

PRIORITY SETTING AND STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS

Development of the NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for Autoimmune Disease Research began in 2023 with the formation of the
Oﬃce  of  Autoimmune  Disease  Research  in  the  Oﬃce  of  Research  on  Women’s  Health  (OADR-ORWH).  In  the  Joint
Explanatory  Statement  accompanying  the  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act,  2023,  Congress  also  directed  the  Oﬃce  to
coordinate  the  development  of  this  NIH-wide  strategic  plan.  OADR-ORWH  convened  an  internal  NIH  Coordinating
Committee  for  Autoimmune  Disease  Research  (CCADR)  with  representatives  from  across  NIH  Institutes,  Centers,  and
Oﬃces (ICOs), which then formed a Strategic Plan Working Group (SPWG, Appendix B).

OADR-ORWH’s  process  for  strategic  planning  and  priority  setting  emphasized  input  from  autoimmune  disease
communities.  In  December  2023,  in  coordination  with  the  SPWG,  OADR-ORWH  developed  and  issued  a  Request  for
Information (RFI; NOT-OD-24-049) that requested input from the public on the development of the strategic plan. OADR-
ORWH also hosted two community roundtables in February 2024 to garner input from academic and patient advocacy
partners.

The SPWG met regularly to establish the priorities, objectives, and crosscutting themes. SPWG members evaluated and
integrated  data  from  multiple  sources  including  (a)  responses  to  the  RFI,  (b)  dialogues  at  the  community  roundtable
sessions, (c) input from NIH ICO representatives and directors, (d) data from public health organizations, (e) analysis of the
existing NIH autoimmune disease research portfolio, and (f) recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report on Enhancing NIH Research on Autoimmune Disease and other reports (Figure
3).

The NIH common template was used to guide the strategic planning process and to identify and develop research priorities,
capacity priorities, and operational priorities, as well as crosscutting themes.

Figure 3. Strategic planning and priority setting emphasized input from multiple sources including the autoimmune disease
community.

NIH AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH PORTFOLIO

NIH supports a broad range of basic to clinical research on autoimmunity and autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune disease
research is conducted and supported across various NIH ICOs in alignment with their mission areas.

To support the development of the NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for Autoimmune Disease Research, OADR-ORWH conducted a
baseline landscape analysis of NIH’s autoimmune disease research portfolio. For the purposes of this analysis, more than
140 diseases and conditions (Figure 4) included in the NASEM report and considered to be either autoimmune or to coexist
with autoimmune diseases were reviewed.1 An additional crosscutting category of fundamental immunology research has
been included in the analysis because understanding autoimmune diseases requires a holistic view of the immune system,
which  cannot  be  achieved  without  studying  relevant  fundamental  immune  mechanisms.  This  analysis  informed  the
strategic  priorities  by  providing  data-driven  insights  on  gaps  within  the  portfolio  and  fostered  consensus  on  strategic
objectives.

Although NIH’s investment in autoimmune disease research increased from $800 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2018 to more
than  $1  billion  in  FY22,36  continued  and  sustained  funding  is  necessary  to  fully  address  the  breadth  and  depth  of  the
autoimmune  disease  research  portfolio.  The  current  funding  levels  are  not  proportional  to  the  rising  prevalence  of
autoimmune diseases, highlighting a signiﬁcant gap that must be addressed. The autoimmune disease research portfolio
serves as a vital reference for pinpointing areas that require additional investment to ensure comprehensive advances and
impactful progress in the ﬁeld of autoimmune disease research.

Figure 4. The autoimmune disease research portfolio encompasses more than 140 diﬀerent diseases and conditions
across 15 disease areas aligned by organ system and/or mechanism as well as a crosscutting category of fundamental
immunology research (see also Appendix B).

NIH STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

Five strategic priorities, each supported by four objectives, constitute the foundation of the NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for
Autoimmune Disease Research. The priorities and objectives were identiﬁed through input from across the autoimmune
disease community and reﬁned by NIH ICO representatives and subject matter experts in autoimmunity and autoimmune
diseases.  The  ﬁve  priorities  and  their  respective  objectives  as  well  as  ﬁve  crosscutting  themes  will  guide  NIH-wide
autoimmune disease research and are intended to supplement relevant ICO mission areas (Figure 5).

Figure  5.  The  NIH-Wide  Strategic  Plan  for  Autoimmune  Disease  Research  consists  of  ﬁve  strategic  priorities  and  ﬁve
crosscutting themes that will guide NIH-wide autoimmune disease research in FY26–FY30.

NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030


NIH STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

PRIORITY  1.  Accelerate  scientific  discovery  in  diagnosis,  treatment,  prevention,  and
cure of autoimmune diseases

Advances in basic science research are critical to improving fundamental understanding of autoimmunity and autoimmune
diseases,  catalyzing  novel  clinical  research,  and  translating  knowledge  into  meaningful  results  for  people  living  with
autoimmune diseases, at-risk populations, and their communities. Disease pathogenesis and the mechanisms that drive
autoimmune  disease  development,  symptoms,  and  ﬂares  are  poorly  understood.  Exploring  these  areas  with  a  critical
appreciation  for  commonalities  across  and  diﬀerences  within  autoimmune  diseases  will  illuminate  new  approaches  to
advance the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and cure of autoimmune diseases.

OBJECTIVES

1.1  Support research into fundamental mechanisms of autoimmunity and autoimmune disease

Understanding  autoimmune  disease  mechanisms,  pathways,  and  crosscutting  characteristics  is  critical  to  progressing
scientiﬁc  discovery  and  innovation  in  autoimmune  disease  diagnostics,  prevention,  and  intervention.  Supporting
fundamental research into mechanisms of disease initiation and progression, including genetic and environmental drivers,
disease subsets, biomarkers, and potential treatment targets, will advance opportunities to inform therapies and precision
medicine, better understand disproportionate risk among populations, and apply knowledge and clinical developments
across multiple autoimmune diseases.

1.2  Advance understanding of drivers of autoimmune disease signs, symptoms, and ﬂares

Autoimmune  disease  signs  and  symptoms  are  wide  ranging  and  often  wax  and  wane  over  time.  Many  autoimmune
diseases are characterized by ﬂares—episodes during which the severity of symptoms worsens dramatically. Mechanisms
of ﬂares are not well understood, and frequency and severity of ﬂares may vary in diﬀerent populations. Research that
includes  representation  from  all  populations  and  age  groups  is  needed  to  understand  the  pathogenesis  of  disease
manifestations  and  the  mechanisms  and  drivers  of  ﬂares.  Furthermore,  a  life-course  perspective  will  support  the
examination  of  factors  that  ﬂuctuate  over  time  and  may  contribute  to  autoimmune  disease  ﬂares,  such  as  hormonal
changes and environmental inﬂuences.

1.3  Optimize development of research models for studying autoimmune disease

Representative, accurate research models that mimic human structure and function are critical for studying the basics of
autoimmunity and autoimmune disease. Animal models are often used to study autoimmunity; however, these models
are  an  imperfect  representation  of  human  disease.  The  development  and  reﬁnement  of  research  models  for  studying
autoimmune diseases is crucial to advance autoimmune disease research. This eﬀort may include the use of animal and
non-animal models, organoids, and enhanced computational modeling, such as digital twins. Naturally occurring genetic
abnormalities and drug-induced autoimmunity also oﬀer a unique opportunity for studying the inception of autoimmunity
in humans.

1.4

Improve understanding of predictors and risk factors for autoimmunity across the lifespan

Autoimmune diseases are aﬀected by numerous variables, including individual biology, environment, geographic factors,
infections,  and  life  events,  which  may  evolve,  ﬂuctuate,  and  compound  over  time.  Accelerating  autoimmune  disease
research  requires  integration  of  multiomic  data  from  multiple  sources.  Multidimensional  and  longitudinal  analysis  of
autoimmunity from pre-disease through clinical disease is needed to understand the progression, coexisting morbidities,
and long-term outcomes of autoimmune diseases. Such analytics will enable scientists to integrate complex time-varying
exposures, such as indirect health indicators and risks and exposures across the lifespan; identify common characteristics
of autoimmune diseases; and understand the complex relationships driving autoimmune diseases.


NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030

NIH STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

PRIORITY 2. Promote research focused on enhancing health for people living with and
at risk of autoimmune diseases

For  people  living  with  autoimmune  diseases,  early  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  intervention  are  crucial.  Autoimmune
diseases  are  chronic  and  may  cause  irreversible  damage  to  multiple  tissues  and  organs,  with  debilitating  physical,
psychosocial, and mental eﬀects. Early intervention may help delay or prevent progression and reduce tissue and organ
damage.  However,  delays  in  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  autoimmune  diseases  are  common.  To  support  tangible
improvements in health for people living with autoimmune diseases, research focused on developing accurate diagnostics
and eﬀective treatments that are accessible and deployable in real-world settings are needed.

OBJECTIVES

2.1  Support research investigating preclinical autoimmunity

Autoimmunity often develops years prior to presentation of clinical symptoms. This asymptomatic period is known as the
prodrome of autoimmune disease. The prodrome oﬀers scientists a window to understand human immune responses to
exposures  and  other  triggers,  advancing  scientiﬁc  knowledge  of  disease  pathogenesis  and  oﬀering  opportunities  to
intervene before disease manifests. Research focused on examining preclinical autoimmunity and drivers of autoimmune
disease in all populations will be crucial to prevent and reverse autoimmunity and promote health.

2.2  Advance research to accelerate accurate diagnosis of autoimmune disease

An accurate autoimmune disease diagnosis may take years to reach and involve multiple health care interactions. Delays
in diagnosis allow disease to progress unchecked, sometimes causing irreparable damage. Research is needed to develop
novel diagnostics that reduce the time to diagnosis and tools to predict complications and ﬂares. It is essential to support
biomarker discovery and the development of new technologies, such as point-of-care testing, imaging technology, sensors,
and wearable technologies. Additionally, integrating predictive modeling tools into longitudinal and epidemiologic studies
is important for improving disease diagnosis.

2.3  Bolster research focused on improving treatment for autoimmune disease

Treatments  for  autoimmune  diseases  may  carry  side  eﬀects  and  are  frequently  complex,  involving  time-consuming
therapies, complicated medication regimens, and often with intravenous or injectable delivery methods. These factors
contribute to nonadherence, which ultimately reduces treatment eﬃcacy. To advance this ﬁeld, research is needed into
innovative therapies, tools and tests that help predict treatment responses, and improved drug delivery options. It is also
critical to support research into the impact of psychosocial factors on health, and to study interventions that may improve
quality of life—including therapeutic and nonmedical interventions—to enhance health and longevity for people living
with autoimmune diseases.

2.4  Support implementation science for autoimmune disease research across all populations

Implementation science, focused on the uptake of research into clinical practice, is essential for ensuring that scientiﬁc
ﬁndings are applied eﬀectively and eﬃciently in a real-world setting. Studies are needed to assess how treatments for
autoimmune diseases are implemented in practice, examine factors that contribute to low disease activity and remission,
and to reduce direct and indirect costs associated with autoimmune diseases.

NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030


NIH STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

PRIORITY 3. Support research to understand the full complexity of autoimmune
diseases

The incidence of autoimmune diseases is rising globally, and there are many gaps in understanding of how autoimmune
diseases aﬀect health across the lifespan. Longitudinal, cross-sectional, and other epidemiologic study of populations from
before  disease manifests through the course of disease are needed to advance understanding of autoimmune disease
development,  progression,  and  impact  across  all  facets  of  daily  life.  Short-  and  long-term  outcomes  are  inﬂuenced  by
numerous  variables,  including  access  to  and  complications  from  treatment.  Genetics,  microbiome,  hormonal  changes,
internal and external environmental exposures, and indirect health indicators may all play a role in autoimmunity inception
and long-term outcomes.

OBJECTIVES

3.1  Support the study of human cohorts for autoimmune disease research

Longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts provide opportunities to follow groups of people with autoimmune diseases over
time and to study diﬀerences between individuals that develop disease and those that do not. Cohorts enable investigators
to study disease-speciﬁc phenotypes and the natural history of disease progression and complications over time. Through
multidimensional analysis, researchers will gain insights into the complex interaction of genomics and exposomics across
the  lifespan  that  contribute  to  autoimmune  disease  development,  progression,  complications,  and  ﬂares.  These
interactions may include genetic factors, environmental exposures, microbial factors, indirect health indicators, and other
variables.  The  study  of  diﬀerent  cohorts  will  provide  a  foundation  for  development  of  predictive  models  to  identify
individuals and populations at risk of autoimmune disease, with a view to enabling strategic approaches to alter disease
progression.

3.2  Promote research to understand how diﬀerent populations are aﬀected by autoimmune diseases

Prevalence of autoimmune diseases varies across populations. Autoimmune diseases also occur in children, presenting
unique  challenges in both  diagnosis and care. Improved  understanding of the diﬀerences in disease across and within
populations may identify opportunities for prevention, treatment, and cure of autoimmunity. It is important to study new
and  established  cohorts  of  people  encompassing  the  spectrum  of  autoimmune  diseases  and  individuals  from  all
backgrounds and ages. Data generated through these studies will advance understanding of the complex, bidirectional
relationships  observed  in  autoimmunity,  including  between  clinical  proﬁles,  health  indicators,  and  life  events,  such  as
adolescence, pregnancy, midlife, menopause, and aging.

3.3  Advance research that will facilitate clinical trials for autoimmune diseases

Clinical trials are essential to bringing discoveries from the laboratory to the clinic and to accelerating the development of
new  treatments  for  autoimmune  diseases.  Data  from  observational,  cross-sectional,  and  longitudinal  cohort  studies  in
autoimmune diseases can aid the design of clinical trials for novel therapies and preventive strategies. Harnessing the use
of data science modalities and of adaptive, pragmatic clinical trial designs, including basket trials, adaptive trials, cluster
trials, parallel randomized trials, and registry-embedded trials, will enable more eﬃcient recruitment and completion of
clinical trials in autoimmune diseases.

3.4  Expand autoimmune disease research focused on co-occurring and comorbid conditions

People  living  with  an  autoimmune  disease  often  develop  co-occurring  autoimmune  diseases  and  are  at  risk  for  other
comorbidities. Research that examines new and known co-occurring and comorbid conditions, risk factors for developing
comorbidities,  their  impact  on  autoimmune  disease  progression,  and  long-term  outcomes  for  people  living  with
autoimmune diseases is crucial to understanding how these coexisting and comorbid relationships vary in populations,
and how autoimmunity progresses across the lifespan.


NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030

NIH STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

PRIORITY 4. Build and maintain capacity for autoimmune disease research

Development of infrastructure and the scientiﬁc workforce are important to ensure that high-priority autoimmune disease
research can be executed and to further accelerate the translation of scientiﬁc discoveries into improvements in health.
Scaling infrastructure to growing needs and adapting to rapid advancements in science on an ongoing basis will be crucial
for the future of autoimmune disease research.

OBJECTIVES

4.1  Prioritize and support development of infrastructure for autoimmune disease research

Infrastructure  is  needed  to  support  autoimmune  disease  research  from  discovery  to  implementation.  Building  and
maintaining research pipelines and collaborative networks will facilitate the management and coordination of all aspects
of  research  including  molecular  discovery,  drug  development,  deployment  of  biologic  and  cellular  therapies,  and
recruitment and retention in longitudinal registries and population cohorts. By prioritizing the development of research
infrastructure and ensuring its continued support, the discovery of new mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets
will be accelerated.

4.2

Integrate clinical trial networks and registries in autoimmune disease research

Clinical trial networks are organized systems of clinicians, scientists, and institutions that span multiple sites and have a
shared goal to accelerate scientiﬁc progress. Development of new networks as well as expansion and integration of existing
clinical  trial  networks  and  registries,  will  support  research  to  advance  progress  in  autoimmune  disease  prevention,
diagnosis,  treatment,  and  cure.  Supported  research  may  include  studies  that  validate  biomarkers,  deploy  novel
therapeutics,  conduct  imaging  studies,  identify  best  clinical  practices,  and  identify  important  commonalities  across
autoimmune  diseases.  Clinical  trial  and  other  networks  encourage  interaction  between  researchers,  clinicians,  people
living  with  autoimmune  diseases,  caregivers,  and  community  organizations—facilitating  multidisciplinary  collaboration
and reducing barriers to access clinical trials. Expanding network infrastructure will provide a foundation to accelerate
autoimmune disease research and to promote preclinical and clinical progress.

4.3  Develop data science and computational tools to accelerate autoimmune disease research

Although large quantities of autoimmune disease data exist, they are often under-utilized for many reasons. Robust data
science  and  advanced  computational  tools  are  necessary  to  collect,  manage,  integrate,  analyze,  and  further  utilize
substantial  amounts  of  autoimmune  disease  data.  Foundational  components  of  data  integration  include  deﬁning
ontologies and common data elements to harmonize datasets and leveraging computational models to integrate multiomic
proﬁles  across  diseases  over  time  to  better  understand  the  human  immunome  and  autoimmunity  across  the  lifespan.
Investing  in  foundational  data  platforms  for  autoimmune  disease  research  will  enable  NIH  to  support  development  of
modeling  pipelines,  federated  data  platforms  and  analytical  tools  such  as  machine  learning,  and  other  computational
approaches to accelerate autoimmune disease research.

4.4  Support eﬀorts to develop and sustain the scientiﬁc workforce

Developing a scientiﬁc workforce is imperative to drive autoimmune science forward. A skilled workforce includes basic,
translational, clinical, computational, and multidisciplinary scientists capable of supporting novel interventions. Bolstering
the research workforce pipeline requires training and support for new investigators, eﬀorts to retain established scientists,
and ongoing eﬀorts to ensure that the workforce adapts to evolving scientiﬁc progress. This is necessary to enable NIH to
gather varied perspectives, catalyze innovation, and support building trust in the scientiﬁc community.

NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030


NIH STRATEGIC PRIORITIES FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

PRIORITY  5.  Build  and  strengthen  partnerships  and  interdisciplinary  collaboration
across the autoimmune disease community

Developing and maintaining partnerships and opportunities for collaboration across the autoimmune disease community
is  crucial  to  stimulate  innovation  in  the  research  process.  Autoimmune  disease  research  inherently  beneﬁts  from
interdisciplinary  expertise  because  of  complex  risk  factors,  shared  crosscutting  characteristics,  and  the  fact  that
autoimmune  diseases  are  often  systemic  and  commonly  co-occur.  Scientiﬁc  advances  require  engagement  and
collaboration across the autoimmune disease community, including people living with autoimmune diseases, advocates,
caregivers,  academic  researchers,  health  care  professionals,  philanthropic  organizations,  industry  partners,  and  federal
entities. NIH is committed to supporting these partnerships to advance autoimmune disease research.

OBJECTIVES

5.1  Leverage public–private partnerships to support autoimmune disease research

Public–private  partnerships  bring  unique  opportunities  to  autoimmune  disease  research,  including  access  to  new
resources  and  technologies,  increased  logistical  support,  and  opportunities  to  advance  interdisciplinary  research.  By
building on current and fostering new partnerships, innovations in biomarker discovery, therapies, imaging and sensor
technology, and predictive tools for autoimmune disease will be accelerated.

5.2  Engage people living with autoimmune diseases, patient advocacy groups, and caregivers in research

People living with autoimmune diseases, patient advocacy groups, and caregivers are all essential community partners in
science,  providing  unique  perspectives  that  add  value  to  all  stages  of  autoimmune  disease  research.  Incorporating
community input throughout the research process accelerates research that is relevant, accessible, and implementable.
Dialogues with the autoimmune disease community will be established and maintained through regular updates, research
seminars, virtual roundtables and formal  RFIs. This engagement will ensure  that high-priority research is supported to
enhance outcomes for people with and aﬀected by autoimmune diseases.

5.3  Partner with people and communities disproportionately aﬀected by autoimmune disease outcomes

Building  strong  community  partnerships  that  include  populations  that  are  disproportionately  aﬀected  by  autoimmune
diseases  is  essential  to  establishing  a  robust  research  network.  Prioritizing  new  and  existing  partner  engagement,  will
ensure involvement of all individuals and perspectives in research by addressing challenges and barriers experienced by
these  communities.  Strengthening  community  networks  will  both  support  the  implementation  and  dissemination  of
research ﬁndings and beneﬁt public health.

5.4  Coordinate and foster collaborative research

To amplify existing research eﬀorts and create new opportunities, interdisciplinary collaborations through NIH-wide and
federal  interagency  partnerships  will  be  fostered,  along  with  opportunities  for  cross-ICO  partnership  in  autoimmune
disease research through research events, and other interdisciplinary activities.


NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030

CROSSCUTTING THEMES

Five crosscutting themes representing foundational concepts interwoven through the strategic plan were developed with
input from the autoimmune disease community to complement the strategic priorities and objectives. The crosscutting
themes echo the importance of rigorous and collaborative autoimmune disease research and dovetail with the NIH-Wide
Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2021–2025.

THEME 1: Harness technologies to advance autoimmune disease research
Advancing  and  harnessing  technologies  to  drive  scientiﬁc  progress  is  important  to  stimulate  research  and  improve
autoimmune disease outcomes. Advanced technologies, including artiﬁcial intelligence and systems biology approaches,
can  support  eﬀorts  to  improve  how  scientists  deﬁne  and  classify  autoimmune  diseases  at  a  molecular  level,  and  can
stimulate  groundbreaking  discoveries,  such  as  targeted  and  cell-based  therapies.  Imaging,  sensor,  and  wearable
technologies  can  aid  in  reducing  time  to  diagnosis  and  help  predict  disease  ﬂares.  New  point-of-care  technology  can
increase accessibility for patients with limited access to health care, and predictive modeling can be inﬂuential in devising
individualized  approaches  to  patient  screening  and  therapy.  By  supporting  technologies  in  research,  new  scientiﬁc
discoveries for autoimmune disease research will be catalyzed.

THEME 2: Develop infrastructure for translation of autoimmune disease research
Translational  science  bridges  fundamental  discovery  into  clinical  applications  and  supports  real-world  adoption  of
discovery  into  practice.  Optimizing  the  autoimmune  disease  research  environment  and  accelerating  translation  of
discovery into practice is essential for delivering improved outcomes for people living with and aﬀected by autoimmune
disease.  Autoimmune  disease  research  infrastructure  needs  will  grow  with  scientiﬁc  advances,  and  will  likely  include
clinical  trial  infrastructure,  workforce  training  and  re-entry  initiatives,  and  programmatic  opportunities  dedicated  to
promoting translational research. Digital infrastructure to manage, share, and analyze data from population cohorts to
accelerate new therapeutic interventions will also be critical for supporting autoimmune disease research.

THEME 3: Support multimodal data-driven approaches for autoimmune disease research
Autoimmune diseases are impacted by multiple factors. Individual biology, including genetics and epigenetics, play a role
in  autoimmunity.  It  is  also  well  established  that  the  exposome,  which  encompasses  the  many  variables  external  to  an
individual that ﬂuctuate and change over time, also plays a role in the development of autoimmune disease. Integrative
analysis of these complex interrelated and time-varying factors requires innovative analytic approaches including artiﬁcial
intelligence and systems biology methodologies. Integration of high-throughput data analytic platforms and innovative
approaches  to  advance  understanding  of  the  complex  multidimensional  data  generated  will  be  critical  to  support
autoimmune disease research.

THEME 4: Promote engagement of all populations in autoimmune disease research
Eﬀective  research  helps  conﬁrm  that  scientiﬁc  discoveries  are  applicable  across  all  populations.  Dedicated  eﬀorts  are
needed to ensure that all populations are accounted for during data analysis. Women and certain racial and ethnic groups
develop autoimmune diseases at disproportionate rates yet are historically underrepresented in research. In contrast when
men  develop  autoimmune  diseases,  they  often  have  worse  outcomes.  Rates  of  autoimmunity  are  also  increasing  in
children, a population often excluded from research. Environmental exposures and life events diﬀer across populations
and over the lifespan, and the relationships of exposures to autoimmune disease merit further study. Rigorous research
will support a clearer understanding of diﬀerences in autoimmunity across populations, the epidemiology of autoimmune
diseases, and the complex factors that inﬂuence autoimmune disease inception and progression.

THEME 5: Support community partnerships for autoimmune disease research
Ongoing partnerships and multidisciplinary collaborations, across and within autoimmune disease communities, are vital
to stimulate new perspectives, innovation, and exchange of information and resources for autoimmune disease research.
Collaboration across all phases of research will incorporate diﬀerent perspectives, resources, and expertise to drive high-
priority scientiﬁc advances.

NIH-WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH, FISCAL YEARS 2026–2030


IMPLEMENTATION VISION:

COORDINATING COMMITTEE FOR AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE RESEARCH

Coordinating Committee for Autoimmune Disease Research

The Coordinating Committee for Autoimmune Disease Research (CCADR) is an internal National Institutes of Health (NIH)
committee convened in support of autoimmune disease research at NIH. CCADR members include NIH Institute, Center,
and Oﬃce (ICO) representatives nominated by ICO Directors, the Oﬃce of Autoimmune Disease Research in the Oﬃce of
Research  on  Women’s  Health  (OADR-ORWH)  and  ORWH  leadership,  and  program  management  staﬀ.  Together  these
individuals bring broad subject matter expertise and experience in autoimmune disease research, priorities, and policy.
Members discuss programmatic, scientiﬁc, and operational focus areas as well as action plans to leverage ongoing NIH
investments in autoimmune disease research.

Strategic Plan Working Group

The  Strategic  Plan  Working  Group  (SPWG)  is  an  internal  NIH-wide  working  group  created  under  CCADR.  With
representation from 21 out of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs), the SPWG provides subject matter expertise in immunology
and autoimmune disease research as well as NIH operations and strategic planning. The SPWG drove the development of
the inaugural NIH-Wide Strategic Plan for Autoimmune Disease Research, evaluating and integrating numerous sources of
data to identify gaps, opportunities, and high-priority research areas to create the framework to advance autoimmune
disease research across NIH. The SPWG was organized in September 2023, met monthly through July 2025, and continues
to meet as needed. OADR-ORWH coordinates the SPWG and related activities. In the CCADR member list, SPWG Members
are denoted with an asterisk (*) and SPWG Co-Chairs are denoted with a double asterisk (**).
