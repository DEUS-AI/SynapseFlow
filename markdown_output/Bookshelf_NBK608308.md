 Introduction

Autoimmune diseases (ADs) are a heterogeneous
group of diseases affecting 8–10% of the Western
population,  which  constitute  a  heavy  burden  to
society  and  are  often  debilitating  and  disabling
for  affected  individuals. ADs  are  defined  as  an
impairment  of  the  immune  system  resulting  in
the loss of immune tolerance against self-tissues,
by the existence of autoreactive T and B cells and
by a complex mechanism of multifactorial aetiol-

ogy,  across  genetics  and  environmental  factors
(Alexander  and  Greco  2022).  Autoimmunity  is
also linked to autoinflammation, having common
features as the activation against self, with subse-
quent systemic inflammation (Chap. 93).

Current  therapeutic  strategies  for  AD  are
based  on  systemic  immunosuppression  (IS)  or
targeted  biologic  disease-modifying  therapies
(DMTs),  which  ameliorate  symptoms  and  halt
progression  in  the  vast  majority  of  patients  but
usually  require  continuous  administration  and

may  be  associated  with  long-term  side  effects
and  substantial  costs.  Although  biologic  DMT
has improved specificity and efficacy in the treat-
ment landscape, cure remains elusive, and many
patients  still  suffer  from  progressive  disability
with shortened life expectancy and comorbidity.
Initially supported by preclinical animal mod-
els  and  ‘serendipitous’  case  reports,  auto-HCT
has grown as a promising and feasible treatment
option  for  severe  treatment-resistant  patients,
especially  in  diseases  for  which  effective  thera-
pies are lacking. The annual number of patients
treated  with  autologous  HCT  is  constantly
increasing (Alexander and Greco 2022), and AD
are  among  the  fastest  growing  disease  category
reported  to  the  EBMT  for  autologous  HCT
(Passweg  et  al.  2021). Allo-HCT  has  also  been
undertaken, although caution related to its intrin-
sic risks has precluded widespread application.

The  EBMT  Autoimmune  Diseases  Working
Party (ADWP) was established in 1997 by Alois
Gratwohl,  Alberto  Marmont,  Alan  Tyndall  and
Athanasios  Fassas,  who  developed  the  registry
covering  AD  indications  and  produced  early
guidelines based on consensus opinion (Tyndall
and Gratwohl 1997).

Subsequently,  the  ADWP  built  productively
on these initial achievements, generating studies
from  the  growing  registry  and  developing  rela-
tionships  with  other  specialist  societies,  culmi-
nating  with  successful  publication  of  three
randomised  controlled  trials  (van  Laar  et  al.
2014; Hawkey et al. 2015; Mancardi et al. 2015),
along  with  updated  guidelines  for  clinical  prac-
tice (Snowden et al. 2012), immune monitoring
and biobanking (Alexander et al. 2015; Cencioni
et al. 2022).

With increasing evidence, the guidelines have
become more disease specific. A successful inter-


involving  also  non-
national  collaboration
European  experts
the  EBMT
resulted
guidelines  for  auto-HCT  in  systemic  sclerosis
(Farge  et  al.  2017b).  A  further  collaborative
review  with  the  European  Crohn’s  and  Colitis
Organisation (ECCO) has included recommenda-
tions  for  patient  selection,  transplant  technique
and  follow-up  of  HCT  in  patients  with  Crohn’s
disease (Snowden et al. 2018). EBMT guidelines
for  MS  and  other  neurological  diseases  were
published  in  2020  (Sharrack  et  al.  2020).
Guidelines for best practices were also provided
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  (Greco  et  al.
2021, 2023).

The  current  state  of  the  EBMT  database  in
relation to various ADs is summarised in Tables
92.1 and 92.2. At the time of writing, over 4000
patients  receiving  HCT  for  an  AD  have  been
reported  to  the  EBMT,  the  largest  international
database, with activity reported to other registries
adding substantially to the worldwide numbers.

Based  on  this  reported  activity,  this  chapter
will cover the main neurological, rheumatologi-
cal and gastroenterological indications for auto-
HCT,  along  with  reference  to  the  rare  AD
indications  and  allogeneic  HCT.  More  detailed
literature can be sourced from recently published
reviews (Achini‐Gutzwiller et al. 2022; Alexander
and Greco 2022; Snowden et al. 2017).

 Mechanisms of Action

HCT represented an opportunity to gain insights
into the aetiology and pathogenesis of AD, char-
acterised  by  aberrant  activation  of  the  immune
system with failure of the immune regulation to
maintain adapted tolerance. HCT exerts its thera-
peutic  effect
through  various  mechanisms,
including  the  immunosuppressive  conditioning
regimen able to eradicate the autoreactive immu-
nologic  memory,  and  the  regeneration  and
renewal of the immune system, leading to the re-
induction of immune tolerance to rewire aberrant
immune response toward self-antigens (Cencioni
et al. 2022; Lima-Junior et al. 2021). The effect
of  HCT  on  immunologic  renewal  has  been  the
focus of many mechanistic studies. They collec-
tively  demonstrated  that  many  of  the  age-  or
immune  disturbances
autoimmune-mediated
may  improve  or  even  resolve.  For  example,
immune  reconstitution  studies  indicated  a  pre-
dominant  repopulation  of  CD27-IgD+  naïve  B
cells (Alexander et al. 2009; Arruda et al. 2018),
a stable output of recent thymic emigrants (RTE)
(Farge et al. 2017a; Muraro et al. 2005), leading
to a re-diversification of the receptor repertoire,

and recurrence of both regulatory B and T cells in
various  disease  settings  (Alexander  et  al.  2013;
Lima-Junior et al. 2021). Allo-HCT has been less
well  explored,  although  there  is  an  element  of
immune  replacement  and  evidence  for  a  ‘graft-
versus- autoimmune  effect’  (Greco  et  al.  2019).
Further, areas for exploration include the impact
of  the  microbiome  on  autoimmunity  and  the
impact of HCT (Alexander et al. 2021).

92.3

 HCT for Multiple
Sclerosis (MS)

Since the first case report of using auto-HCT as a
treatment for MS was published in 1995 (Fassas
et al. 1997), the EBMT registry has now accumu-
lated over 2000 patients (Table 92.2). This treat-
ment was initially used in patients with advanced
and progressive disease as a rescue therapy with
limited efficacy. More recently, its use in patients
with  active  relapsing  MS  has  been  associated
with prolonged clinical and MRI responses and,
in  some  cases,  significant  improvement  in  dis-
ability  to  a  degree  rarely  seen  with  disease-
modifying therapies (DMT) (Muraro et al. 2017b;

828

T. Alexander et al.

Tolf et al. 2019). The bulk of the data has been
provided  by  observational  cohort  studies  in
which  patients  failing  to  respond  to  standard
DMT  were  treated  with  an  auto-HCT.  Burman
et  al.  identified  the  four  most  rigorously  con-
ducted  cohort  studies  in  which  a  total  of  188
relapsing  MS  patients
received  auto-HCT
(Burman et al. 2018). In these studies, PFS was
observed in 70–91% of patients at 5 years (where
progression  is  defined  as  a  deterioration  of  at
least 0.5–1 points from baseline in the Expanded
Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Furthermore, no
evidence of disease activity (NEDA), defined as
the  absence  of  clinical  relapses,  disability  pro-
gression and MRI disease activity, was observed
in  70–92%  of  patients  at  2  years  post-
transplantation (Boffa et al. 2021; Muraro et al.
2017a). Such results were compared with DMT
efficacy  data  reported  in  registration  studies
(Muraro  et  al.  2017a).  Higher  rates  of  NEDA
were  achieved  with  auto-HCT  than  with  any
other  DMT,  including  those  that  are  considered
to  have  high  efficacy,  although  these  studies
included different patient populations. Only two
randomised
trials  of  auto-HCT  have  been
reported in the literature. The first was a phase II
trial which showed auto-HCT to be more effec-
tive  than  mitoxantrone  on  MRI  disease  activity
(Mancardi et al. 2015). The second was a phase
III randomised controlled trial which showed that
auto-HCT resulted in prolonged time to disability
progression compared to DMTs. Improvement in
the EDSS score (3.4–2.4 vs 3.31–3.98), reduction
in  relapse  rate  (1  vs  39)  and  reduced  disability
progression (6% vs 60%) were seen in the aHCT
group  vs  controls,  respectively.  There  were  no
significant  side  effects  and  no  treatment  related
mortality  in  the  aHCT  arm  (Burt  et  al.  2019).
Three  phase  III  randomised  controlled  trials,
aimed  to  compare  auto-HCT  to  DMTs  are  cur-

started  (Sharrack  et  al.  2022). The  conditioning
regimens  used  in  MS  vary  between  treatment
centres.  The  balance  of  efficacy  and  acceptable
safety  profile  of  ‘intermediate  intensity’  regi-

recruiting

mens,  i.e.  either  the  specific  ‘BEAM  +  ATG’
regimen  or  the  more  generic  regimen  of  CY
200 mg/kg combined with ATG, led to their rec-
ommended  use  in  the  current  EBMT  ADWP
guidelines  (Sharrack  et  al.  2020).  Single-centre
data  suggest
that  ‘high-intensity’  regimens,
incorporating Busulfan and ex-vivo T-cell deple-
tion,  have  higher  rates  of  PFS  but  potentially
greater  toxicity,  including  TRM  (Atkins  et  al.
2016).  Retrospective  registry  data  suggest  that
graft  purging  has  no  added  benefit  to  the  trans-
plant outcome (Sharrack et al. 2020).

Currently,  auto-HCT  is  recommended  as  a
standard of care for patients with active relapsing
MS failing DMTs and as a treatment option for
patients  with  progressive  MS  with  evidence  of
disease activity or patients with aggressive MS as
a first-line treatment. The best results are seen in
patients  who  are  not  older  than  45  years,  have
had the illness for less than 10 years, are not very
disabled (EDSS ≤6) and have active disease with
evidence  of  enhancement  on  their  MRI.  The
ADWP has recently provided guidelines for the
management of HCT in MS and other immune-
mediated  neurological  ADs  (Sharrack  et  al.
2020), and current clinical trials are summarised
in a recent review (Sharrack et al. 2022). Updated
interspecialty guidelines have been finalised fol-
lowing  a
joint  EBMT-ECTRIMS  workshop
(Muraro et al. unpublished).

 HCT for Systemic Sclerosis
(SSc)

Over  the  past  25  years,  results  from  large
European  prospective  observational  studies  and
analysis of the European Scleroderma Trials and
Research  Group  (EUSTAR)  registry  data  base
(Elhai  et  al.  2017)  confirmed  that  SSc  patients
benefit only marginally from standard immuno-
suppressive drugs, including CY, with a progres-
sive
in  SSc-specific  mortality,
predominantly related to cardiac (31%) and pul-
monary  causes  (18%).  Since  three  successive
randomised  trials,  namely,  ASSIST  [American

[Scleroderma:

Cyclophosphamide Or Transplantation, (Sullivan
et  al.  2018)],  have  now  demonstrated  that  auto-
HCT is superior to CY for early rapidly progres-
sive SSc in terms of long-term survival as well as
improvement of lung function and skin fibrosis,
AHCT for early severe dcSSc patients is now rec-
ommended with a grade I level of evidence by the
EBMT  (Snowden  et  al.  2022),  and  by  the
American  Rheumatism  Association  (ACR)  and
The  European  League  Against  Rheumatism
(Kowal-Bielecka  et  al.  2017)  and  the American
Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy
(Majhail  et  al.  2015),  with  increased  transplant
activity reported to the EBMT registry and world-
wide over the last decade.

Of  note, ASSIST  and ASTIS  utilised  a  non-
myeloablative  regimen  of  cyclophosphamide
(200 mg/kg total dose) and rabbit antithymocyte
globulin (rATG), and the main difference between
the two studies was that ASSIST mobilised stem
cells with 2 g/m2 CY and infused unmanipulated
peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), while ASTIS
mobilised stem cells with 4 g/m2 CY and infused
CD34+ selected PBSC. The SCOT trial used no
CY  with  only  G-CSF  for  mobilisation  and  a
lower dose of CY (120 mg/kg total dose) for con-
ditioning  plus  TBI  (800  cGy/4  fractions  over
2 days/200 cGy to lungs and kidneys with shield-
ing), which induces myeloablation.

In  addition,  patient  selection  was  shown  to
directly affect transplant outcomes (Henes et al.
2021) with specific concern for cardiac involve-
ment,  undetected  by  echocardiography  alone,
becoming  clinically  overt  during  the  transplant
procedure, under the stress of fluid overload, CY
and  ATG  administration  and  sepsis.  Current

patients,  according  to  the  2013  ACR/EULAR
classification  criteria  (van  den  Hoogen  et  al.
2013), aged 18–65 years (certain paediatric indi-
cations  may  be  considered  on  a  case-by-case
basis), with disease duration less than 2 years and
a  clinical  phenotype  of  diffuse  SSc,  a  modified
Rodnan  score  (mRSS)  greater  than  20,  a  sedi-
mentation rate >25 mm or an elevated C-reactive

protein >5 mg/L or a haemoglobin level less than
11  g/dL  not  explained  by  causes  other  than  the
evolvability of SSc; or less than 5 years SSc with
a) a modified Rodnan skin score ≥15 plus severe
organ involvement in respiratory, cardiovascular
or renal systems or b) a mRSS <14 (limited skin
involvement),  in  case  of  coexisting  severe  pro-
gressive  lung  involvement  (alteration  of  FVC
and/or  TLC  ≥10%  and/or  DLCO  ≥15%  com-
pared to an initial value obtained 12 ± 6 months
previously).  Treatment  should  be  performed  in
JACIE-accredited  centres  where  combined
expertise from SSc disease specialists and dedi-
cated  transplant  teams  can  assess  and  follow
patients  before,  during  and  after  the  procedure
according  to  Good  Clinical  Practices  (Snowden
et  al.  2017).  Since  toxicity  and  efficacy  arise
from individual patient selection and the condi-
tioning  regimen,  different  chemotherapies  may
account for subtle differences in results, and fur-
ther  studies  are  warranted  to  analyse  the  use  of
attenuated  conditioning  regimens  according  to
cardiac  function  and  risk  for  renal  crises  (Burt
et al. 2021).

92.5

 HCT for Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus (SLE)

Despite the era of DMTs, a considerable number
of  patients  with  SLE  do  not  achieve  clinical
remission,  with  an  accumulating  risk  of  organ
failure and increased mortality. For these patients,
autologous  HCT  has  been  applied  since  1996
with  more  than  300  cases  reported  worldwide
(Alexander  and  Greco  2022).  The  two  largest
experiences on auto-HCT for SLE come from the
EBMT  data  registry  (n  =  53;  mean  follow-up,
25  months)  and  from  a  single-centre  trial  per-
formed at the Northwestern University (n = 50;
mean follow-up, 29 months), both demonstrating
a probability of 5-year DFS of 50% despite dis-
continuation  of  chronic
immunosuppression.
Subsequently, a follow-up study from the EBMT
registry  reported  the  outcome  of  auto-HCT  in
SLE  with  various  regimens  between  2001  and
2008  (n  =  28;  median  follow-up,  38  months;
range,  1–110  months)  (Alchi  et  al.  2013).

830

T. Alexander et al.

Although  PFS  in  this  study  was  only  29%  at
5 years, TRM had gradually improved. In addi-
tion,  this  study  indicated  that  CD34-selection
was associated with a significantly reduced risk
for relapse. More recently, Richard Burt reported
a remission rate of 92% at 1 year, 81% at 2 years,
71% at 3 years, and 62% at 4 and 5 years post-
HCT,  respectively,  for  26  patients  receiving  a
CYC/ATG/RTX conditioning (Burt et al. 2018).
Long-term outcomes (Burt et al. 2021) are avail-
able from two independent Chinese reports, both
with  10-year  follow-up,  demonstrating  remark-
able  clinical  responses  with  PFS  of  86%  and
68%, respectively, while TRM across both stud-
ies was only 2%.

Summarising  the  results  from  the  most  rele-
vant 15 studies in the field covering 339 patients
with a median follow-up of 5 years, the median
remission rate achieved was 65% with a median
mortality of 8%, with a gradual decline of TRM
from  12%  in  the  first  EBMT  registry  survey  in
2004 to <5% in most recent reports between 2017
and 2019 (Burt et al. 2021). Overall, responding
patients are usually free of clinical symptoms and
may  regain  seronegativity  for  antinuclear  anti-
bodies, which is rarely seen under conventional
therapies. Early use of HCT also has the potential
to  protect  against  organ  failure  and  toxicity-
related  morbidity  and  improve  quality  of  life
(Burt  et  al.  2018). The  relapse  rate  is  higher  in
patients receiving unmanipulated stem cell grafts
and  conditioning  regimens  without  serotherapy
(Alchi et al. 2013). Current evidence and expert
consensus  suggest  HCT  in  SLE  as  ‘clinical
option’  in  patients  with  active  disease  (BILAG
category  A),  state  despite  chronic  immunosup-
pression  with  or  without  B-cell-targeted  thera-
pies (Illei et al. 2011; Snowden et al. 2012, 2022).

92.6

 HCT for Crohn’s Disease (CD)

Despite  the  major  recent  progress  in  the  treat-
ment  of  CD,  based  around  corticosteroids,  IS
(thiopurines,  MTX)  and  DMTs  (Ab  targeting
TNFα,  α4β7  integrin  or  IL-12/IL-23),  some
patients  fail  all  available  therapies.  In  many

cases, surgery may be an option but may lead to
short bowel syndrome or to a permanent stoma,
which may be unacceptable to patients. With this
background, in the past few years, auto-HCT has
emerged  as  a  promising  therapy  in  a  subset  of
patients in whom the disease is refractory to all
available therapies, with progressive tissue dam-
age and potentially reduced life expectancy.

Auto-HCT  has  been  investigated  in  several
studies  with  encouraging  responses,  some  pro-
longed,  although  a  progressive  incidence  of
relapse  with  long-term  follow-up  is  recognised
(Burt  et  al.  2010;  Lopez-Garcia  et  al.  2017).
Furthermore,  patients  regain  response  to  anti-
TNF therapy, although they had been refractory
to this drug class prior to HCT.

In Europe, the EBMT-sponsored ASTIC trial
in  patients  with  refractory  CD  produced  appar-
ently negative results as few patients after auto-
the  stringent  primary  composite
HCT  met
endpoint  of  clinical  remission  for  3  months
(Hawkey et al. 2015). However, it should not be
assumed that this single trial provides the defini-
tive answer to the benefit of auto-HCT in CD, as
the number of patients included was limited and
encouraging long-term follow-up of ASTIC trial
patients  has  since  been  reported  (Lindsay  et  al.
2017).  Encouraging  results  have  also  been
reported  by  an  EBMT  retrospective  analysis  of
82  treatment-resistant  patients  who  were  not  in
the ASTIC trial. In this difficult-to-treat group of
patients,  around  a  quarter  maintained  remission
without  further  medical  therapy,  and  long-term
disease control was maintained with the reintro-
duction  of  salvage  therapies  in  the  majority  of
patients  who  relapsed.  TRM  occurred  in  one
patient (Brierley et al. 2018).

The  EBMT  ADWP  and  ECCO  (European
Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation) have published
a joint position paper of auto-HCT in CD, which
recommends auto-HCT ideally in the context of a
multicentre  clinical  trial  but  on  an  individual
basis  may  currently  be  considered  for  patients
with  active  CD  refractory  to  IS  and  biological
treatments or unacceptable risks of surgical man-
agement  (Snowden  et  al.  2018).  These  recom-
mendations include conditioning regimens using

92  Autoimmune Disease

831

CY/ATG, which has been used in the majority of
HCT for CD with an acceptable and predictable
balance  between  safety  and  efficacy  in  these
challenging CD cases. A cautionary note should
be  taken  from  a  recent  randomised  controlled
trial using FLU, CY and ATG-based conditioning
regimens, which was stopped early due to unex-
pected  severe  toxicity,  including  thrombotic
microangiopathy (Lindsay 2021).

The next steps in this field focus on minimis-
ing  the  risk  of  infectious  complications  in  this
setting. In this sense, CY-free mobilisation seems
to  be  safe  and  effective  (Giordano  et  al.  2022)
and  other  modifications  will  be  key  to  further
development  and  deliverability  of  autologous
HCT  in  patients  with  severe  CD  refractory  to
modern DMTs.

for Autoimmune Diseases

Autoimmune  diseases  have  also  been  treated
with allo-HCT from MRD, URD and CB sources.
In the last 25 years, the EBMT registry has col-
lated 286 cases. Because of the higher procedural
risks and potential long-term impact on quality of
life from late effects, allo-HCT has been largely
restricted  to  life-threatening  AD  in  paediatric
practice  with  the  most  common  indications  in
immune  cytopenia  followed  by  arthritis.  In  a
recent summary of cases from the registry (Greco
et  al.  2019),  128  patients  undergoing  allo-HCT
were treated between 1997 and 2014. The median
age  was  12.7  years  (range  0.2–62.2).  The  inci-
dence  of  grades  II–IV  aGvHD  was  20.8%  at
100  days.  The  cumulative  incidence  of  cGvHD
was  27.8%  at  5  years.  Non-relapse  mortality
(NRM) was 12.7% at 100 days. OS and PFS were
70.2 and 59.4% at 5 years, respectively. By mul-
tivariate analysis, age <18 years, males and more
recent year of transplant were found to be signifi-
cantly  associated  with  improved  PFS.  Reduced
conditioning  intensity  was  associated  with  a
lower  NRM.  In  a  subgroup  of  64  patients  with
detailed information, a complete clinical response
was obtained in 67% of patients at 1 year.

Moreover, allo-HCT may represent a potential
treatment  option  for  the  novel  entity  called
VEXAS
(Vacuoles,  E1  enzyme,  X-linked,
Autoinflammatory, Somatic) (Bruno et al. 2023).
In  summary,  experience  in  allo-HCT  is  lim-
ited,  but  long-term  data  are  supportive  of  basic
biological differences in the responses of AD to
allo-  and  auto-HCT  in  terms  of  curability.
However, due to related NRM risks, the applica-
tion of allo-HCT remained limited and develop-
mental  in AD.  With  time,  allo-HCT  in AD  has
become safer and activity continues, particularly
in  the  paediatric  field.  Moreover,  improved
patient  selection,  reduced  toxicity  conditioning
regimens and new strategies for GvHD prophy-
laxis (i.e. PT-CY) are currently under investiga-
tion,  generating
the
interest
application to non-malignant disorders. In addi-
tion,  there  has  been  increasing  recognition  that
the nature of the genetic component of some AD
means that allo-HCT is the only realistic approach
for  long-term  disease  control.  Thus,  there  is
renewed interest in this area, particularly where
there  is  overlap  with  autoinflammatory  and
immunodeficiency  diseases,  particularly  in  the
paediatric  setting  as  summarised  in  a  recent
EBMT review (Achini‐Gutzwiller et al. 2022).

 Other Indications

A  variety  of  other  ADs  have  been  treated
(Table 92.2). Haematological immune cytopenias
have  been  treated  with  a  mixture  of  auto-HCT
and  allo-HCT.  Type  1  diabetes  in  early  ‘honey-
moon’ phase has been the subject of clinical tri-
als, with some ability to prevent or reduce insulin
requirements.  Otherwise,  there  is  a  mixture  of
rarer  neurological,  rheumatological  and  gastro-
enterological indications for which the registry is
essential  for  developing  an  evidence  base.
Cautious recommendations for these rare indica-
tions  are  provided  in  the  EBMT ADWP  guide-
lines  (Snowden  et  al.  2012;  Greco  et  al.  2021)
and  recently  updated  EBMT  recommendations
on  haematopoietic  cellular  therapy  indications
(Snowden et al. 2022).

 Conclusions and Future
Directions

With  accumulating  evidence  and  improved  out-
comes,  along  with  the  recognition  that  modern
biological and other therapies are not universally
effective, ADs have become the fastest-growing
indication for HCT (Alexander and Greco 2022;
Passweg et al. 2021). Initially applied as salvage
therapy in patients with poor prognosis, HCT has
emerged as a promising treatment option for AD
patients earlier in the treatment algorithm. This is
the  result  of  successful  large  phase  II  and  ran-
domised  controlled  phase  III  trials  and  updated
guidelines  for  patient  selection  and  transplant
techniques  in  SSc,  MS  and  CD,  respectively
(Farge et al. 2017b; Sharrack et al. 2020; Snowden
et al. 2012).

In 2023, the major indications for HCT in AD
are MS, SSc and CD (Alexander and Greco 2022)
for  which  significant  subsets  of  patients  still
show an unsatisfactory response to both conven-
tional and targeted biologic therapies.

Moving forward, further efforts are needed to
drive HCT into routine clinical care. It is recom-
mended that patients should be treated in experi-
enced and JACIE-accredited transplant centres in
a  multidisciplinary  setting.  A  future  goal  is  to
optimise the conditioning regimens according to
disease-specific  requirements  and  to  outbalance
the  intensity  to  maintain  outcomes  while  mini-
mising  toxicity  and  TRM  risk.  Moreover,  posi-
tive  preliminary  experiences  have  been  recently
reported with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR)
T cells, paving the way for the use of innovative
cell therapy approaches in AD field (Chap. 93).

In  addition,  comprehensive  data  reporting,
harmonisation  and  exploitation  of  existing  bio-
banking  infrastructure  (Alexander  et  al.  2015),
education at individual centre and network level,
including  ADWP  educational  activities  (Burt
et  al.  2021)  and  health  economic  evaluations
along  with  evidence-based  recommendations
will establish the future place of HCT in the treat-
ment  algorithms  for  various  autoimmune  and
inflammatory diseases.

Key Points
•  With  accumulating  evidence,  including
randomised  controlled  trials,  AD  has
become one of the fastest-growing indi-
cation for autologous HCT.

•  Major  indications  for  HCT  in  AD
include multiple sclerosis (MS) and sys-
temic sclerosis (SSc), where auto-HCT
treatment
algorithms.

featuring

now


•  Although  HCT  for  ADs  is  predomi-
nantly  autologous,  there  is  renewed
interest in allo-HCT, particularly in ADs
with autoinflammatory and immunode-
ficiency components.

•  It  is  recommended  that  all  patients
should  be  treated  in  experienced  and
JACIE-accredited
transplant  centres
with  close  multidisciplinary  collabora-
tion and reporting of data to the EBMT
registry.

•  Immune  reconstitution  studies  are  pro-
viding  insights  into  the  mechanisms  of
immune  reset  following  HCT  and  dis-
ease processes underlying various AD.
