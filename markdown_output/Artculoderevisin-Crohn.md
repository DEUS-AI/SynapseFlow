La  incidencia  y  la  prevalencia  de  la  enfermedad  de  Crohn  (EC)  han
aumentado en todo el mundo. La carga económica y el impacto en la
calidad de vida de los pacientes nos obligan a realizar un diagnóstico
precoz, para así inducir y mantener la remisión, previniendo las com-
plicaciones a largo plazo. Se ha descrito un gradiente Norte-Sur de la
prevalencia de la EC; sin embargo, existen pocos reportes acerca de
la epidemiología de esta entidad en los países latinoamericanos,
por  lo  tanto, la prevalencia real y el desarrollo de la enfermedad en
nuestra población se desconocen. Durante los últimos años, expertos
han hecho importantes avances en el diagnóstico y manejo de la EC;
no obstante, actualmente, no contamos con un tratamiento curativo. El
conocimiento  reciente  de  las  terapias  inmunomoduladoras  y  biológi-
cas ha establecido nuevas metas para la inducción y mantenimiento
de la remisión en la enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal. En este artícu-
lo  revisamos  los  aspectos  epidemiológicos  y  clínicos  más  actuales,
enfocándonos en la evaluación del paciente; asimismo, hacemos un
breve repaso del tratamiento de la EC.

The  incidence  and  prevalence  of  Crohn’s  disease  (CD)  is  increa-
sing  worldwide.  The  economic  burden  and  impact  on  patients’
quality of life, make an early diagnosis of Crohn’s disease, a priority
to induce and maintain remission and prevent long-term complica-
tions. It has been described a North to South gradient of prevalence,
however, there are only a few reports about the epidemiology of this
disease  in  Latin-American  countries,  therefore  the  real  prevalence
and behavior of the disease in our population is unknown. During
the last years, experts have made important advances in the diag-
nosis and treatment of the disease. However, despite this advances,
currently, there is no curative treatment for CD. Recent knowledge
of  immunomodulatory  and  biologic  therapies  in  the  treatment  of
inflammatory  bowel  diseases  (IBD)  has  established  new  goals  in
the induction and maintenance of remission of these diseases. This
article  reviews  current  knowledge  of  epidemiological  and  clinical
aspects,  an  approach  in  the  evaluation  of  the  patient  and  a  brief
review on treatment of Crohn’s disease.

INTRODUCTION

Crohn’s Disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are
the  two  main  presentations  of  inflammatory  bowel
diseases (IBD). Crohn’s disease is characterized by the
involvement of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to
anus, with a transmural pattern of inflammation of gas-
trointestinal  wall  layers.  The  incidence  of  CD  in  Latin
America  is  low;  however,  a  rising  incidence  has  been
reported in the past 50 years in western countries. The
origin of the disease is not entirely clear however several

involved  mechanisms  have  been  postulated  such  as
genetic predisposition and disruption of homeostasis
regulation in the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical manifes-
tations are numerous and the vast majority are secondary to
the inflammatory process that damages intestinal muco-
sa and deeper layers, causing loss of surface absorption,
wall thickening, obstruction or fistulation. Differential diag-
nosis includes intestinal tuberculosis and malignancies.
In cases where there is a strong suspicion, special image
techniques, and serum and fecal biomarkers must be per-
formed.  Currently,  there  is  no  definitive  treatment  for

CD; however, the development of biological therapies
has allowed the approach of new therapeutic targets,
which ameliorate symptoms, delay progression of com-
plications and improve quality of life. This review focu-
ses on current knowledge on Crohn’s Disease.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

We used the terms “inflammatory bowel disease” and
“Crohn’s disease” to search the EMBASE and MEDLINE,
OVID and HINARI databases for publications that inclu-
ded meta-analyses, systematic reviews, clinical trials and
review articles.

General aspects of Crohn’s disease (CD)

Definition

UC and CD are the two main types of inflammatory
bowel diseases. UC affects only colon mucosal layer with
continuous ascending pattern, while CD is characterized
for affecting the entire gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth
to  the  anus  with  a  transmural  affection,  mainly  with  a
patchy pattern (Table 1).1,2 Up to 10-15% of patients with
IBD cannot be classified in none of these types, therefore
pathologists described the term of “indeterminate colitis”
(IC) for colectomy specimens in which no specific features
of CD or UC were seen.3

Recent evidence suggests that an inflammatory pro-
cess which involves pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
TNF-α and a wide variety of interleukins, damages the

layers of the gastrointestinal tract in patches, leaving some
undamaged segments of mucosa (Figure 1).

Epidemiology

A  “North  to  South  gradient”  of  incidence  has  been
suggested previously in several publications. North Ameri-
ca (7 to 10.3/100, 00 per year), United Kingdom (8.3 to
9.1/100,000  per  year)  and  Northern  Europe  (5.8-6.3/
100,000 per year) have the highest incidence of CD; simi-
lar behavior has been seen in prevalence: 207/100,000
per year in North America, 156/100,000 per year in the
United Kingdom and 90/100,000 per year in Northern
Europe.4-9

However,  this  gradient  is  not  widely  accepted  since

the lack of information of IBD in southern countries.

Regarding epidemiology in Latin America, there are
only a few reports about the incidence and prevalence
of this disease. Although the incidence of CD in South
America  has  been  reported  to  be  lower  compared  to
North America, in the last 50 years, occidental countries
have reported a rising in both, incidence and prevalence,
of  IBD.10  The  lowest  incidence  has  been  reported  in
Puerto Rico.11 In Mexico a study carried out by Yamamo-
to-Furusho, showed an increased incidence of ulcerative
colitis from 1987 to 2006, with a 2.6-fold increase from
1997 to 2006, compared to the previous decade, su-
ggesting this increase being caused by the environmental
factors and the unique genetic mosaic of the Mexican
population.12 However, there is no information regarding
CD in Mexico.

especially in Paneth cells, which are responsible for de-
fense against enteric pathogens. Three genetic variants
within the gene CARD15 / NOD2 are present in up to
30% of Caucasian patients with CD (A702W, G908R and
L1007fsinsC). For homozygotes and compound hetero-
zygotes,  the  risk  of  developing  CD  is  10  to  42  times
higher compared to individuals without the mutation.
Moreover, the variants mentioned are associated with
an increased frequency of ileal disease, stenosis and
earlier onset.16

Smoking typically has been thought as a risk factor for
CD, but a protector factor in UC. In some studies, cigaret-
te smoking has been associated with exacerbations and it
is believed to be a risk factor for having IBD, although it is
controversial.17

Appendectomy demonstrates a divergent influence on
IBD. In a meta-analysis published in 2008, they found that
appendectomy increased the risk for the development of
CD.18 However, the risk for CD decreased, while patients
were operated before 10 years of age. Andersson, et al.
found that appendectomy due to perforating appendicitis
may increase the risk for subsequent intestinal resection,
while appendectomy due to other reasons reduced the
risk for CD.19 The relationship between appendectomy and
CD is still not conclusive.

Pathophysiology

It is known that there are genetic factors (gene CARD
25/NOD2 mutations and polymorphisms of TLR) and en-
vironmental factors (smoking, drugs, social status, stress,
microorganisms, diet, appendectomy and intestinal per-
meability) that participate in the physiopathology of this
disease. The most accepted theory suggests that intesti-
nal inflammation is produced by an abnormal response
from the lymphocytes T against enteric bacterial flora in
genetic susceptible people.16

In CD overexpression of toll-like receptors (TLR) could
induce an alteration in the recognition and discrimination
of their own bacterial flora, resulting in activation of cyto-
kines such as NF-κB. Such alteration of the innate immu-
nity leads to an uncontrolled activation of lymphocytes T
helper, especially Th1 response, and the release of pro-
inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, culminating in tis-
sue destruction.

Finally, there is an exaggerated production of antibo-
dies  (ASCA),  and  both  regulatory  lymphocytes  T  and
lymphocyte apoptosis are altered, thereby limiting anti-
inflammatory mechanisms.2,20

vasculature  (comb  sing).

A recent retrospective observational study in United
States compared the incidence of IBD in Caucasian and
Hispanic population, where Hispanics represented 60% of
the population of study. In this study, the authors obser-
ved that the diagnosis of UC is more frequent than CD in
Hispanic population. However, the diagnosis of IBD is done
at a more advanced age in Hispanic population, this may
be caused by delay in seek of health attention or more
frequent extra-intestinal manifestations. In Hispanic pa-
tients there is a lower number of intestinal resection due
to IBD.13

Etiology and risk factors

Although the etiology is not completely understood,
multiple mechanisms have been described. Genetic pre-
disposition and disruption of the intestinal homeostasis are
two of the most studied etiological factors.14

CD affects predominantly females, with an incidence

peak around the second and third decades of life.10,15

Previous studies have described that CD is more pre-
valent in Ashkenazi Jewish, and it has been associated
with multiple genetic variants such as Nucleotide-
binding Oligomerization Domain containing 2 (NOD2),
which is the first susceptibility gene strongly associated.
This  gene  is  expressed  in  the  intestinal  epithelium,

Clinical manifestations

There are a vast number of clinical manifestations, in-
cluding abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomit, fever
and  weight  loss,  among  other  manifestations.20,21  It  is
believed they are mainly due to the inflammatory process
in the gastrointestinal tract which causes alteration of the
intestinal mucosa, decreasing the absorption of micronu-
trients.22-24

It is important to have in mind the intestinal complica-
tions which include low intestinal bleeding, perforation,
intraabdominal abscesses, stenosis and intestinal obstruc-
tion. The presence of anal fistulas is highly suggestive of
CD25 (Table 2).

Extra-intestinal manifestations occur in 30% of the
patients and affect organs apart from the gut, such as the
joints (peripheral arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroilii-
tis), skin (pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum),
eyes  (uveitis,  episcleritis)  and  hepatobiliary  system
(primary sclerosing cholangitis) (Table 3). EIMs are most
common when the colon (as opposed to the small bowel)
is  inflamed.  Some  EIMs  appear  directly  related  to  the
activity of the bowel disease and others appear to follow a
distinct course.26 Anemia and arthropathy are the most
common  EIMS.  Anemia  of  IBD  is  a  unique  model
characterized by overlap of chronic disease anemia and
iron deficiency anemia with other causes of anemia, such
as vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency and effects of
medications.27

On  the  other  side,  arthropathy  can  have  peripheral
(pauciarticular and polyarticular arthritis) or axial (spon-
dylitis and sacroilitis) articular involvement, and may pre-
cede, be synchronous with, or develop following the diag-
nosis of CD. Peripheral arthritis classically is seronegative,
non-deforming, non-erosive, involves large joints and is

asymmetric. Type 1 peripheral arthritis is pauciarticular
(knees, ankles, hips, wrists, elbows and shoulders), invol-
ving fewer than 5 joints, and is strongly associated with
disease activity and other EIMs. Type 2 peripheral arthritis
is polyarticular (metacarpophalangeal joint, proximal in-
terphalangeal  joint,  metatarsophalangeal  joint,  knees,
ankles, and shoulders), independent of disease activity,
and not usually associated with other EIMS. Axial involve-
ment is independent of gut pathology.28

Although primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is the most
common hepatobiliary disorder associated with IBD, it is
more common in UC than in CD, however, gallstones
(incidence  from  13-14%),  medication-associated  liver
disease and fatty liver seem to be higher in patients with
CD compared with patients with UC and general population.29
Some other important manifestations are failure to thrive,
renal  lithiasis,  and  osteoporosis,  all  these  related  to
malabsorption.30,31

Diagnosis and classification

In  our  media,  owing  to  the  fact  that  CD  has  a  low
prevalence, CD is an exclusion diagnosis, but it must come
to mind in the workup of chronic diarrhea, weight loss,
lower gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, and in-
testinal obstruction, once malignancies and tuberculosis
have been ruled out (Table 4).13,32

In high suspicion cases, some diagnostic studies that
may be useful are a colonoscopy and serologic test. Colo-
noscopy may show important macroscopic characteristics
like deep linear ulcers with patchy distribution, which may
affect the whole gastrointestinal tract or just a segment.
Other suggestive findings are abscesses, fistulas or steno-
sis. Histological findings are non-necrotizing granulomas
and signs of chronic inflammation.

Laboratory findings that are useful in CD are hypoal-

leukocytosis.33 The serologic markers of clinical impor-
tance are the anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies
(ASCA) which are commonly positive in CD and antineu-
trophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) negative for CD.34

These tests are suggestive of CD but are not meant to
be interpreted as a diagnostic test, as up they could be
positive  in  a  healthy  population.35  The  main  utility  of
these antibodies is in patients with characteristics of CD
and other diseases including UC, for differential diagno-
sis (Table 5).

Treatment and prognosis of the disease depend on seve-
ral factors, the Montreal Classification considers age of
onset, location, behavior of the disease and presence of
perianal disease for categorization; many decisions regarding
diagnostic approach, treatment, follow-up, and prediction of
several outcomes from response to therapy, to long-term prog-
nosis, depend on this classification (Table 6).36

On the other hand, for classification of severity, there
is an extensive number of validated scores like the Crohn’s
disease activity index (CDAI), mainly used in clinical trials
because of complexity, and the Harvey-Bradshaw activity
Index used in the clinical setting due to its simplicity
(Table 7).37-39

TREATMENT OF
CROHN’S DISEASE

Treatment of CD should be guided by severity, beha-
vior, disease location, appearance of complications, treat-
ment refractoriness and dependency to steroids. CD treat-
ment is divided into drugs inducing remission and for ma-
intenance of remission (Table 8).2

Different types of steroids may be use in a flare, howe-
ver  steroids  should  not  be  used  as  a  maintenance

For induction of remission, Prednisolone 40 mg/day, in
a reduction regimen, achieves quick clinical response.
The evidence shows higher doses do not give greater
benefit and do elevate the number of adverse reactions.
Drug suspension must be done through a reduction
scheme, with an approximate duration of 8 weeks, as
abrupt reductions are associated to more reactivations.
On the other hand, doses < 15 mg/day have been
useless for induction to remission.

There  is  a  group  of  patients  that  will  fail  to  steroid
therapy; these are known as refractory and those who
do not achieve remission without the use of steroids known
as  steroid  dependent.  We  can  use  Thiopurines  as
Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine as sparing steroid.

Second line drug therapy
in Crohn’s disease:
immunomodulators

A standardized reduction scheme helps to identify re-
fractory patients, and who may need an adjuvant therapy.
Resistance and lack of response to steroid therapy should
make us consider surgery. Some second line medical thera-
pies include an inmunosupressor appropriate for the severity
and type of disease. Therapy escalation should be conside-
red  in  patients  having  a  severe  reactivation  or  frequent
events, patients requiring two or more steroid courses in a
12-month time lapse, those with activation when the ste-
roid dose falls below 15 mg/day and those presenting re-
lapse in the first 6 weeks after steroid cessation (Table 9).

or 6-mercaptopurine in a 0.75 to 1.5 mg/kg day dose,
might be useful for inducing remission or as a mainte-
nance therapy in patients that fail or are intolerant to
5-ASA  and  that  require  recurrent  steroid  cycles.  Al-
though its effect is delayed, between 4-6 weeks, and
its  use  alone  is  not  recommended,  it  is  useful  as  a
sparing steroid agent and in the treatment of CD with
fistulas of any type. It is important to exclude other
complications  as  occlusion  or  abscesses.  The  more
common side effects are allergic reactions, leucope-
nia, pancreatitis, bone marrow and liver toxicity.43

induction and maintenance treatment of patients with
CD in those patients intolerant or resistant to thiopuri-
ne treatment. Methotrexate should be administered
with 5 mg of folinic acid after three days of administra-
tion, to diminish its adverse effects associated with the
inhibition of the dihydrofolate reductase.44-46
The  most  common  adverse  effects  of  this  drug  are
gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomit, diarrhea or
stomatitis), hepatotoxicity, neumonitis and infection
associated with opportunistic agents. Methotrexate is
also a teratogenic agent and is contraindicated during
pregnancy or in women on reproductive age without
an effective anticonception therapy. Pregnancy should
be planned up to 6 months after the drug suspension.
It is also not recommended during breast feeding and
ethanol consumption should be also avoided.

all current guidelines recommend Anti TNF as second
line therapy for IBD the use of these drugs. Anti TNF
used for treatment of CD are adalimumab, infliximab
and certolizumab pegol.47-49 There is some recent in-
formation that suggest that these drugs may be used
as first-line therapies in CD of recent diagnosis, espe-
cially infliximab and azathioprine, this strategy is known
as “top-down”, treatment and the evidence shows quick
remission in patients with this therapy mode.50,51

there are three useful drugs for patients with CD, nata-

delines still not consider the use of this drugs for the
treatment  of  IBD,  but  there  is  recent  evidence  that
has shown its utility.52

Crohn’s disease

Adjuvants, prevention
and other therapies

IBD frequently coexists with mood disorders, especially
depression and anxiety disorders. When reactivation
occurs they commonly find themselves frustrated as their
quality of life change. The Quality of life at one year of
diagnosis is worst for CD over UC. It is important to consider
these aspects and to offer a multidisciplinary treatment
that includes a psychiatrist and a psychologist.

Cigarette smoking cessation is one of the most impor-
tant measures, as it is associated with a greater risk of
exacerbation.

Problems due to malabsorption, such as anemia, vita-
min D deficiency, and/or osteoporosis, should be recogni-
zed and treated. It is recommended, even in active pa-
tients, to have enteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition is not
recommended as first line nutrition strategy.

Antibiotics are useful in the treatment of abscesses or
when it is difficult to distinguish between disease activity
from infectious diarrhea. Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole
are  useful  in  CD  for  the  treatment  of  perineal  activity.
Probiotics and prebiotics are not recommended 53.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoi-
ded, as they have been found as exacerbating agents.
Also, there are some associations between the regular use
of aspirin and the development of CD.

Surgical therapy

This therapy is useful in refractory disease and when
complications develop such as occlusion, abscess, and fis-
tulas. Before a surgical treatment is planned, we must first
come to a consensus between doctors and patient, since it
is not a curative therapy, and the disease might reactivate
we must make an informed and bilateral decision.54

Prognosis

Almost all patients with CD have complications; the
perianal disease is present in approximately 50%. Approxi-
mately, 40% will develop active disease within the first 3
years and only a small percentage remains inactive over
time. The majority will require bowel resections and seve-
ral surgeries. A review showed that after 10 years of diag-
nosis,  85%  had  the  same  location;  however,  the  initial
pattern will change after 25 years. 55 Stenosis or penetra-
ting complications will be found in 60% of patients in the
first  5  years,  which  will  require  intensive  medical  treat-
ment (immunomodulatory and /or biological therapy).

Over time, 77% of patients will show intermittent activity,

10% a prolonged remission and 13% a chronic activity.

Age under 40 years, presence of perianal disease and
premature need for corticosteroid therapy are predictors
of aggressive disease. The presence or absence of these,
represent a guide for decision making to regulate mana-
gement and treatment.

CONCLUSIONS

We  have  done  an  extensive  review  of  the  available
medical literature regarding CD. Although it is a rare mul-
tifactorial disease, the incidence and prevalence are in-
creasing.

It  frequently  affects  young  patients,  making  it  an
economic and social expensive disease. Complications can
be  severe;  prompt  diagnosis  and  early  treatment  are
essential  to  yield  a  better  prognosis.  Even  though  the
pathophysiology and risk factors have been exhaustively
studied,  definite  etiology  has  not  been  demonstrated.
Treatment  is  intended  to  induce  remission  and  to
maintain the disease inactive. Nevertheless, improvement
and development of novel treatment agents is targeted
for improving prognosis and quality of life.

HIGHLIGHTS

• Crohn’s disease is characterized by the involvement of
the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, with a
transmural pattern of inflammation of gastrointestinal
wall layers.

• A  “North  to  South  gradient”  of  incidence  has  been
suggested previously in several publications. However,
this gradient is not widely accepted since the lack of
information of IBD in southern countries.

• Although the etiology is not completely understood,
multiple  mechanisms  have  been  described.  The
Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain containing
2 (NOD2) is the first susceptibility gene strongly asso-
ciated with CD, expressed in the intestinal epithelium,
especially in Paneth cells. Three genetic variants within
the gene CARD15/NOD2 are present in up to 30% of
Caucasian patients with CD.

• In  our  media,  owing  to  the  fact  that  CD  has  a  low
prevalence, CD is an exclusion diagnosis, but it must
come to mind in the workup of chronic diarrhea, weight
loss, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain,
and intestinal obstruction.

• Treatment of CD should be guided by severity, beha-
vior, disease location, anatomic site, appearance of

complications, treatment refractoriness and dependency
to steroids. CD treatment is divided into drugs indu-
cing remission and for maintenance of remission.
