## Issues Identified

- Document Graph dominates (96.6%) - separation would significantly reduce Neo4j size

## Recommendations

- Document Graph represents 96.6% of total entities. Consider Option A (indexes) or Option B (PostgreSQL) for chunk separation.
- Graph structure is ready for chunk separation. Recommend starting with Option A (Neo4j indexes + labels).
